  "2": "They will ban you from the synagogues. In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering service to God.",
  "3": "They will do these things because they haven't known the Father or Me.",
  "4": "But I have told you these things so that when their time comes you may remember I told them to you. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.",
  "5": "\"But now I am going away to Him who sent Me, and not one of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'",
  "6": "Yet, because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.",
  "7": "Nevertheless, I am telling you the truth. It is for your benefit that I go away, because if I don't go away the Counselor will not come to you. If I go, I will send Him to you.",
  "8": "When He comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment:",
  "9": "about sin, because they do not believe in Me;",
  "10": "about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me;",
  "11": "and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.",
  "12": "\"I still have many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.",
  "13": "When the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak whatever He hears. He will also declare to you what is to come.",
  "14": "He will glorify Me, because He will take from what is Mine and declare it to you.",
  "15": "Everything the Father has is Mine. This is why I told you that He takes from what is Mine and will declare it to you.",
  "16": "\"A little while and you will no longer see Me; again a little while and you will see Me.\"",
  "17": "Therefore some of His disciples said to one another, \"What is this He tells us: 'A little while and you will not see Me; again a little while and you will see Me'; and, 'because I am going to the Father'?\"",
  "18": "They said, \"What is this He is saying, 'A little while'? We don't know what He's talking about!\"",
  "19": "Jesus knew they wanted to question Him, so He said to them, \"Are you asking one another about what I said, 'A little while and you will not see Me; again a little while and you will see Me'?",
  "20": "\"I assure you: You will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice. You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy.",
  "21": "When a woman is in labor she has pain because her time has come. But when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the suffering because of the joy that a person has been born into the world.",
  "22": "So you also have sorrow now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.",
  "23": "In that day you will not ask Me anything. \"I assure you: Anything you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.",
  "24": "Until now you have asked for nothing in My name. Ask and you will receive, that your joy may be complete.",

  "26": "In that day you will ask in My name. I am not telling you that I will make requests to the Father on your behalf.",
  "27": "For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God.",
  "28": "I came from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\"",
  "29": "\"Ah!\" His disciples said. \"Now You're speaking plainly and not using any figurative language.",
  "30": "Now we know that You know everything and don't need anyone to question You. By this we believe that You came from God.\"",
  "31": "Jesus responded to them, \"Do you now believe?",
  "32": "Look: An hour is coming, and has come, when each of you will be scattered to his own home, and you will leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.",
  "33": "I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. You will have suffering in this world. Be courageous! I have conquered the world.\""
