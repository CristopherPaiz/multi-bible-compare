  "1": "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.",
  "2": "At dawn He went to the temple complex again, and all the people were coming to Him. He sat down and began to teach them.",
  "3": "Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, making her stand in the center.",
  "4": "\"Teacher,\" they said to Him, \"this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.",
  "5": "In the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do You say?\"",
  "6": "They asked this to trap Him, in order that they might have evidence to accuse Him. Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with His finger.",
  "7": "When they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, \"The one without sin among you should be the first to throw a stone at her.\"",
  "8": "Then He stooped down again and continued writing on the ground.",
  "9": "When they heard this, they left one by one, starting with the older men. Only He was left, with the woman in the center.",
  "10": "When Jesus stood up, He said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"",
  "11": "\"No one, Lord,\" she answered. \"Neither do I condemn you,\" said Jesus. \"Go, and from now on do not sin any more.\"]]",
  "12": "Then Jesus spoke to them again: \"I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows Me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.\"",
  "13": "So the Pharisees said to Him, \"You are testifying about Yourself. Your testimony is not valid.\"",
  "14": "\"Even if I testify about Myself,\" Jesus replied, \"My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I'm going. But you don't know where I come from or where I'm going.",
  "15": "You judge by human standards. I judge no one.",
  "16": "And if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me [judge together].",
  "17": "Even in your law it is written that the witness of two men is valid.",
  "18": "I am the One who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.\"",
  "19": "Then they asked Him, \"Where is Your Father?\" \"You know neither Me nor My Father,\" Jesus answered. \"If you knew Me, you would also know My Father.\"",
  "20": "He spoke these words by the treasury, while teaching in the temple complex. But no one seized Him, because His hour had not come.",
  "21": "Then He said to them again, \"I'm going away; you will look for Me, and you will die in your sin. Where I'm going, you cannot come.\"",
  "22": "So the Jews said again, \"He won't kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I'm going, you cannot come'?\"",
  "23": "\"You are from below,\" He told them, \"I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.",
  "24": "Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am [He], you will die in your sins.\"",
  "25": "\"Who are You?\" they questioned. \"Precisely what I've been telling you from the very beginning,\" Jesus told them.",
  "26": "\"I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the One who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him-- these things I tell the world.\"",
  "27": "They did not know He was speaking to them about the Father.",
  "28": "So Jesus said to them, \"When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [He], and that I do nothing on My own. But just as the Father taught Me, I say these things.",
  "29": "The One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.\"",
  "30": "As He was saying these things, many believed in Him.",
  "31": "So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him, \"If you continue in My word, you really are My disciples.",
  "32": "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\"",
  "33": "\"We are descendants of Abraham,\" they answered Him, \"and we have never been enslaved to anyone. How can You say, 'You will become free'?\"",
  "34": "Jesus responded, \"I assure you: Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.",
  "35": "A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son does remain forever.",
  "36": "Therefore if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.",
  "37": "I know you are descendants of Abraham, but you are trying to kill Me because My word is not welcome among you.",
  "38": "I speak what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and therefore you do what you have heard from your father.\"",
  "39": "\"Our father is Abraham!\" they replied. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" Jesus told them, \"you would do what Abraham did.",
  "40": "But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this!",
  "41": "You're doing what your father does.\" \"We weren't born of sexual immorality,\" they said. \"We have one Father-- God.\"",
  "42": "Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love Me, because I came from God and I am here. For I didn't come on My own, but He sent Me.",
  "43": "Why don't you understand what I say? Because you cannot listen to My word.",
  "44": "You are of your father the Devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of liars.",
  "45": "Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.",
  "46": "Who among you can convict Me of sin? If I tell the truth, why don't you believe Me?",
  "47": "The one who is from God listens to God's words. This is why you don't listen, because you are not from God.\"",
  "48": "The Jews responded to Him, \"Aren't we right in saying that You're a Samaritan and have a demon?\"",
  "49": "\"I do not have a demon,\" Jesus answered. \"On the contrary, I honor My Father and you dishonor Me.",
  "50": "I do not seek My glory; the One who seeks it also judges.",
  "51": "I assure you: If anyone keeps My word, he will never see death-- ever!\"",
  "52": "Then the Jews said, \"Now we know You have a demon. Abraham died and so did the prophets. You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death-- ever!'",
  "53": "Are You greater than our father Abraham who died? Even the prophets died. Who do You pretend to be?\"",
  "54": "\"If I glorify Myself,\" Jesus answered, \"My glory is nothing. My Father-- you say about Him, 'He is our God.'-- He is the One who glorifies Me.",
  "55": "You've never known Him, but I know Him. If I were to say I don't know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.",
  "56": "Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see My day; he saw it and rejoiced.\"",
  "57": "The Jews replied, \"You aren't 50 years old yet, and You've seen Abraham?\"",
  "58": "Jesus said to them, \"I assure you: Before Abraham was, I am.\"",
  "59": "At that, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple complex."
