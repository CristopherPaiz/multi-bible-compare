  "10": "Then the disciples went home again.",
  "11": "But Mary stood outside facing the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she stooped to look into the tomb.",
  "12": "She saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet, where Jesus' body had been lying.",
  "13": "They said to her, \"Woman, why are you crying?\" \"Because they've taken away my Lord,\" she told them, \"and I don't know where they've put Him.\"",

  "15": "\"Woman,\" Jesus said to her, \"why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?\" Supposing He was the gardener, she replied, \"Sir, if you've removed Him, tell me where you've put Him, and I will take Him away.\"",
  "16": "Jesus said, \"Mary.\" Turning around, she said to Him in Hebrew, \"Rabbouni!\"-- which means \"Teacher.\"",

  "20": "Having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. So the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.",
  "21": "Jesus said to them again, \"Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.\"",

  "29": "Jesus said, \"Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Those who believe without seeing are blessed.\"",
