  "1": "\"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vineyard keeper.",
  "2": "Every branch in Me that does not produce fruit He removes, and He prunes every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce more fruit.",
  "3": "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.",
  "4": "Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me.",
  "5": "\"I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without Me.",
  "6": "If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown aside like a branch and he withers. They gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.",
  "7": "If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be done for you.",
  "8": "My Father is glorified by this: that you produce much fruit and prove to be My disciples.",
  "9": "\"As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in My love.",
  "10": "If you keep My commands you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commands and remain in His love.",
  "11": "\"I have spoken these things to you so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.",
  "12": "This is My command: love one another as I have loved you.",
  "13": "No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends.",
  "14": "You are My friends if you do what I command you.",
  "15": "I do not call you slaves anymore, because a slave doesn't know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from My Father.",
  "16": "You did not choose Me, but I chose you. I appointed you that you should go out and produce fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.",
  "17": "This is what I command you: love one another.",
  "18": "\"If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me before it hated you.",
  "19": "If you were of the world, the world would love [you as] its own. However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you.",
  "20": "Remember the word I spoke to you: 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will also keep yours.",
  "21": "But they will do all these things to you on account of My name, because they don't know the One who sent Me.",
  "22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. Now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "The one who hates Me also hates My Father.",
  "24": "If I had not done the works among them that no one else has done, they would not have sin. Now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.",
  "25": "But [this happened] so that the statement written in their law might be fulfilled: They hated Me for no reason.",
  "26": "\"When the Counselor comes, the One I will send to you from the Father-- the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father-- He will testify about Me.",
  "27": "You also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning."
