  "1": "Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children.",
  "2": "And walk in love, as the Messiah also loved us and gave Himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.",
  "3": "But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of among you, as is proper for saints.",
  "4": "And coarse and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks.",
  "5": "For know and recognize this: no sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for because of these things God's wrath is coming on the disobedient.",
  "7": "Therefore, do not become their partners.",
  "8": "For you were once darkness, but now [you are] light in the Lord. Walk as children of light--",
  "9": "for the fruit of the light [results] in all goodness, righteousness, and truth--",
  "10": "discerning what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Don't participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead, expose them.",
  "12": "For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret.",
  "13": "Everything exposed by the light is made clear,",
  "14": "for what makes everything clear is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and the Messiah will shine on you.",
  "15": "Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk-- not as unwise people but as wise--",

  "21": "submitting to one another in the fear of Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,",
  "23": "for the husband is head of the wife as also Christ is head of the church. He is the Savior of the body.",

  "27": "He did this to present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.",
  "28": "In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
  "29": "For no one ever hates his own flesh, but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,",
  "30": "since we are members of His body.",
  "31": "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.",
  "32": "This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church.",
  "33": "To sum up, each one of you is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband."
