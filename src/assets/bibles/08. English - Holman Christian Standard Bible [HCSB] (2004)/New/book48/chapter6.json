  "9": "So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up.",

  "15": "For both circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; [what matters] instead is a new creation.",
  "16": "May peace be on all those who follow this standard, and mercy also be on the Israel of God!",
  "17": "From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.",
  "18": "Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
