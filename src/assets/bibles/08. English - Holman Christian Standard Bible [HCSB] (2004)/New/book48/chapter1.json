  "1": "Paul, an apostle-- not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead--",
  "2": "and all the brothers who are with me: To the churches of Galatia.",
  "3": "Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "4": "who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,",
  "5": "to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.",
  "6": "I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from Him who called you by the grace of Christ, [and are turning] to a different gospel--",
  "7": "not that there is another [gospel], but there are some who are troubling you and want to change the gospel of Christ.",
  "8": "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you, a curse be on him!",
  "9": "As we have said before, I now say again: if anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!",
  "10": "For am I now trying to win the favor of people, or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.",
  "11": "Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not based on a human point of view.",
  "12": "For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation from Jesus Christ.",
  "13": "For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism: I persecuted God's church to an extreme degree and tried to destroy it;",
  "14": "and I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.",
  "15": "But when God, who from my mother's womb set me apart and called me by His grace, was pleased",
  "16": "to reveal His Son in me, so that I could preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone.",
  "17": "I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus.",
  "18": "Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him 15 days.",
  "19": "But I didn't see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.",
  "20": "Now in what I write to you, I'm not lying. God is my witness.",
  "21": "Afterwards, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
  "22": "I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches in Christ;",
  "23": "they simply kept hearing: \"He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy.\"",
  "24": "And they glorified God because of me."
