  "1": "Christ has liberated us into freedom. Therefore stand firm and don't submit again to a yoke of slavery.",
  "2": "Take note! I, Paul, tell you that if you get circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all.",
  "3": "Again I testify to every man who gets circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.",
  "4": "You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace!",
  "5": "For by the Spirit we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness from faith.",
  "6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.",
  "7": "You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?",
  "8": "This persuasion did not come from Him who called you.",
  "9": "A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough.",
  "10": "In the Lord I have confidence in you that you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is who is troubling you will pay the penalty.",
  "11": "Now brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.",

  "18": "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",
  "19": "Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity,",
  "20": "idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,",
  "21": "envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar, about which I tell you in advance-- as I told you before-- that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.",
  "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,",
  "23": "gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.",
  "24": "Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.",
  "25": "If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.",
  "26": "We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
