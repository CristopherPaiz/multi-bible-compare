  "1": "You foolish Galatians! Who has hypnotized you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified?",
  "2": "I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?",
  "3": "Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now going to be made complete by the flesh?",
  "4": "Did you suffer so much for nothing-- if in fact it was for nothing?",
  "5": "So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?",
  "6": "Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,",
  "7": "so understand that those who have faith are Abraham's sons.",
  "8": "Now the Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and foretold the good news to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed in you.",
  "9": "So those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith.",
  "10": "For all who [rely on] the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Cursed is everyone who does not continue doing everything written in the book of the law.",
  "11": "Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith.",
  "12": "But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them.",
  "13": "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written: Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.",
  "14": "The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
  "15": "Brothers, I'm using a human illustration. No one sets aside even a human covenant that has been ratified, or makes additions to it.",
  "16": "Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say \"and to seeds,\" as though referring to many, but and to your seed, referring to one, who is Christ.",
  "17": "And I say this: the law, which came 430 years later, does not revoke a covenant that was previously ratified by God, so as to cancel the promise.",
  "18": "For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.",
  "19": "Why the law then? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come. [The law] was ordered through angels by means of a mediator.",
  "20": "Now a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one.",
  "21": "Is the law therefore contrary to God's promises? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly be by the law.",
  "22": "But the Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin's power, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.",
  "23": "Before this faith came, we were confined under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed.",
  "24": "The law, then, was our guardian until Christ, so that we could be justified by faith.",
  "25": "But since that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,",
  "26": "for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
  "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.",
  "28": "There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
  "29": "And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to the promise."
