  "1": "Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to Him: we ask you, brothers,",
  "2": "not to be easily upset in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter as if from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has come.",
  "3": "Don't let anyone deceive you in any way. For [that day] will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.",
  "4": "He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in God's sanctuary, publicizing that he himself is God.",
  "5": "Don't you remember that when I was still with you I told you about this?",
  "6": "And you know what currently restrains [him], so that he will be revealed in his time.",
  "7": "For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; but the one now restraining will do so until he is out of the way,",
  "8": "and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of His mouth and will bring him to nothing with the brightness of His coming.",
  "9": "The coming [of the lawless one] is based on Satan's working, with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders,",
  "10": "and with every unrighteous deception among those who are perishing. [They perish] because they did not accept the love of the truth in order to be saved.",
  "11": "For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,",
  "12": "so that all will be condemned-- those who did not believe the truth but enjoyed unrighteousness.",
  "13": "But we must always thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God has chosen you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.",
  "14": "He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "15": "Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions you were taught, either by our message or by our letter.",
  "16": "May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace,",
  "17": "encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word."
