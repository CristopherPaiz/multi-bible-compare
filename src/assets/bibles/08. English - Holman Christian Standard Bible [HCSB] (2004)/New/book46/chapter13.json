  "1": "If I speak the languages of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal.",
  "2": "If I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so that I can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "And if I donate all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.",
  "4": "Love is patient; love is kind. Love does not envy; is not boastful; is not conceited;",
  "5": "does not act improperly; is not selfish; is not provoked; does not keep a record of wrongs;",
  "6": "finds no joy in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth;",
  "7": "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for languages, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.",

  "10": "But when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end.",
  "11": "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things.",
  "12": "For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known.",
  "13": "Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."
