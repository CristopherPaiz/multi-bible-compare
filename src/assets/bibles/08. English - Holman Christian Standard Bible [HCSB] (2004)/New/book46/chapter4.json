  "1": "A person should consider us in this way: as servants of Christ and managers of God's mysteries.",
  "2": "In this regard, it is expected of managers that each one be found faithful.",
  "3": "It is of little importance that I should be evaluated by you or by a human court. In fact, I don't even evaluate myself.",
  "4": "For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this. The One who evaluates me is the Lord.",
  "5": "Therefore don't judge anything prematurely, before the Lord comes, who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God.",
  "6": "Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the saying: \"Nothing beyond what is written.\" The purpose is that none of you will be inflated with pride in favor of one person over another.",
  "7": "For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you didn't receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn't received it?",
  "8": "Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have begun to reign as kings without us-- and I wish you did reign, so that we also could reign with you!",
  "9": "For I think God has displayed us, the apostles, in last place, like men condemned to die: we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.",
  "10": "We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!",
  "11": "Up to the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, homeless;",
  "12": "we labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;",
  "13": "when we are slandered, we entreat. We are, even now, like the world's garbage, like the filth of all things.",
  "14": "I'm not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.",
  "15": "For you can have 10,000 instructors in Christ, but you can't have many fathers. Now I have fathered you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.",
  "16": "Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.",
  "17": "This is why I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you about my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
  "18": "Now some are inflated with pride, as though I were not coming to you.",
  "19": "But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk but the power of those who are inflated with pride.",
  "20": "For the kingdom of God is not in talk but in power.",
  "21": "What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
