  "1": "About matters of the spirit: brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.",
  "2": "You know how, when you were pagans, you were led to dumb idols-- being led astray.",
  "3": "Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, \"Jesus is cursed,\" and no one can say, \"Jesus is Lord,\" except by the Holy Spirit.",
  "4": "Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit.",
  "5": "There are different ministries, but the same Lord.",
  "6": "And there are different activities, but the same God is active in everyone and everything.",
  "7": "A manifestation of the Spirit is given to each person to produce what is beneficial:",
  "8": "to one is given a message of wisdom through the Spirit, to another, a message of knowledge by the same Spirit,",
  "9": "to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit,",
  "10": "to another, the performing of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, distinguishing between spirits, to another, different kinds of languages, to another, interpretation of languages.",
  "11": "But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each one as He wills.",
  "12": "For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of that body, though many, are one body-- so also is Christ.",
  "13": "For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body-- whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free-- and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.",
  "14": "So the body is not one part but many.",
  "15": "If the foot should say, \"Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body,\" in spite of this it still belongs to the body.",
  "16": "And if the ear should say, \"Because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body,\" in spite of this it still belongs to the body.",
  "17": "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?",
  "18": "But now God has placed the parts, each one of them, in the body just as He wanted.",
  "19": "And if they were all the same part, where would the body be?",
  "20": "Now there are many parts, yet one body.",
  "21": "So the eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" nor again the head to the feet, \"I don't need you!\"",
  "22": "On the contrary, all the more, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary.",
  "23": "And those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe these with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts have a better presentation.",
  "24": "But our presentable parts have no need [of clothing]. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable,",
  "25": "so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other.",
  "26": "So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.",
  "27": "Now you are the body of Christ, and individual members of it.",
  "28": "And God has placed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, next, miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, managing, various kinds of languages.",
  "29": "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?",
  "30": "Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in languages? Do all interpret?",
  "31": "But desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even better way."
