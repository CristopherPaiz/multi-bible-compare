  "1": "Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.",
  "2": "I fed you milk, not solid food, because you were not yet able to receive it. In fact, you are still not able,",
  "3": "because you are still fleshly. For since there is envy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living like ordinary people?",
  "4": "For whenever someone says, \"I'm with Paul,\" and another, \"I'm with Apollos,\" are you not [typical] men?",
  "5": "So, what is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.",
  "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.",
  "7": "So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.",
  "8": "Now the one who plants and the one who waters are equal, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
  "9": "For we are God's co-workers. You are God's field, God's building.",
  "10": "According to God's grace that was given to me, as a skilled master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it,",
  "11": "because no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid-- that is, Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
  "13": "each one's work will become obvious, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one's work.",
  "14": "If anyone's work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward.",
  "15": "If anyone's work is burned up, it will be lost, but he will be saved; yet it will be like an escape through fire.",
  "16": "Don't you know that you are God's sanctuary and that the Spirit of God lives in you?",
  "17": "If anyone ruins God's sanctuary, God will ruin him; for God's sanctuary is holy, and that is what you are.",
  "18": "No one should deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become foolish so that he can become wise.",
  "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness--",
  "20": "and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.",
  "21": "So no one should boast in men, for all things are yours:",
  "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come-- all are yours,",
  "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ to God."
