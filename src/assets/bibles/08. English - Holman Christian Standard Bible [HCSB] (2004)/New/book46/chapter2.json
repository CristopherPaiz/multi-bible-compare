  "1": "When I came to you, brothers, announcing the testimony of God to you, I did not come with brilliance of speech or wisdom.",
  "2": "For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.",
  "3": "And I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.",
  "4": "My speech and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,",
  "5": "so that your faith might not be based on men's wisdom but on God's power.",
  "6": "However, among the mature we do speak a wisdom, but not a wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.",
  "7": "On the contrary, we speak God's hidden wisdom in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.",
  "8": "None of the rulers of this age knew it, for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
  "9": "But as it is written: What no eye has seen and no ear has heard, and what has never come into a man's heart, is what God has prepared for those who love Him.",
  "10": "Now God has revealed them to us by the Spirit, for the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.",
  "11": "For who among men knows the concerns of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? In the same way, no one knows the concerns of God except the Spirit of God.",
  "12": "Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order to know what has been freely given to us by God.",
  "13": "We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.",
  "14": "But the natural man does not welcome what comes from God's Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to know it since it is evaluated spiritually.",
  "15": "The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone.",
  "16": "For: who has known the Lord's mind, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ."
