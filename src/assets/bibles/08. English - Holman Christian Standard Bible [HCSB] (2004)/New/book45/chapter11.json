  "1": "I ask, then, has God rejected His people? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "2": "God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the Elijah section-- how he pleads with God against Israel?",
  "3": "Lord, they have killed Your prophets, torn down Your altars; and I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life!",
  "4": "But what was God's reply to him? I have left 7,000 men for Myself who have not bowed down to Baal.",
  "5": "In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace.",
  "6": "Now if by grace, then it is not by works; otherwise grace ceases to be grace.",
  "7": "What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened,",
  "8": "as it is written: God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that cannot see and ears that cannot hear, to this day.",
  "9": "And David says: Let their feasting become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution to them.",
  "10": "Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent continually.",
  "11": "I ask, then, have they stumbled so as to fall? Absolutely not! On the contrary, by their stumbling, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.",
  "12": "Now if their stumbling brings riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full number bring!",
  "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. In view of the fact that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,",
  "14": "if I can somehow make my own people jealous and save some of them.",
  "15": "For if their being rejected is world reconciliation, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?",
  "16": "Now if the firstfruits offered up are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.",
  "17": "Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them, and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree,",
  "18": "do not brag that you are better than those branches. But if you do brag-- you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you.",
  "19": "Then you will say, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\"",
  "20": "True enough; they were broken off by unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.",
  "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either.",
  "22": "Therefore, consider God's kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you-- if you remain in His kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.",
  "23": "And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again.",
  "24": "For if you were cut off from your native wild olive, and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these-- the natural branches-- be grafted into their own olive tree?",
  "25": "So that you will not be conceited, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery: a partial hardening has come to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.",
  "26": "And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Liberator will come from Zion; He will turn away godlessness from Jacob.",
  "27": "And this will be My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.",
  "28": "Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of their forefathers,",
  "29": "since God's gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable.",
  "30": "As you once disobeyed God, but now have received mercy through their disobedience,",
  "31": "so they too have now disobeyed, [resulting] in mercy to you, so that they also now may receive mercy.",
  "32": "For God has imprisoned all in disobedience, so that He may have mercy on all.",
  "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable His ways!",
  "34": "For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?",
  "35": "Or who has ever first given to Him, and has to be repaid?",
  "36": "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen."
