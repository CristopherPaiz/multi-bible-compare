  "3": "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do good and you will have its approval.",
  "4": "For government is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For government is God's servant, an avenger that brings wrath on the one who does wrong.",
  "5": "Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath, but also because of your conscience.",

  "8": "Do not owe anyone anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.",
  "9": "The commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and if there is any other commandment-- all are summed up by this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.",
  "10": "Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.",

  "12": "The night is nearly over, and the daylight is near, so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.",
  "13": "Let us walk with decency, as in the daylight: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy.",
  "14": "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no plans to satisfy the fleshly desires."
