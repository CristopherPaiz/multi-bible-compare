  "1": "I speak the truth in Christ-- I am not lying; my conscience is testifying to me with the Holy Spirit--",
  "2": "that I have intense sorrow and continual anguish in my heart.",
  "3": "For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from the Messiah for the benefit of my brothers, my countrymen by physical descent.",
  "4": "They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises.",
  "5": "The forefathers are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Messiah, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.",
  "6": "But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.",
  "7": "Neither are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants. On the contrary, in Isaac your seed will be called.",
  "8": "That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but the children of the promise are considered seed.",
  "9": "For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.",
  "10": "And not only that, but also when Rebekah became pregnant by Isaac our forefather",
  "11": "(for though they had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to election might stand,",
  "12": "not from works but from the One who calls) she was told: The older will serve the younger.",
  "13": "As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.",
  "14": "What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!",
  "15": "For He tells Moses: I will show mercy to whom I show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.",
  "16": "So then it does not depend on human will or effort, but on God who shows mercy.",
  "17": "For the Scripture tells Pharaoh: For this reason I raised you up: so that I may display My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.",
  "18": "So then, He shows mercy to whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.",
  "19": "You will say to me, therefore, \"Why then does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?\"",
  "20": "But who are you-- anyone who talks back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, \"Why did you make me like this?\"",
  "21": "Or has the potter no right over His clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor?",
  "22": "And what if God, desiring to display His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath ready for destruction?",
  "23": "And [what if] He did this to make known the riches of His glory on objects of mercy that He prepared beforehand for glory--",
  "24": "on us whom He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?",
  "25": "As He also says in Hosea: I will call \"Not-My-People,\" \"My-People,\" and she who is \"Unloved,\" \"Beloved.\"",
  "26": "And it will be in the place where they were told, you are not My people, there they will be called sons of the living God.",
  "27": "But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: Though the number of Israel's sons is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved;",
  "28": "for the Lord will execute His sentence completely and decisively on the earth.",
  "29": "And just as Isaiah predicted: If the Lord of Hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.",
  "30": "What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness-- namely the righteousness that comes from faith.",
  "31": "But Israel, pursuing the law for righteousness, has not achieved the law.",
  "32": "Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.",
  "33": "As it is written: Look! I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over, and a rock to trip over, yet the one who believes on Him will not be put to shame."
