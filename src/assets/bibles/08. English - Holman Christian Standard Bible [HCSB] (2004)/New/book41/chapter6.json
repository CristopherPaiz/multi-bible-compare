  "1": "He went away from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.",
  "2": "When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. \"Where did this man get these things?\" they said. \"What is this wisdom given to Him, and how are these miracles performed by His hands?",
  "3": "Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren't His sisters here with us?\" So they were offended by Him.",
  "4": "Then Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his household.\"",
  "5": "So He was not able to do any miracles there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.",
  "6": "And He was amazed at their unbelief. Now He was going around the villages in a circuit, teaching.",
  "7": "He summoned the Twelve and began to send them out in pairs and gave them authority over unclean spirits.",
  "8": "He instructed them to take nothing for the road except a walking stick: no bread, no traveling bag, no money in their belts.",
  "9": "They were to wear sandals, but not put on an extra shirt.",
  "10": "Then He said to them, \"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.",
  "11": "If any place does not welcome you and people refuse to listen to you, when you leave there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\"",
  "12": "So they went out and preached that people should repent.",
  "13": "And they were driving out many demons, anointing many sick people with oil, and healing.",
  "14": "King Herod heard of this, because Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that's why supernatural powers are at work in him.\"",
  "15": "But others said, \"He's Elijah.\" Still others said, \"He's a prophet-- like one of the prophets.\"",
  "16": "When Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, the one I beheaded, has been raised!\"",
  "17": "For Herod himself had given orders to arrest John and to chain him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.",
  "18": "John had been telling Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife!\"",
  "19": "So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not,",
  "20": "because Herod was in awe of John and was protecting him, knowing he was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him he would be very disturbed, yet would hear him gladly.",
  "21": "Now an opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.",
  "22": "When Herodias' own daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, \"Ask me whatever you want, and I'll give it to you.\"",
  "23": "So he swore oaths to her: \"Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\"",
  "24": "Then she went out and said to her mother, \"What should I ask for?\" \"John the Baptist's head!\" she said.",
  "25": "Immediately she hurried to the king and said, \"I want you to give me John the Baptist's head on a platter-- right now!\"",
  "26": "Though the king was deeply distressed, because of his oaths and the guests he did not want to refuse her.",
  "27": "The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in prison,",
  "28": "brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother.",
  "29": "When his disciples heard about it, they came and removed his corpse and placed it in a tomb.",
  "30": "The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to Him all that they had done and taught.",
  "31": "He said to them, \"Come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest a while.\" For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.",
  "32": "So they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place,",
  "33": "but many saw them leaving and recognized them. People ran there by land from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.",
  "34": "So as He stepped ashore, He saw a huge crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. Then He began to teach them many things.",
  "35": "When it was already late, His disciples approached Him and said, \"This place is a wilderness, and it is already late!",
  "36": "Send them away, so they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.\"",
  "37": "\"You give them something to eat,\" He responded. They said to Him, \"Should we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?\"",
  "38": "And He asked them, \"How many loaves do you have? Go look.\" When they found out they said, \"Five, and two fish.\"",
  "39": "Then He instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.",
  "40": "So they sat down in ranks of hundreds and fifties.",
  "41": "Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to His disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.",
  "42": "Everyone ate and was filled.",
  "43": "Then they picked up 12 baskets full of pieces of bread and fish.",
  "44": "Now those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men.",
  "45": "Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.",
  "46": "After He said good-bye to them, He went away to the mountain to pray.",
  "47": "When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.",
  "48": "He saw them being battered as they rowed, because the wind was against them. Around three in the morning He came toward them walking on the sea and wanted to pass by them.",
  "49": "When they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out;",
  "50": "for they all saw Him and were terrified. Immediately He spoke with them and said, \"Have courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\"",
  "51": "Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded,",
  "52": "because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.",
  "53": "When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and beached the boat.",
  "54": "As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Him.",
  "55": "They hurried throughout that vicinity and began to carry the sick on stretchers to wherever they heard He was.",
  "56": "Wherever He would go, into villages, towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch just the tassel of His robe. And everyone who touched it was made well."
