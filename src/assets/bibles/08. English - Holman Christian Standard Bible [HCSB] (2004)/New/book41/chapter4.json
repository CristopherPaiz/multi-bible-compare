  "1": "Again He began to teach by the sea, and a very large crowd gathered around Him. So He got into a boat on the sea and sat down, while the whole crowd was on the shore facing the sea.",
  "2": "He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them:",
  "3": "\"Listen! Consider the sower who went out to sow.",
  "4": "As he sowed, this occurred: Some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.",
  "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground where it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up right away, since it didn't have deep soil.",
  "6": "When the sun came up, it was scorched, and since it didn't have a root, it withered.",
  "7": "Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it didn't produce a crop.",
  "8": "Still others fell on good ground and produced a crop that increased 30, 60, and 100 times [what was sown].\"",
  "9": "Then He said, \"Anyone who has ears to hear should listen!\"",
  "10": "When He was alone with the Twelve, those who were around Him asked Him about the parables.",
  "11": "He answered them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been granted to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables",
  "12": "so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back-- and be forgiven.\"",
  "13": "Then He said to them: \"Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand any of the parables?",
  "14": "The sower sows the word.",
  "15": "These are the ones along the path where the word is sown: when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word sown in them.",
  "16": "And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy.",
  "17": "But they have no root in themselves; they are short-lived. When affliction or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately stumble.",
  "18": "Others are sown among thorns; these are the ones who hear the word,",
  "19": "but the worries of this age, the seduction of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
  "20": "But the ones sown on good ground are those who hear the word, welcome it, and produce a crop: 30, 60, and 100 times [what was sown].\"",
  "21": "He also said to them, \"Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it to be put on a lampstand?",
  "22": "For nothing is concealed except to be revealed, and nothing hidden except to come to light.",
  "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, he should listen!\"",
  "24": "Then He said to them, \"Pay attention to what you hear. By the measure you use, it will be measured and added to you.",
  "25": "For to the one who has, it will be given, and from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.\"",
  "26": "\"The kingdom of God is like this,\" He said. \"A man scatters seed on the ground;",
  "27": "he sleeps and rises-- night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows-- he doesn't know how.",
  "28": "The soil produces a crop by itself-- first the blade, then the head, and then the ripe grain on the head.",
  "29": "But as soon as the crop is ready, he sends for the sickle, because harvest has come.\"",
  "30": "And He said: \"How can we illustrate the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to describe it?",
  "31": "It's like a mustard seed that, when sown in the soil, is smaller than all the seeds on the ground.",
  "32": "And when sown, it comes up and grows taller than all the vegetables, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the sky can nest in its shade.\"",
  "33": "He would speak the word to them with many parables like these, as they were able to understand.",
  "34": "And He did not speak to them without a parable. Privately, however, He would explain everything to His own disciples.",
  "35": "On that day, when evening had come, He told them, \"Let's cross over to the other side [of the lake].\"",
  "36": "So they left the crowd and took Him along since He was [already] in the boat. And other boats were with Him.",
  "37": "A fierce windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped.",
  "38": "But He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him up and said to Him, \"Teacher! Don't you care that we're going to die?\"",
  "39": "He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \"Silence! Be still!\" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.",
  "40": "Then He said to them, \"Why are you fearful? Do you still have no faith?\"",
  "41": "And they were terrified and asked one another, \"Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!\""
