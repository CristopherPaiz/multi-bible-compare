  "1": "As He was going out of the temple complex, one of His disciples said to Him, \"Teacher, look! What massive stones! What impressive buildings!\"",
  "2": "Jesus said to him, \"Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here on another that will not be thrown down!\"",
  "3": "While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple complex, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,",
  "4": "\"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to take place?\"",
  "5": "Then Jesus began by telling them: \"Watch out that no one deceives you.",
  "6": "Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and they will deceive many.",
  "7": "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet.",
  "8": "For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.",
  "9": "\"But you, be on your guard! They will hand you over to sanhedrins, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of Me, as a witness to them.",
  "10": "And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.",
  "11": "So when they arrest you and hand you over, don't worry beforehand what you will say. On the contrary, whatever is given to you in that hour-- say it. For it isn't you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.",
  "12": "Then brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against parents and put them to death.",
  "13": "And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. But the one who endures to the end will be delivered.",
  "14": "\"When you see the abomination that causes desolation standing where it should not\" (let the reader understand), \"then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!",
  "15": "A man on the housetop must not come down or go in to get anything out of his house.",
  "16": "And a man in the field must not go back to get his clothes.",
  "17": "Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!",
  "18": "Pray it won't happen in winter.",
  "19": "For those will be days of tribulation, the kind that hasn't been from the beginning of the world, which God created, until now and never will be again!",
  "20": "Unless the Lord limited those days, no one would survive. But He limited those days because of the elect, whom He chose.",
  "21": "\"Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Messiah! Look-- there!' do not believe it!",
  "22": "For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the elect.",
  "23": "And you must watch! I have told you everything in advance.",
  "24": "\"But in those days, after that tribulation: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light;",
  "25": "the stars will be falling from the sky, and the celestial powers will be shaken.",
  "26": "Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.",
  "27": "He will send out the angels and gather His elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.",
  "28": "\"Learn this parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.",
  "29": "In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that He is near-- at the door!",
  "30": "I assure you: This generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place.",
  "31": "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.",
  "32": "\"Now concerning that day or hour no one knows-- neither the angels in heaven nor the Son-- except the Father.",
  "33": "Watch! Be alert! For you don't know when the time is [coming].",
  "34": "It is like a man on a journey, who left his house, gave authority to his slaves, gave each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to be alert.",
  "35": "Therefore be alert, since you don't know when the master of the house is coming-- whether in the evening or at midnight or at the crowing of the rooster or early in the morning.",
  "36": "Otherwise, he might come suddenly and find you sleeping.",
  "37": "And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert!\""
