  "3": "Do nothing out of rivalry or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves.",
  "4": "Everyone should look out not [only] for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.",
  "5": "Make your own attitude that of Christ Jesus,",
  "6": "who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be used for His own advantage.",
  "7": "Instead He emptied Himself by assuming the form of a slave, taking on the likeness of men. And when He had come as a man in His external form,",
  "8": "He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death-- even to death on a cross.",
  "9": "For this reason God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name,",

  "11": "and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",
  "12": "So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.",

  "18": "In the same way you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.",
  "19": "Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I also may be encouraged when I hear news about you.",
  "20": "For I have no one else like-minded who will genuinely care about your interests;",
  "21": "all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.",
  "22": "But you know his proven character, because he has served with me in the gospel ministry like a son with a father.",
  "23": "Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.",
  "24": "And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will also come quickly.",
  "25": "But I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus-- my brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier, as well as your messenger and minister to my need--",
  "26": "since he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.",
  "27": "Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly died. However, God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one grief on top of another.",
  "28": "For this reason, I am very eager to send him so that you may rejoice when you see him again and I may be less anxious.",
  "29": "Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in honor,",
  "30": "because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up what was lacking in your ministry to me."
