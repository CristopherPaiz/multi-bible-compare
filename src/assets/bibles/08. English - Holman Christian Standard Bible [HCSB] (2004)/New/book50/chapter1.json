  "3": "I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you,",
  "4": "always praying with joy for all of you in my every prayer,",
  "5": "because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.",
  "6": "I am sure of this, that He who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.",
  "7": "It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, and you are all partners with me in grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and establishment of the gospel.",
  "8": "For God is my witness, how I deeply miss all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.",
  "9": "And I pray this: that your love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,",
  "10": "so that you can determine what really matters and can be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,",
  "11": "filled with the fruit of righteousness that [comes] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.",
  "12": "Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advancement of the gospel,",
  "13": "so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard, and to everyone else, that my imprisonment is for Christ.",
  "14": "Most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the message fearlessly.",
  "15": "Some, to be sure, preach Christ out of envy and strife, but others out of good will.",
  "16": "These do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;",
  "17": "the others proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely, seeking to cause [me] trouble in my imprisonment.",
  "18": "What does it matter? Just that in every way, whether out of false motives or true, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice",
  "19": "because I know this will lead to my deliverance through your prayers and help from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.",

  "22": "Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful work for me; and I don't know which one I should choose.",
  "23": "I am pressured by both. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ-- which is far better--",
  "24": "but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.",
  "25": "Since I am persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your advancement and joy in the faith,",
  "26": "so that, because of me, your confidence may grow in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.",
  "27": "Just one thing: live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, working side by side for the faith of the gospel,",
  "28": "not being frightened in any way by your opponents. This is evidence of their destruction, but of your deliverance-- and this is from God.",
  "29": "For it has been given to you on Christ's behalf not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,",
  "30": "having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear about me."
