  "1": "When daybreak came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death.",
  "2": "After tying Him up, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate, the governor.",
  "3": "Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was full of remorse and returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.",
  "4": "\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,\" he said. \"What's that to us?\" they said. \"See to it yourself!\"",
  "5": "So he threw the silver into the sanctuary and departed. Then he went and hanged himself.",
  "6": "The chief priests took the silver and said, \"It's not lawful to put it into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.\"",
  "7": "So they conferred together and bought the potter's field with it as a burial place for foreigners.",
  "8": "Therefore that field has been called \"Blood Field\" to this day.",
  "9": "Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: They took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of Him whose price was set by the sons of Israel,",
  "10": "and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.",
  "11": "Now Jesus stood before the governor. \"Are You the King of the Jews?\" the governor asked Him. Jesus answered, \"You have said it.\"",
  "12": "And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He didn't answer.",
  "13": "Then Pilate said to Him, \"Don't You hear how much they are testifying against You?\"",
  "14": "But He didn't answer him on even one charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.",
  "15": "At the festival the governor's custom was to release to the crowd a prisoner they wanted.",
  "16": "At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.",
  "17": "So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, \"Who is it you want me to release for you-- Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Messiah?\"",
  "18": "For he knew they had handed Him over because of envy.",
  "19": "While he was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent word to him, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I've suffered terribly in a dream because of Him!\"",
  "20": "The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus.",
  "21": "The governor asked them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" \"Barabbas!\" they answered.",
  "22": "Pilate asked them, \"What should I do then with Jesus, who is called Messiah?\" They all answered, \"Crucify Him!\"",
  "23": "Then he said, \"Why? What has He done wrong?\" But they kept shouting, \"Crucify Him!\" all the more.",
  "24": "When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting instead, he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, \"I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves!\"",
  "25": "All the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\"",
  "26": "Then he released Barabbas to them. But after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified.",
  "27": "Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into headquarters and gathered the whole company around Him.",
  "28": "They stripped Him and dressed Him in a scarlet robe.",
  "29": "They twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on His head, and placed a reed in His right hand. And they knelt down before Him and mocked Him: \"Hail, King of the Jews!\"",
  "30": "Then they spit at Him, took the reed, and kept hitting Him on the head.",
  "31": "When they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, put His clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.",
  "32": "As they were going out, they found a Cyrenian man named Simon. They forced this man to carry His cross.",
  "33": "When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Skull Place),",
  "34": "they gave Him wine mixed with gall to drink. But when He tasted it, He would not drink it.",
  "35": "After crucifying Him they divided His clothes by casting lots.",
  "36": "Then they sat down and were guarding Him there.",
  "37": "Above His head they put up the charge against Him in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS",
  "38": "Then two criminals were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.",
  "39": "Those who passed by were yelling insults at Him, shaking their heads",
  "40": "and saying, \"The One who would demolish the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!\"",
  "41": "In the same way the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked Him and said,",
  "42": "\"He saved others, but He cannot save Himself! He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.",
  "43": "He has put His trust in God; let God rescue Him now-- if He wants Him! For He said, 'I am God's Son.'\"",
  "44": "In the same way even the criminals who were crucified with Him kept taunting Him.",
  "45": "From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over the whole land.",
  "46": "At about three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, \" El�, El�, lem� sabachth�ni? \" that is, \" My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\"",
  "47": "When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling for Elijah!\"",
  "48": "Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, fixed it on a reed, and offered Him a drink.",
  "49": "But the rest said, \"Let's see if Elijah comes to save Him!\"",
  "50": "Jesus shouted again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.",
  "51": "Suddenly, the curtain of the sanctuary was split in two from top to bottom; the earth quaked and the rocks were split.",
  "52": "The tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had gone to their rest were raised.",
  "53": "And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.",
  "54": "When the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified and said, \"This man really was God's Son!\"",
  "55": "Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to Him were there, looking on from a distance.",
  "56": "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.",
  "57": "When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.",
  "58": "He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that it be released.",
  "59": "So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean, fine linen,",
  "60": "and placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut into the rock. He left after rolling a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.",
  "61": "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were seated there, facing the tomb.",
  "62": "The next day, which followed the preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate",
  "63": "and said, \"Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive, He said, 'After three days I will rise again.'",
  "64": "Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come, steal Him, and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' Then the last deception will be worse than the first.\"",
  "65": "\"You have a guard [of soldiers],\" Pilate told them. \"Go and make it as secure as you know how.\"",
  "66": "Then they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting the guard."
