  "4": "An evil and adulterous generation wants a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\" Then He left them and went away.",
  "5": "The disciples reached the other shore, and they had forgotten to take bread.",
  "6": "Then Jesus told them, \"Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\"",
  "7": "And they discussed among themselves, \"We didn't bring any bread.\"",
  "8": "Aware of this, Jesus said, \"You of little faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves that you do not have bread?",
  "9": "Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected?",
  "10": "Or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many large baskets you collected?",
  "11": "Why is it you don't understand that when I told you, 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' it wasn't about bread?\"",
  "12": "Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the yeast in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
  "13": "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\"",
