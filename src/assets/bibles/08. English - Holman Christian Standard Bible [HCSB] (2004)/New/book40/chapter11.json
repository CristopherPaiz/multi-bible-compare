  "7": "As these men went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?",

  "23": "And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.",
