  "3": "Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;",
  "4": "Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.",
  "5": "Jesus sent out these 12 after giving them instructions: \"Don't take the road leading to other nations, and don't enter any Samaritan town.",
  "6": "Instead, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.",
  "7": "As you go, announce this: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'",
  "8": "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with skin diseases, drive out demons. You have received free of charge; give free of charge.",
  "9": "Don't take along gold, silver, or copper for your money-belts.",

  "12": "Greet a household when you enter it,",
  "13": "and if the household is worthy, let your peace be on it. But if it is unworthy, let your peace return to you.",
  "14": "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.",
  "15": "I assure you: It will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.",
  "16": "\"Look, I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as serpents and as harmless as doves.",
  "17": "Because people will hand you over to sanhedrins and flog you in their synagogues, beware of them.",
  "18": "You will even be brought before governors and kings because of Me, to bear witness to them and to the nations.",
  "19": "But when they hand you over, don't worry about how or what you should speak. For you will be given what to say at that hour,",

  "24": "A disciple is not above his teacher, or a slave above his master.",
  "25": "It is enough for a disciple to become like his teacher and a slave like his master. If they called the head of the house ' Beelzebul,' how much more the members of his household!",
  "26": "\"Therefore, don't be afraid of them, since there is nothing covered that won't be uncovered, and nothing hidden that won't be made known.",
  "27": "What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What you hear in a whisper, proclaim on the housetops.",

  "33": "But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.",
  "34": "Don't assume that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.",
  "35": "For I came to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;",
  "36": "and a man's enemies will be the members of his household.",
  "37": "The person who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; the person who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.",
  "38": "And whoever doesn't take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.",
  "39": "Anyone finding his life will lose it, and anyone losing his life because of Me will find it.",
  "40": "\"The one who welcomes you welcomes Me, and the one who welcomes Me welcomes Him who sent Me.",
  "41": "Anyone who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And anyone who welcomes a righteous person because he's righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.",
  "42": "And whoever gives just a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple-- I assure you: He will never lose his reward!\""
