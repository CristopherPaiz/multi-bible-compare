  "4": "since John had been telling him, \"It's not lawful for you to have her!\"",
  "5": "Though he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, since they regarded him as a prophet.",

  "7": "So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.",
  "8": "And prompted by her mother, she answered, \"Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter!\"",
  "9": "Although the king regretted it, he commanded that it be granted because of his oaths and his guests.",
  "10": "So he sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison.",
  "11": "His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.",
  "12": "Then his disciples came, removed the corpse, buried it, and went and reported to Jesus.",
  "13": "When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by boat to a remote place to be alone. When the crowds heard this, they followed Him on foot from the towns.",
  "14": "As He stepped ashore, He saw a huge crowd, felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.",
  "15": "When evening came, the disciples approached Him and said, \"This place is a wilderness, and it is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\"",
  "16": "\"They don't need to go away,\" Jesus told them. \"You give them something to eat.\"",
  "17": "\"But we only have five loaves and two fish here,\" they said to Him.",
  "18": "\"Bring them here to Me,\" He said.",
  "19": "Then He commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.",
  "20": "Everyone ate and was filled. Then they picked up 12 baskets full of leftover pieces!",
  "21": "Now those who ate were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.",
  "22": "Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.",
  "23": "After dismissing the crowds, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.",
  "24": "But the boat was already over a mile from land, battered by the waves, because the wind was against them.",
  "25": "Around three in the morning, He came toward them walking on the sea.",
  "26": "When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. \"It's a ghost!\" they said, and cried out in fear.",
  "27": "Immediately Jesus spoke to them. \"Have courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\"",
  "28": "\"Lord, if it's You,\" Peter answered Him, \"command me to come to You on the water.\"",
  "29": "\"Come!\" He said. And climbing out of the boat, Peter started walking on the water and came toward Jesus.",
  "30": "But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink he cried out, \"Lord, save me!\"",
  "31": "Immediately Jesus reached out His hand, caught hold of him, and said to him, \"You of little faith, why did you doubt?\"",
  "32": "When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.",
  "33": "Then those in the boat worshiped Him and said, \"Truly You are the Son of God!\"",
  "34": "Once they crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.",
  "35": "When the men of that place recognized Him, they alerted the whole vicinity and brought to Him all who were sick.",
