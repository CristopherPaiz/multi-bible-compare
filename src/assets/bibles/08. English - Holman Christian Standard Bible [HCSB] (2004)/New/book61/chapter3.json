  "1": "Dear friends, this is now the second letter I've written you; in both, I awaken your pure understanding with a reminder,",
  "2": "so that you can remember the words previously spoken by the holy prophets, and the commandment of our Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles.",
  "3": "First, be aware of this: scoffers will come in the last days to scoff, following their own lusts,",
  "4": "saying, \"Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they have been since the beginning of creation.\"",
  "5": "They willfully ignore this: long ago the heavens and the earth existed out of water and through water by the word of God.",
  "6": "Through these the world of that time perished when it was flooded by water.",
  "7": "But by the same word the present heavens and earth are held in store for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.",
  "8": "Dear friends, don't let this one thing escape you: with the Lord one day is like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years like one day.",
  "9": "The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.",
  "10": "But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief; on that [day] the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed.",
  "11": "Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, [it is clear] what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness",
  "12": "as you wait for and earnestly desire the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be on fire and be dissolved, and the elements will melt with the heat.",
  "13": "But based on His promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell.",
  "14": "Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found in peace without spot or blemish before Him.",
  "15": "Also, regard the patience of our Lord as [an opportunity for] salvation, just as our dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you.",
  "16": "He speaks about these things in all his letters, in which there are some matters that are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable twist them to their own destruction, as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures.",
  "17": "Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard, so that you are not led away by the error of the immoral and fall from your own stability.",
  "18": "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen."
