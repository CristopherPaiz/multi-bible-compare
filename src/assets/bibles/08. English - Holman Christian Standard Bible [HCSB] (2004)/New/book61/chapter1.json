  "1": "Simeon Peter, a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ: To those who have obtained a faith of equal privilege with ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.",
  "2": "May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.",
  "3": "For His divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness.",
  "4": "By these He has given us very great and precious promises, so that through them you may share in the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world because of evil desires.",
  "5": "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge,",
  "6": "knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness,",
  "7": "godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.",
  "8": "For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "9": "The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins.",
  "10": "Therefore, brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble.",
  "11": "For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you.",
  "12": "Therefore I will always remind you about these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you have.",
  "13": "I consider it right, as long as I am in this tent, to wake you up with a reminder,",
  "14": "knowing that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has also shown me.",
  "15": "And I will also make every effort that after my departure you may be able to recall these things at any time.",
  "16": "For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.",
  "17": "For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory: This is My beloved Son. I take delight in Him!",
  "18": "And we heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain.",
  "19": "So we have the prophetic word strongly confirmed. You will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dismal place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.",
  "20": "First of all, you should know this: no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation,",
  "21": "because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, moved by the Holy Spirit, men spoke from God."
