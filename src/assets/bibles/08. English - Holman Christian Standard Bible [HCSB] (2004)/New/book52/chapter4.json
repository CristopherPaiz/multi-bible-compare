  "1": "Finally then, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us how you must walk and please God-- as you are doing-- do so even more.",
  "2": "For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.",
  "3": "For this is God's will, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality,",
  "4": "so that each of you knows how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,",
  "5": "not with lustful desires, like the Gentiles who don't know God.",
  "6": "This means one must not transgress against and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all these offenses, as we also previously told and warned you.",
  "7": "For God has not called us to impurity, but to sanctification.",
  "8": "Therefore, the person who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who also gives you His Holy Spirit.",

  "15": "For we say this to you by a revelation from the Lord: We who are still alive at the Lord's coming will certainly have no advantage over those who have fallen asleep.",
  "16": "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel's voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.",
  "17": "Then we who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will always be with the Lord.",
  "18": "Therefore encourage one another with these words."
