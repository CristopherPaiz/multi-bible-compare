  "1": "For we know that if our earthly house, a tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
  "2": "And, in fact, we groan in this one, longing to put on our house from heaven,",
  "3": "since, when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.",
  "4": "Indeed, we who are in this tent groan, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life.",
  "5": "And the One who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.",
  "6": "Therefore, though we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord--",
  "7": "for we walk by faith, not by sight--",
  "8": "yet we are confident and satisfied to be out of the body and at home with the Lord.",
  "9": "Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him.",
  "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or bad.",
  "11": "Knowing, then, the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. We are completely open before God, and I hope we are completely open to your consciences as well.",
  "12": "We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who take pride in the outward appearance rather than in the heart.",
  "13": "For if we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we have a sound mind, it is for you.",
  "14": "For Christ's love compels us, since we have reached this conclusion: if One died for all, then all died.",
  "15": "And He died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the One who died for them and was raised.",
  "16": "From now on, then, we do not know anyone in a purely human way. Even if we have known Christ in a purely human way, yet now we no longer know Him like that.",
  "17": "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things have come.",
  "18": "Now everything is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:",
  "19": "that is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed the message of reconciliation to us.",
  "20": "Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ; certain that God is appealing through us, we plead on Christ's behalf, \"Be reconciled to God.\"",
  "21": "He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
