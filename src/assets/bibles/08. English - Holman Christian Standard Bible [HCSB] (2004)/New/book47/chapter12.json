  "1": "It is necessary to boast; it is not helpful, but I will move on to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
  "2": "I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven 14 years ago. Whether he was in the body or out of the body, I don't know; God knows.",
  "3": "I know that this man-- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows--",
  "4": "was caught up into paradise. He heard inexpressible words, which a man is not allowed to speak.",
  "5": "I will boast about this person, but not about myself, except of my weaknesses.",
  "6": "For if I want to boast, I will not be a fool, because I will be telling the truth. But I will spare you, so that no one can credit me with something beyond what he sees in me or hears from me,",
  "7": "especially because of the extraordinary revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me so I would not exalt myself.",
  "8": "Concerning this, I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me.",
  "9": "But He said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.\" Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may reside in me.",
  "10": "So because of Christ, I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in catastrophes, in persecutions, and in pressures. For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
  "11": "I have become a fool; you forced it on me. I ought to have been recommended by you, since I am in no way inferior to the \"super-apostles,\" even though I am nothing.",
  "12": "The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all endurance-- not only signs but also wonders and miracles.",
  "13": "So in what way were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I personally did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!",
  "14": "Look! I am ready to come to you this third time. I will not burden you, for I am not seeking what is yours, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.",
  "15": "I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?",
  "16": "Now granted, I have not burdened you; yet sly as I am, I took you in by deceit!",
  "17": "Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent you?",
  "18": "I urged Titus [to come], and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we walk in the same spirit and in the same footsteps?",
  "19": "You have thought all along that we were defending ourselves to you. [No], in the sight of God we are speaking in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is for building you up.",
  "20": "For I fear that perhaps when I come I will not find you to be what I want, and I may not be found by you to be what you want; there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.",
  "21": "I fear that when I come my God will again humiliate me in your presence, and I will grieve for many who sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and promiscuity they practiced."
