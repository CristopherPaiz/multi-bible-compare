  "3": "But I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may be corrupted from a complete and pure devotion to Christ.",
  "4": "For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you had not received, or a different gospel, which you had not accepted, you put up with it splendidly!",
  "5": "Now I consider myself in no way inferior to the \"super-apostles.\"",

  "16": "I repeat: no one should consider me a fool. But if [you do], at least accept me as a fool, so I too may boast a little.",
