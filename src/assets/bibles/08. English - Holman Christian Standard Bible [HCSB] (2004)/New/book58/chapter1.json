  "1": "Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways.",
  "2": "In these last days, He has spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things and through whom He made the universe.",
  "3": "He is the radiance of His glory, the exact expression of His nature, and He sustains all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.",
  "4": "So He became higher in rank than the angels, just as the name He inherited is superior to theirs.",
  "5": "For to which of the angels did He ever say, You are My Son; today I have become Your Father, or again, I will be His Father, and He will be My Son?",
  "6": "When He again brings His firstborn into the world, He says, And all God's angels must worship Him.",
  "7": "And about the angels He says: He makes His angels winds, and His servants a fiery flame;",
  "8": "but about the Son: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.",
  "9": "You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; this is why God, Your God, has anointed You, rather than Your companions, with the oil of joy.",
  "10": "And: In the beginning, Lord, You established the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands;",
  "11": "they will perish, but You remain. They will all wear out like clothing;",
  "12": "You will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like a robe. But You are the same, and Your years will never end.",
  "13": "Now to which of the angels has He ever said: Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?",
  "14": "Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?"
