  "11": "And each person will not teach his fellow citizen, and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them.",
  "12": "For I will be merciful to their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins.\"",
  "13": "By saying, a new [ covenant], He has declared that the first is old. And what is old and aging is about to disappear."
