  "1": "Therefore, while the promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear so that none of you should miss it.",
  "2": "For we also have received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith",
  "3": "(for we who have believed enter the rest), in keeping with what He has said: So I swore in My anger, they will not enter My rest. And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world,",
  "4": "for somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way: And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.",
  "5": "Again, in that passage [He says], They will never enter My rest.",
  "6": "Since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience,",
  "7": "again, He specifies a certain day-- today-- speaking through David after such a long time, as previously stated: Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.",
  "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken later about another day.",
  "9": "A Sabbath rest remains, therefore, for God's people.",

  "11": "Let us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.",
  "12": "For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating as far as to divide soul, spirit, joints, and marrow; it is a judge of the ideas and thoughts of the heart.",
  "13": "No creature is hidden from Him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account.",
  "14": "Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens-- Jesus the Son of God-- let us hold fast to the confession.",
  "15": "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin.",
  "16": "Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time."
