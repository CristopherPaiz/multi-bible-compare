  "2": "and requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, either men or women, he might bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.",
  "3": "As he traveled and was nearing Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.",
  "4": "Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?\"",

  "7": "The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the sound but seeing no one.",

  "11": "\"Get up and go to the street called Straight,\" the Lord said to him, \"to the house of Judas, and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, since he is praying there.",
  "12": "In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him so he may regain his sight.\"",
  "13": "\"Lord,\" Ananias answered, \"I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.",
  "14": "And he has authority here from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name.\"",

  "16": "I will certainly show him how much he must suffer for My name!\"",

  "18": "At once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized.",
  "19": "And after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.",
  "20": "Immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: \"He is the Son of God.\"",
  "21": "But all who heard him were astounded and said, \"Isn't this the man who, in Jerusalem, was destroying those who called on this name, and then came here for the purpose of taking them as prisoners to the chief priests?\"",
  "22": "But Saul grew more capable, and kept confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this One is the Messiah.",
  "23": "After many days had passed, the Jews conspired to kill him,",
  "24": "but their plot became known to Saul. So they were watching the gates day and night intending to kill him,",

  "26": "When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, since they did not believe he was a disciple.",
  "27": "Barnabas, however, took him and brought him to the apostles and explained to them how, on the road, Saul had seen the Lord, and that He had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.",
  "28": "Saul was coming and going with them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.",
  "29": "He conversed and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they attempted to kill him.",
  "30": "When the brothers found out, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.",
  "31": "So the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace, being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, and it increased in numbers.",

  "38": "Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him who begged him, \"Don't delay in coming with us.\"",
  "39": "So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they led him to the room upstairs. And all the widows approached him, weeping and showing him the robes and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was with them.",
  "40": "Then Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down, prayed, and turning toward the body said, \"Tabitha, get up!\" She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up.",
  "41": "He gave her his hand and helped her stand up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive.",
