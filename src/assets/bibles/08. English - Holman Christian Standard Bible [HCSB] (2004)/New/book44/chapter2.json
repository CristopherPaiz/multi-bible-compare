  "1": "When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place.",
  "2": "Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying.",
  "3": "And tongues, like flames of fire that were divided, appeared to them and rested on each one of them.",
  "4": "Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different languages, as the Spirit gave them ability for speech.",
  "5": "There were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.",
  "6": "When this sound occurred, the multitude came together and was confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language.",
  "7": "And they were astounded and amazed, saying, \"Look, aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?",
  "8": "How is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?",
  "9": "Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,",
  "10": "Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,",
  "11": "Cretans and Arabs-- we hear them speaking in our own languages the magnificent acts of God.\"",
  "12": "And they were all astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, \"What could this be?\"",
  "13": "But some sneered and said, \"They're full of new wine!\"",
  "14": "But Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them: \"Jewish men and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and pay attention to my words.",
  "15": "For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it's only nine in the morning.",
  "16": "On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:",
  "17": "And it will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.",
  "18": "I will even pour out My Spirit on My male and female slaves in those days, and they will prophesy.",
  "19": "I will display wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below: blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.",
  "20": "The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes;",
  "21": "then whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.",
  "22": "\"Men of Israel, listen to these words: This Jesus the Nazarene was a man pointed out to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through Him, just as you yourselves know.",
  "23": "Though He was delivered up according to God's determined plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail Him to a cross and kill Him.",
  "24": "God raised Him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.",
  "25": "For David says of Him: I saw the Lord ever before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.",
  "26": "Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh will rest in hope,",
  "27": "because You will not leave my soul in Hades, or allow Your Holy One to see decay.",
  "28": "You have revealed the paths of life to me; You will fill me with gladness in Your presence.",
  "29": "\"Brothers, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.",
  "30": "Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne.",
  "31": "Seeing this in advance, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah: He was not left in Hades, and His flesh did not experience decay.",
  "32": "\"God has resurrected this Jesus. We are all witnesses of this.",
  "33": "Therefore, since He has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, He has poured out what you both see and hear.",
  "34": "For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says: The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand",
  "35": "until I make Your enemies Your footstool.'",
  "36": "\"Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah!\"",
  "37": "When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: \"Brothers, what must we do?\"",
  "38": "\"Repent,\" Peter said to them, \"and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
  "39": "For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call.\"",
  "40": "And with many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, \"Be saved from this corrupt generation!\"",
  "41": "So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 people were added to them.",
  "42": "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayers.",
  "43": "Then fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles.",
  "44": "Now all the believers were together and had everything in common.",
  "45": "So they sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as anyone had a need.",
  "46": "And every day they devoted themselves [to meeting] together in the temple complex, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,",
  "47": "praising God and having favor with all the people. And every day the Lord added to them those who were being saved."
