  "4": "I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women in jail,",
  "5": "as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. Having received letters from them to the brothers, I was traveling to Damascus to bring those who were prisoners there to be punished in Jerusalem.",
  "6": "\"As I was traveling and near Damascus, about noon an intense light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.",

  "9": "Now those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me.",
  "10": "\"Then I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' \"And the Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything that is assigned for you to do.'",

  "14": "Then he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of His voice.",
  "15": "For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard.",
  "16": "And now, why delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins by calling on His name.'",
  "17": "\"After I came back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple complex, I went into a visionary state",
  "18": "and saw Him telling me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me!'",
  "19": "\"But I said, 'Lord, they know that in synagogue after synagogue I had those who believed in You imprisoned and beaten.",
  "20": "And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving, and I guarded the clothes of those who killed him.'",
