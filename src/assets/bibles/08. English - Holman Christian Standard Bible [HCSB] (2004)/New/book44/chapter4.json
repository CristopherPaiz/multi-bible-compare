  "1": "Now as they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guard, and the Sadducees confronted them,",
  "2": "because they were provoked that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the person of Jesus the resurrection from the dead.",
  "3": "So they seized them and put them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.",
  "4": "But many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to about 5,000.",
  "5": "The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem",
  "6": "with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John and Alexander, and all the members of the high-priestly family.",
  "7": "After they had Peter and John stand before them, they asked the question: \"By what power or in what name have you done this?\"",
  "8": "Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said to them, \"Rulers of the people and elders:",
  "9": "If we are being examined today about a good deed done to a disabled man-- by what means he was healed--",
  "10": "let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene-- whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead-- by Him this man is standing here before you healthy.",
  "11": "This [Jesus] is The stone despised by you builders, who has become the cornerstone.",
  "12": "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved.\"",
  "13": "When they observed the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed and knew that they had been with Jesus.",
  "14": "And since they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in response.",
  "15": "After they had ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,",
  "16": "saying, \"What should we do with these men? For an obvious sign, evident to all who live in Jerusalem, has been done through them, and we cannot deny it!",
  "17": "But so this does not spread any further among the people, let's threaten them against speaking to anyone in this name again.\"",
  "18": "So they called for them and ordered them not to preach or teach at all in the name of Jesus.",
  "19": "But Peter and John answered them, \"Whether it's right in the sight of God [for us] to listen to you rather than to God, you decide;",
  "20": "for we are unable to stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.\"",
  "21": "After threatening them further, they released them. They found no way to punish them, because the people were all giving glory to God over what had been done;",
  "22": "for the man was over 40 years old on whom this sign of healing had been performed.",
  "23": "After they were released, they went to their own fellowship and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.",
  "24": "When they heard this, they raised their voices to God unanimously and said, \"Master, You are the One who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and everything in them.",
  "25": "You said through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David Your servant: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot futile things?",
  "26": "The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers assembled together against the Lord and against His Messiah.",
  "27": "\"For, in fact, in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed,",
  "28": "to do whatever Your hand and Your plan had predestined to take place.",
  "29": "And now, Lord, consider their threats, and grant that Your slaves may speak Your message with complete boldness,",
  "30": "while You stretch out Your hand for healing, signs, and wonders to be performed through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.\"",
  "31": "When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak God's message with boldness.",
  "32": "Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own, but instead they held everything in common.",
  "33": "And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on all of them.",
  "34": "For there was not a needy person among them, because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,",
  "35": "and laid them at the apostles' feet. This was then distributed to each person as anyone had a need.",
  "36": "Joseph, a Levite and a Cypriot by birth, whom the apostles named Barnabas, which is translated Son of Encouragement,",
  "37": "sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
