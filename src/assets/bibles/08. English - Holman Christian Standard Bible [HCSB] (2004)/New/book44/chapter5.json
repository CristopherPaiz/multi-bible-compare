  "1": "But a man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property.",
  "2": "However, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife's knowledge, and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.",
  "3": "Then Peter said, \"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds from the field?",
  "4": "Wasn't it yours while you possessed it? And after it was sold, wasn't it at your disposal? Why is it that you planned this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God!\"",
  "5": "When he heard these words, Ananias dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard.",
  "6": "The young men got up, wrapped [his body], carried him out, and buried him.",
  "7": "There was an interval of about three hours; then his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.",
  "8": "\"Tell me,\" Peter asked her, \"did you sell the field for this price?\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"for that price.\"",
  "9": "Then Peter said to her, \"Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!\"",
  "10": "Instantly she dropped dead at his feet. When the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.",
  "11": "Then great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard these things.",
  "12": "Many signs and wonders were being done among the people through the hands of the apostles. By common consent they would all meet in Solomon's Colonnade.",
  "13": "None of the rest dared to join them, but the people praised them highly.",
  "14": "Believers were added to the Lord in increasing numbers-- crowds of both men and women.",
  "15": "As a result, they would carry the sick out into the streets and lay them on beds and pallets so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.",
  "16": "In addition, a multitude came together from the towns surrounding Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.",
  "17": "Then the high priest took action. He and all his colleagues, those who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.",
  "18": "So they arrested the apostles and put them in the city jail.",
  "19": "But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail during the night, brought them out, and said,",
  "20": "\"Go and stand in the temple complex, and tell the people all about this life.\"",
  "21": "In obedience to this, they entered the temple complex at daybreak and began to teach. When the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin-- the full Senate of the sons of Israel-- and sent [orders] to the jail to have them brought.",
  "22": "But when the temple police got there, they did not find them in the jail, so they returned and reported,",
  "23": "\"We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing in front of the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!\"",
  "24": "As the captain of the temple police and the chief priests heard these things, they were baffled about them, as to what could come of this.",
  "25": "Someone came and reported to them, \"Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple complex and teaching the people.\"",
  "26": "Then the captain went with the temple police and brought them in without force, because they were afraid the people might stone them.",
  "27": "When they had brought them in, they had them stand before the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked,",
  "28": "\"Didn't we strictly order you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!\"",
  "29": "But Peter and the apostles replied, \"We must obey God rather than men.",
  "30": "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had murdered by hanging Him on a tree.",
  "31": "God exalted this man to His right hand as ruler and Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.",
  "32": "We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.\"",
  "33": "When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.",
  "34": "A Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.",
  "35": "He said to them, \"Men of Israel, be careful about what you're going to do to these men.",
  "36": "Not long ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about 400 men rallied to him. He was killed, and all his partisans were dispersed and came to nothing.",
  "37": "After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and attracted a following. That man also perished, and all his partisans were scattered.",
  "38": "And now, I tell you, stay away from these men and leave them alone. For if this plan or this work is of men, it will be overthrown;",
  "39": "but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even be found fighting against God.\" So they were persuaded by him.",
  "40": "After they called in the apostles and had them flogged, they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them.",
  "41": "Then they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name.",
  "42": "Every day in the temple complex, and in various homes, they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that the Messiah is Jesus."
