  "14": "Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray over him after anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord.",
  "15": "The prayer of faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.",
  "16": "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The intense prayer of the righteous is very powerful.",
