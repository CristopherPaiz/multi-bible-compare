  "1": "My brothers, hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ without showing favoritism.",
  "2": "For suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring, dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man dressed in dirty clothes also comes in.",
  "3": "If you look with favor on the man wearing the fine clothes so that you say, \"Sit here in a good place,\" and yet you say to the poor man, \"Stand over there,\" or, \"Sit here on the floor by my footstool,\"",
  "4": "haven't you discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?",
  "5": "Listen, my dear brothers: Didn't God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him?",
  "6": "Yet you dishonored that poor man. Don't the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?",
  "7": "Don't they blaspheme the noble name that you bear?",
  "8": "If you really carry out the royal law prescribed in Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.",
  "9": "But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.",
  "10": "For whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is guilty of [breaking it] all.",
  "11": "For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you are a lawbreaker.",
  "12": "Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom.",
  "13": "For judgment is without mercy to the one who hasn't shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.",
  "14": "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but does not have works? Can his faith save him?",
  "15": "If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food,",
  "16": "and one of you says to them, \"Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,\" but you don't give them what the body needs, what good is it?",
  "17": "In the same way faith, if it doesn't have works, is dead by itself.",
  "18": "But someone will say, \"You have faith, and I have works.\" Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith from my works.",
  "19": "You believe that God is one; you do well. The demons also believe-- and they shudder.",
  "20": "Foolish man! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless?",
  "21": "Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?",
  "22": "You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was perfected.",
  "23": "So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, and he was called God's friend.",
  "24": "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.",
  "25": "And in the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by a different route?",
  "26": "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
