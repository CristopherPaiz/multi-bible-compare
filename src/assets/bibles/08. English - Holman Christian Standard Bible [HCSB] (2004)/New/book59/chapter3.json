  "1": "Not many should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive a stricter judgment;",
  "2": "for we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a mature man who is also able to control his whole body.",
  "3": "Now when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide the whole animal.",
  "4": "And consider ships: though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.",
  "5": "So too, though the tongue is a small part [of the body], it boasts great things. Consider how large a forest a small fire ignites.",
  "6": "And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed among the parts of our [bodies]; it pollutes the whole body, sets the course of life on fire, and is set on fire by hell.",
  "7": "For every creature-- animal or bird, reptile or fish-- is tamed and has been tamed by man,",
  "8": "but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.",
  "9": "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in God's likeness.",
  "10": "Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things should not be this way.",
  "11": "Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening?",
  "12": "Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers, or a grapevine [produce] figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water.",
  "13": "Who is wise and understanding among you? He should show his works by good conduct with wisdom's gentleness.",
  "14": "But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't brag and lie in defiance of the truth.",
  "15": "Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.",
  "16": "For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil.",
  "17": "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without favoritism and hypocrisy.",
  "18": "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
