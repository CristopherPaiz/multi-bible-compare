  "1": "James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ: To the 12 tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings.",
  "2": "Consider it a great joy, my brothers, whenever you experience various trials,",
  "3": "knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.",
  "4": "But endurance must do its complete work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.",
  "5": "Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him.",
  "6": "But let him ask in faith without doubting. For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind.",
  "7": "That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.",
  "8": "An indecisive man is unstable in all his ways.",
  "9": "The brother of humble circumstances should boast in his exaltation;",
  "10": "but the one who is rich [should boast] in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a flower of the field.",
  "11": "For the sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will wither away while pursuing his activities.",
  "12": "Blessed is a man who endures trials, because when he passes the test he will receive the crown of life that He has promised to those who love Him.",
  "13": "No one undergoing a trial should say, \"I am being tempted by God.\" For God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself doesn't tempt anyone.",
  "14": "But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires.",
  "15": "Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.",
  "16": "Don't be deceived, my dearly loved brothers.",
  "17": "Every generous act and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights; with Him there is no variation or shadow cast by turning.",
  "18": "By His own choice, He gave us a new birth by the message of truth so that we would be the firstfruits of His creatures.",
  "19": "My dearly loved brothers, understand this: everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,",
  "20": "for man's anger does not accomplish God's righteousness.",
  "21": "Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and evil excess, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save you.",
  "22": "But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.",
  "23": "Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror;",
  "24": "for he looks at himself, goes away, and right away forgets what kind of man he was.",
  "25": "But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts-- this person will be blessed in what he does.",
  "26": "If anyone thinks he is religious, without controlling his tongue but deceiving his heart, his religion is useless.",
  "27": "Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
