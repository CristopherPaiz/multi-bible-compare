  "1": "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea existed no longer.",
  "2": "I also saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.",
  "3": "Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look! God's dwelling is with men, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.",
  "4": "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will exist no longer; grief, crying, and pain will exist no longer, because the previous things have passed away.",
  "5": "Then the One seated on the throne said, \"Look! I am making everything new.\" He also said, \"Write, because these words are faithful and true.\"",
  "6": "And He said to me, \"It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to the thirsty from the spring of living water as a gift.",
  "7": "The victor will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.",
  "8": "But the cowards, unbelievers, vile, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars-- their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.\"",
  "9": "Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\"",
  "10": "He then carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,",
  "11": "arrayed with God's glory. Her radiance was like a very precious stone, like a jasper stone, bright as crystal.",
  "12": "[The city] had a massive high wall, with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; [on the gates], names were inscribed, the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.",
  "13": "There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.",
  "14": "The city wall had 12 foundations, and on them were the 12 names of the Lamb's 12 apostles.",
  "15": "The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.",
  "16": "The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 stadia. Its length, width, and height are equal.",
  "17": "Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used.",
  "18": "The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.",
  "19": "The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,",
  "20": "the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.",
  "21": "The 12 gates are 12 pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The broad street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.",
  "22": "I did not see a sanctuary in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its sanctuary.",
  "23": "The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because God's glory illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.",
  "24": "The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.",
  "25": "Each day its gates will never close because it will never be night there.",
  "26": "They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.",
  "27": "Nothing profane will ever enter it: no one who does what is vile or false, but only those written in the Lamb's book of life."
