  "1": "One Sabbath, when He went to eat at the house of one of the leading Pharisees, they were watching Him closely.",
  "2": "There in front of Him was a man whose body was swollen with fluid.",
  "3": "In response, Jesus asked the law experts and the Pharisees, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?\"",
  "4": "But they kept silent. He took the man, healed him, and sent him away.",
  "5": "And to them, He said, \"Which of you whose son or ox falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?\"",
  "6": "To this they could find no answer.",
  "7": "He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noticed how they would choose the best places for themselves:",
  "8": "\"When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, don't recline at the best place, because a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by your host.",
  "9": "The one who invited both of you may come and say to you, 'Give your place to this man,' and then in humiliation, you will proceed to take the lowest place.",
  "10": "\"But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' You will then be honored in the presence of all the other guests.",
  "11": "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\"",
  "12": "He also said to the one who had invited Him, \"When you give a lunch or a dinner, don't invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your rich neighbors, because they might invite you back, and you would be repaid.",
  "13": "On the contrary, when you host a banquet, invite those who are poor, maimed, lame, or blind.",
  "14": "And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\"",
  "15": "When one of those who reclined at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, \"The one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God is blessed!\"",
  "16": "Then He told him: \"A man was giving a large banquet and invited many.",
  "17": "At the time of the banquet, he sent his slave to tell those who were invited, 'Come, because everything is now ready.'",
  "18": "\"But without exception they all began to make excuses. The first one said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to excuse me.'",
  "19": "\"Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm going to try them out. I ask you to excuse me.'",
  "20": "\"And another said, 'I just got married, and therefore I'm unable to come.'",
  "21": "\"So the slave came back and reported these things to his master. Then in anger, the master of the house told his slave, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in here the poor, maimed, blind, and lame!'",
  "22": "\" 'Master,' the slave said, 'what you ordered has been done, and there's still room.'",
  "23": "\"Then the master told the slave, 'Go out into the highways and lanes and make them come in, so that my house may be filled.",
  "24": "For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will enjoy my banquet!'\"",
  "25": "Now great crowds were traveling with Him. So He turned and said to them:",
  "26": "\"If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters-- yes, and even his own life-- he cannot be My disciple.",
  "27": "Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.",
  "28": "\"For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?",
  "29": "Otherwise, after he has laid the foundation and cannot finish it, all the onlookers will begin to make fun of him,",
  "30": "saying, 'This man started to build and wasn't able to finish.'",
  "31": "\"Or what king, going to war against another king, will not first sit down and decide if he is able with 10,000 to oppose the one who comes against him with 20,000?",
  "32": "If not, while the other is still far off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.",
  "33": "In the same way, therefore, every one of you who does not say good-bye to all his possessions cannot be My disciple.",
  "34": "\"Now, salt is good, but if salt should lose its taste, how will it be made salty?",
  "35": "It isn't fit for the soil or for the manure pile; they throw it out. Anyone who has ears to hear should listen!\""
