  "1": "On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.",
  "2": "They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.",
  "3": "They went in but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
  "4": "While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood by them in dazzling clothes.",
  "5": "So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground. \"Why are you looking for the living among the dead?\" asked the men.",
  "6": "\"He is not here, but He has been resurrected! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,",
  "7": "saying, 'The Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day'?\"",
  "8": "And they remembered His words.",
  "9": "Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest.",
  "10": "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them were telling the apostles these things.",
  "11": "But these words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.",
  "12": "Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. When he stooped to look in, he saw only the linen cloths. So he went home, amazed at what had happened.",
  "13": "Now that same day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.",
  "14": "Together they were discussing everything that had taken place.",
  "15": "And while they were discussing and arguing, Jesus Himself came near and began to walk along with them.",
  "16": "But they were prevented from recognizing Him.",
  "17": "Then He asked them, \"What is this dispute that you're having with each other as you are walking?\" And they stopped [walking and looked] discouraged.",
  "18": "The one named Cleopas answered Him, \"Are You the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things that happened there in these days?\"",
  "19": "\"What things?\" He asked them. So they said to Him, \"The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in action and speech before God and all the people,",
  "20": "and how our chief priests and leaders handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified Him.",
  "21": "But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, it's the third day since these things happened.",
  "22": "Moreover, some women from our group astounded us. They arrived early at the tomb,",
  "23": "and when they didn't find His body, they came and reported that they had seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.",
  "24": "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see Him.\"",
  "25": "He said to them, \"How unwise and slow you are to believe in your hearts all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "26": "Didn't the Messiah have to suffer these things and enter into His glory?\"",
  "27": "Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He interpreted for them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.",
  "28": "They came near the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther.",
  "29": "But they urged Him: \"Stay with us, because it's almost evening, and now the day is almost over.\" So He went in to stay with them.",
  "30": "It was as He reclined at the table with them that He took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.",
  "31": "Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him, but He disappeared from their sight.",
  "32": "So they said to each other, \"Weren't our hearts ablaze within us while He was talking with us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us?\"",
  "33": "That very hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the Eleven and those with them gathered together,",
  "34": "who said, \"The Lord has certainly been raised, and has appeared to Simon!\"",
  "35": "Then they began to describe what had happened on the road and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.",
  "36": "And as they were saying these things, He Himself stood among them. He said to them, \"Peace to you!\"",
  "37": "But they were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost.",
  "38": "\"Why are you troubled?\" He asked them. \"And why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
  "39": "Look at My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself! Touch Me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have.\"",
  "40": "Having said this, He showed them His hands and feet.",
  "41": "But while they still could not believe because of [their] joy and were amazed, He asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\"",
  "42": "So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish,",
  "43": "and He took it and ate in their presence.",
  "44": "Then He told them, \"These are My words that I spoke to you while I was still with you-- that everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\"",
  "45": "Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.",
  "46": "He also said to them, \"This is what is written: the Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead the third day,",
  "47": "and repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.",
  "48": "You are witnesses of these things.",
  "49": "And look, I am sending you what My Father promised. As for you, stay in the city until you are empowered from on high.\"",
  "50": "Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands He blessed them.",
  "51": "And while He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.",
  "52": "After worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.",
  "53": "And they were continually in the temple complex blessing God."
