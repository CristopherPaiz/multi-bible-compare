  "6": "So he quickly came down and welcomed Him joyfully.",
  "7": "All who saw it began to complain, \"He's gone to lodge with a sinful man!\"",
  "8": "But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, \"Look, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor, Lord! And if I have extorted anything from anyone, I'll pay back four times as much!\"",
  "9": "\"Today salvation has come to this house,\" Jesus told him, \"because he too is a son of Abraham.",
  "10": "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.\"",
  "11": "As they were listening to this, He went on to tell a parable because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away.",
  "12": "Therefore He said: \"A nobleman traveled to a far country to receive for himself authority to be king and then return.",
  "13": "He called 10 of his slaves, gave them 10 minas, and told them, 'Engage in business until I come back.'",

  "18": "\"The second came and said, 'Master, your mina has made five minas.'",
  "19": "\"So he said to him, 'You will be over five towns.'",
  "20": "\"And another came and said, 'Master, here is your mina. I have kept it hidden away in a cloth",
  "21": "because I was afraid of you, for you're a tough man: you collect what you didn't deposit and reap what you didn't sow.'",
  "22": "\"He told him, 'I will judge you by what you have said, you evil slave! [If] you knew I was a tough man, collecting what I didn't deposit and reaping what I didn't sow,",
  "23": "why didn't you put my money in the bank? And when I returned, I would have collected it with interest!'",
  "24": "So he said to those standing there, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has 10 minas.'",
  "25": "\"But they said to him, 'Master, he has 10 minas.'",

  "31": "If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say this: 'The Lord needs it.'\"",
  "32": "So those who were sent left and found it just as He had told them.",
  "33": "As they were untying the young donkey, its owners said to them, \"Why are you untying the donkey?\"",
  "34": "\"The Lord needs it,\" they said.",
  "35": "Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their robes on the donkey, they helped Jesus get on it.",
