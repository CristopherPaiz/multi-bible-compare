  "1": "At that time, some people came and reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.",
  "2": "And He responded to them, \"Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all Galileans because they suffered these things?",
  "3": "No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!",
  "4": "Or those 18 that the tower in Siloam fell on and killed-- do you think they were more sinful than all the people who live in Jerusalem?",
  "5": "No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!\"",
  "6": "And He told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it and found none.",
  "7": "He told the vineyard worker, 'Listen, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it even waste the soil?'",
  "8": "\"But he replied to him, 'Sir, leave it this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.",
  "9": "Perhaps it will bear fruit next year, but if not, you can cut it down.'\"",
  "10": "As He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,",
  "11": "a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for over 18 years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.",
  "12": "When Jesus saw her, He called out to her, \"Woman, you are free of your disability.\"",
  "13": "Then He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was restored and began to glorify God.",
  "14": "But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded by telling the crowd, \"There are six days when work should be done; therefore come on those days and be healed and not on the Sabbath day.\"",
  "15": "But the Lord answered him and said, \"Hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you untie his ox or donkey from the feeding trough on the Sabbath, and lead it to water?",
  "16": "Satan has bound this woman, a daughter of Abraham, for 18 years-- shouldn't she be untied from this bondage on the Sabbath day?\"",
  "17": "When He had said these things, all His adversaries were humiliated, but the whole crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things He was doing.",
  "18": "He said therefore, \"What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?",
  "19": "It's like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.\"",
  "20": "Again He said, \"What can I compare the kingdom of God to?",
  "21": "It's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into 50 pounds of flour until it spread through the entire mixture.\"",
  "22": "He went through one town and village after another, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem.",
  "23": "\"Lord,\" someone asked Him, \"are there few being saved?\" He said to them,",
  "24": "\"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because I tell you, many will try to enter and won't be able",
  "25": "once the homeowner gets up and shuts the door. Then you will stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up for us!' He will answer you, 'I don't know you or where you're from.'",
  "26": "Then you will say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!'",
  "27": "But He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know you or where you're from. Get away from Me, all you workers of unrighteousness!'",
  "28": "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in that place, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but yourselves thrown out.",
  "29": "They will come from east and west, from north and south, and recline at the table in the kingdom of God.",
  "30": "Note this: some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.\"",
  "31": "At that time some Pharisees came and told Him, \"Go, get out of here! Herod wants to kill You!\"",
  "32": "He said to them, \"Go tell that fox, 'Look! I'm driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete My work.'",
  "33": "Yet I must travel today, tomorrow, and the next day, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem!",
  "34": "\"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!",
  "35": "See, your house is abandoned to you. And I tell you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!\""
