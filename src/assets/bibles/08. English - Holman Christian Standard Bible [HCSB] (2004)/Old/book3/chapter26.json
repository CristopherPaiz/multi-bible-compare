  "17": "I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even though no one is pursuing you.",
  "18": "\"But if after these things you will not obey Me, I will proceed to discipline you seven times for your sins.",
  "19": "I will break down your strong pride. I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,",

  "32": "I also will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to live there will be appalled by it.",
  "33": "But I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw a sword [to chase] after you. So your land will become desolate, and your cities will become ruins.",

  "41": "and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies-- and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled, and if they will pay the penalty for their sin,",
  "42": "then I will remember My covenant with Jacob. I will also remember My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.",
  "43": "For the land abandoned by them will make up for its Sabbaths by lying desolate without the people, while they pay the penalty for their sin, because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes.",
  "44": "Yet in spite of this, while they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or abhor them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them, since I am the LORD their God.",
