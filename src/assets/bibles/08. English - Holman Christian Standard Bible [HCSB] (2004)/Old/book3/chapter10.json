  "8": "The LORD spoke to Aaron:",
  "9": "\"You and your sons are not to drink wine or beer when you enter the tent of meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute throughout your generations.",

  "18": "Since its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary [area], as I commanded.\"",
  "19": "But Aaron replied to Moses, \"See, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the LORD's sight?\"",
