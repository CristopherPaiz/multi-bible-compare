  "1": "The LORD spoke to Moses:",
  "2": "\"Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When someone makes a special vow to the LORD that involves the valuation of people,",
  "3": "if the valuation concerns a male from 20 to 60 years old, your valuation is 50 silver shekels [measured] by the standard sanctuary shekel.",
  "4": "If the person is a female, your valuation is 30 shekels.",
  "5": "If the person is from five to 20 years old, your valuation for a male is 20 shekels and for a female 10 shekels.",
  "6": "If the person is from one month to five years old, your valuation for a male is five silver shekels, and for a female your valuation is three shekels of silver.",
  "7": "If the person is 60 years or more, your valuation is 15 shekels for a male and 10 shekels for a female.",
  "8": "But if one is too poor to pay the valuation, he must present the person before the priest and the priest will set a value for him. The priest will set a value for him according to what the one making the vow can afford.",
  "9": "\"If the vow involves one of the animals that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any of these he gives to the LORD will be holy.",
  "10": "He may not replace it or make a substitution for it, either good for bad, or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy.",
  "11": "\"If the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest.",
  "12": "The priest will set its value, whether high or low; the price will be set as the priest makes the valuation for you.",
  "13": "If the one who brought it decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the valuation.",
  "14": "\"When a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, the priest will assess its value, whether high or low. The price will stand just as the priest assesses it.",
  "15": "But if the one who consecrated his house redeems [it], he must add a fifth to the valuation price, and it will be his.",
  "16": "\"If a man consecrates to the LORD any part of a field that he possesses, your valuation will be proportional to the seed needed to sow it, at the rate of 50 silver shekels for [every] five bushels of barley seed.",
  "17": "If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation.",
  "18": "But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price for him in proportion to the years left until the [next] Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced.",
  "19": "If the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the valuation price, and the field will transfer back to him.",
  "20": "But if he does not redeem the field or if he has sold it to another man, it is no longer redeemable.",
  "21": "When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will be holy to the LORD like a field permanently set apart; it becomes the priest's property.",
  "22": "\"If a person consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased that is not part of his inherited landholding,",
  "23": "then the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up to the Year of Jubilee, and the person will pay the valuation on that day as a holy offering to the LORD.",
  "24": "In the Year of Jubilee the field will return to the one he bought it from, the original owner.",
  "25": "All your valuations will be [measured] by the standard sanctuary shekel, 20 gerahs to the shekel.",
  "26": "\"But no one can consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, whether an animal from the herd or flock, to the LORD, because a firstborn [already] belongs to the LORD.",
  "27": "If it is one of the unclean livestock, it must be ransomed according to your valuation by adding a fifth of its value to it. If it is not redeemed, it can be sold according to your valuation.",
  "28": "\"Nothing that a man permanently sets apart to the LORD from all he owns, whether a person, an animal, or his inherited landholding, can be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is especially holy to the LORD.",
  "29": "No person who has been set apart [for destruction] is to be ransomed; he must be put to death.",
  "30": "\"Every tenth of the land's produce, grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.",
  "31": "If a man decides to redeem any part of this tenth, he must add one-fifth to its value.",
  "32": "Every tenth animal from the herd or flock, which passes under the [shepherd's] rod, will be holy to the LORD.",
  "33": "He is not to inspect whether it is good or bad, and he is not to make a substitution for it. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute will be holy; they cannot be redeemed.\"",
  "34": "These are the commands the LORD gave Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai."
