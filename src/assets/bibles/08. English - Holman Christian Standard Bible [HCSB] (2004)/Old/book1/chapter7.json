  "11": "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the sources of the watery depths burst open, the floodgates of the sky were opened,",
  "12": "and the rain fell on the earth 40 days and 40 nights.",

  "22": "Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils-- everything on dry land died.",
  "23": "He wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the ground, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.",
  "24": "And the waters surged on the earth 150 days."
