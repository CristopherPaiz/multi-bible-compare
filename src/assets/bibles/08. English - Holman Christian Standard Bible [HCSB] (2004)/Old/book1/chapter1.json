  "16": "God made the two great lights-- the greater light to have dominion over the day and the lesser light to have dominion over the night-- as well as the stars.",
  "17": "God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth,",

  "23": "Evening came, and then morning: the fifth day.",
  "24": "Then God said, \"Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.\" And it was so.",
  "25": "So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.",
