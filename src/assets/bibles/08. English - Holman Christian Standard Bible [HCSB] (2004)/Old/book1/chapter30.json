  "5": "Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.",
  "6": "Rachel said, \"God has vindicated me; yes, He has heard me and given me a son,\" and she named him Dan.",

  "10": "Leah's slave Zilpah bore Jacob a son.",
  "11": "Then Leah said, \"What good fortune!\" and she named him Gad.",
  "12": "When Leah's slave Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,",
  "13": "Leah said, \"I am happy that the women call me happy,\" so she named him Asher.",
  "14": "Reuben went out during the wheat harvest and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother Leah, Rachel asked, \"Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.\"",
  "15": "But Leah replied to her, \"Isn't it enough that you have taken my husband? Now you also want to take my son's mandrakes?\" \"Well,\" Rachel said, \"you can sleep with him tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.\"",
  "16": "When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.\" So Jacob slept with her that night.",

  "23": "She conceived and bore a son, and said, \"God has taken away my shame.\"",
  "24": "She named him Joseph: \"May the LORD add another son to me.\"",
  "25": "After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \"Send me on my way so that I can return to my homeland.",
  "26": "Give me my wives and my children that I have worked for, and let me go. You know how hard I have worked for you.\"",

  "28": "Then Laban said, \"Name your wages, and I will pay them.\"",
  "29": "So Jacob said to him, \"You know what I have done for you and your herds.",
  "30": "For you had very little before I came, but now your wealth has increased. The LORD has blessed you because of me. And now, when will I also do something for my own family?\"",
  "31": "Laban asked, \"What should I give you?\" And Jacob said, \"You don't need to give me anything. If you do this one thing for me, I will continue to shepherd and keep your flock.",
  "32": "Let me go through all your sheep today and remove every sheep that is speckled or spotted, every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the female goats. [Such] will be my wages.",
  "33": "In the future when you come to check on my wages, my honesty will testify for me. [If I have] any female goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not black, they will be considered stolen.\"",
  "34": "\"Good,\" said Laban. \"Let it be as you have said.\"",
  "35": "That day Laban removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats-- every one that had any white on it-- and every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and he placed his sons in charge of them.",
  "36": "He put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob, meanwhile, was shepherding the rest of Laban's flock.",
  "37": "Jacob then took branches of fresh poplar, almond, and plane wood, and peeled [the bark], exposing white stripes on the branches.",
  "38": "He set the peeled branches in the troughs in front of the sheep-- in the water channels where the sheep came to drink. And the sheep bred when they came to drink.",
  "39": "The flocks bred in front of the branches and bore streaked, speckled, and spotted young.",
  "40": "Jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked and the completely dark sheep in Laban's flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and didn't put them with Laban's sheep.",
  "41": "Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the branches in the troughs, in full view of the flocks, and they would breed in front of the branches.",
  "42": "As for the weaklings of the flocks, he did not put out the branches. So it turned out that the weak sheep belonged to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.",
  "43": "And the man became very rich. He had many flocks, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys."
