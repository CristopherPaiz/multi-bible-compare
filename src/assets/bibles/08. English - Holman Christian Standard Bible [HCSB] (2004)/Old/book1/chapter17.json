  "1": "When Abram was 99 years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, \"I am God Almighty. Live in My presence and be devout.",
  "2": "I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you greatly.\"",
  "3": "Then Abram fell to the ground, and God spoke with him:",
  "4": "\"As for Me, My covenant is with you, and you will become the father of many nations.",
  "5": "Your name will no longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I will make you the father of many nations.",
  "6": "I will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you.",
  "7": "I will keep My covenant between Me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant to be your God and the [God] of your offspring after you.",
  "8": "And to you and your offspring after you I will give the land where you are residing-- all the land of Canaan-- as an eternal possession, and I will be their God.\"",
  "9": "God also said to Abraham, \"As for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep My covenant.",
  "10": "This is My covenant, which you are to keep, between Me and you and your offspring after you: Every one of your males must be circumcised.",
  "11": "You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and you.",
  "12": "Throughout your generations, every male among you at eight days old is to be circumcised. This includes a slave born in your house and one purchased with money from any foreigner. The one who is not your offspring,",
  "13": "a slave born in your house, as well as one purchased with money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.",
  "14": "If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.\"",
  "15": "God said to Abraham, \"As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai, for Sarah will be her name.",
  "16": "I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will produce nations; kings of peoples will come from her.\"",
  "17": "Abraham fell to the ground, laughed, and thought in his heart, \"Can a child be born to a hundred-year-old man? Can Sarah, a ninety-year-old woman, give birth?\"",
  "18": "So Abraham said to God, \"If only Ishmael could live in Your presence!\"",
  "19": "But God said, \"No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.",
  "20": "As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will certainly bless him; I will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly. He will father 12 tribal leaders, and I will make him into a great nation.",
  "21": "But I will confirm My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.\"",
  "22": "When He finished talking with him, God withdrew from Abraham.",
  "23": "Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or purchased with his money-- every male among the members of Abraham's household-- and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, just as God had said to him.",
  "24": "Abraham was 99 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised,",
  "25": "and his son Ishmael was 13 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.",
  "26": "On that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.",
  "27": "And all the men of his household-- both slaves born in his house and those purchased with money from a foreigner-- were circumcised with him."
