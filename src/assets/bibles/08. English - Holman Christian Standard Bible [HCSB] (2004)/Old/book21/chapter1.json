  "1": "The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.",
  "2": "\"Absolute futility,\" says the Teacher. \"Absolute futility. Everything is futile.\"",
  "3": "What does a man gain for all his efforts he labors at under the sun?",
  "4": "A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.",
  "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets; panting, [it returns] to its place where it rises.",
  "6": "Gusting to the south, turning to the north, turning, turning, goes the wind, and the wind returns in its cycles.",
  "7": "All the streams flow to the sea, yet the sea is never full. The streams are flowing to the place, and they flow there again.",
  "8": "All things are wearisome; man is unable to speak. The eye is not satisfied by seeing or the ear filled with hearing.",
  "9": "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.",
  "10": "Can one say about anything, \"Look, this is new\"? It has already existed in the ages before us.",
  "11": "There is no memory of those who came before; and of those who will come after there will also be no memory among those who follow [them].",
  "12": "I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
  "13": "I applied my mind to seek and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people this miserable task to keep them occupied.",
  "14": "I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.",
  "15": "What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.",
  "16": "I said to myself, \"Look, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped wisdom and knowledge.\"",
  "17": "I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind.",
  "18": "For with much wisdom is much sorrow; as knowledge increases, grief increases."
