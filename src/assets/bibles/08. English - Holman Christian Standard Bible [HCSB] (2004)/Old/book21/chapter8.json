  "2": "Keep the king's command. Concerning an oath by God,",
  "3": "do not be in a hurry. Leave his presence, and don't persist in a bad cause, since he will do whatever he wants.",
  "4": "For the king's word is authoritative, and who can say to him, \"What are you doing?\"",
  "5": "The one who keeps a command will not experience anything harmful, and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure.",
  "6": "For every activity there is a right time and procedure, even though man's troubles are heavy on him.",
  "7": "Yet no one knows what will happen, because who can tell him what will happen?",

  "15": "So I commended enjoyment, because there is nothing better for man under the sun except to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, for this will accompany him in his labor during the years of his days that God gives him under the sun.",
  "16": "When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the activity that is done on the earth (even though one's eyes do not close in sleep day or night),",
  "17": "I observed all the work of God [and concluded] that man is unable to discover the work that is done under the sun. Even though a man labors hard to explore it, he cannot find it; even if the wise man claims to know it, he is unable to discover it."
