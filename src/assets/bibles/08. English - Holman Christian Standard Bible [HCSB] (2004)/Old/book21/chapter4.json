  "1": "Again, I observed all the acts of oppression being done under the sun. Look at the tears of those who are oppressed; they have no one to comfort them. Power is with those who oppress them; they have no one to comfort them.",
  "2": "So I admired the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.",
