  "3": "Grief is better than laughter, for when a face is sad, a heart may be glad.",
  "4": "The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure.",
  "5": "It is better to listen to rebuke from a wise person than to listen to the song of fools.",
  "6": "For like the crackling of [burning] thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.",

  "29": "Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright, but they pursued many schemes.\""
