  "1": "Isn't mankind consigned to forced labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?",
  "2": "Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired man he waits for his pay.",
  "3": "So I have been made to inherit months of futility, and troubled nights have been assigned to me.",
  "4": "When I lie down I think: When will I get up? But the evening drags on endlessly, and I toss and turn until dawn.",
  "5": "My flesh is clothed with maggots and encrusted with dirt. My skin forms scabs and then oozes.",
  "6": "My days pass more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle; they come to an end without hope.",
  "7": "Remember that my life is [but] a breath. My eye will never again see anything good.",
  "8": "The eye of anyone who looks on me will no longer see me. Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.",
  "9": "As a cloud fades away and vanishes, so the one who goes down to Sheol will never rise again.",
  "10": "He will never return to his house; his hometown will no longer remember him.",
  "11": "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "Am I the sea or a sea monster, that You keep me under guard?",
  "13": "When I say: My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint,",
  "14": "then You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions,",
  "15": "so that I prefer strangling, death rather than life in this body.",
  "16": "I give up! I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.",
  "17": "What is man, that You think so highly of him and pay so much attention to him?",
  "18": "You inspect him every morning, and put him to the test every moment.",
  "19": "Will You ever look away from me, or leave me alone until I swallow my saliva?",
  "20": "[If] I have sinned, what have I done to You, Watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I have become a burden to You?",
  "21": "Why not forgive my sin and pardon my transgression? For soon I will lie down in the grave. You will eagerly seek me, but I will be gone."
