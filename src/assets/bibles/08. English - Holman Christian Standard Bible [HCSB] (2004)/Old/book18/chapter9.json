  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "Yes, I know what you've said is true, but how can a person be justified before God?",
  "3": "If one wanted to take Him to court, he could not answer God once in a thousand [times].",
  "4": "God is wise and all-powerful. Who has opposed Him and come out unharmed?",
  "5": "He removes mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in His anger.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth from its place so that its pillars tremble.",
  "7": "He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars.",
  "8": "He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.",
  "9": "He makes [the stars]: the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky.",
  "10": "He performs great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.",
  "11": "If He passes by me, I wouldn't see Him; [if] He goes right by, I wouldn't recognize Him.",
  "12": "If He snatches [something], who can stop Him? Who can ask Him, \"What are You doing?\"",
  "13": "God does not hold back His anger; Rahab's assistants cringe in fear beneath Him!",
  "14": "How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?",
  "15": "Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my judge for mercy.",
  "16": "If I summoned [Him] and He answered me, I do not believe He would pay attention to what I said.",
  "17": "He batters me with a whirlwind and multiplies my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "He doesn't let me catch my breath but soaks me with bitter experiences.",
  "19": "If it is a matter of strength, look, He is the Mighty One! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?",
  "20": "Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty.",
  "21": "Though I am blameless, I no longer care about myself; I renounce my life.",
  "22": "It is all the same. Therefore I say, \"He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.\"",
  "23": "When disaster brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "The earth is handed over to the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it isn't He, then who is it?",
  "25": "My days fly by faster than a runner; they flee without seeing any good.",
  "26": "They sweep by like boats made of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on [its] prey.",
  "27": "If I said, \"I will forget my complaint, change my expression, and smile,\"",
  "28": "I would still live in terror of all my pains. I know You will not acquit me.",
  "29": "Since I will be found guilty, why should I labor in vain?",
  "30": "If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,",
  "31": "then You dip me in a pit [of mud], and my own clothes despise me!",
  "32": "For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.",
  "33": "There is no one to judge between us, to lay his hand on both of us.",
  "34": "Let Him take His rod away from me so His terror will no longer frighten me.",
  "35": "Then I would speak and not fear Him. But that is not the case; I am on my own."
