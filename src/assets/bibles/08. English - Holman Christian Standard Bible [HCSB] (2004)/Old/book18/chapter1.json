  "1": "There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of perfect integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil.",
  "2": "He had seven sons and three daughters.",
  "3": "His estate included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.",
  "4": "His sons used to have banquets, each at his house in turn. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
  "5": "Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send [for his children] and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought: Perhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts. This was Job's regular practice.",
  "6": "One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.",
  "7": "The LORD asked Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" \"From roaming through the earth,\" Satan answered Him, \"and walking around on it.\"",
  "8": "Then the LORD said to Satan, \"Have you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil.\"",
  "9": "Satan answered the LORD, \"Does Job fear God for nothing?",
  "10": "Haven't You placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are spread out in the land.",
  "11": "But stretch out Your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse You to Your face.\"",
  "12": "\"Very well,\" the LORD told Satan, \"everything he owns is in your power. However, you must not lay a hand on Job [himself].\" So Satan went out from the Lord's presence.",
  "13": "One day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,",
  "14": "a messenger came to Job and reported: \"While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby,",
  "15": "the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\"",
  "16": "He was still speaking when another [messenger] came and reported: \"A lightning storm struck from heaven. It burned up the sheep and the servants, and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\"",
  "17": "That messenger was still speaking when [yet] another came and reported: \"The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\"",
  "18": "He was still speaking when another [messenger] came and reported: \"Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.",
  "19": "Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\"",
  "20": "Then Job stood up, tore his robe and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,",
  "21": "saying: Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will leave this life. The LORD gives, and the LORD takes away. Praise the name of the LORD.",
  "22": "Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything."
