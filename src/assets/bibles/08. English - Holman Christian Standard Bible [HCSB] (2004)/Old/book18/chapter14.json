  "1": "Man born of woman is short of days and full of trouble.",
  "2": "He blossoms like a flower, then withers; he flees like a shadow and does not last.",
  "3": "Do You really take notice of one like this? Will You bring me into judgment against You?",
  "4": "Who can produce something pure from what is impure? No one!",
  "5": "Since man's days are determined and the number of his months depends on You, and [since] You have set limits he cannot pass,",

  "7": "There is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its shoots will not die.",

  "18": "But as a mountain collapses and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,",
  "19": "as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil from the land, so You destroy a man's hope.",
  "20": "You completely overpower him, and he passes on; You change his appearance and send him away.",
  "21": "If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they become insignificant, he is unaware of it.",
  "22": "He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."
