  "1": "David asked, \"Is there anyone remaining from Saul's family I can show kindness to because of Jonathan?\"",
  "2": "There was a servant of Saul's family named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king said to him, \"Are you Ziba?\" \"[I am] your servant,\" he replied.",
  "3": "So the king asked, \"Is there anyone left of Saul's family I can show the kindness of God to?\" Ziba said to the king, \"There is still Jonathan's son who is lame in both feet.\"",
  "4": "The king asked him, \"Where is he?\" Ziba answered the king, \"You'll find him in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.\"",

  "10": "You, your sons, and your servants are to work the ground for him, and you are to bring in [the crops] so your master's grandson will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, is always to eat at my table.\" Now Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.",
  "11": "Ziba said to the king, \"Your servant will do all my lord the king commands.\" So Mephibosheth ate at David's table just like one of the king's sons.",
  "12": "Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. All those living in Ziba's house were Mephibosheth's servants.",
