  "13": "Still, none of this satisfies me since I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King's Gate all the time.\"",
  "14": "His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, \"Have them build a gallows 75 feet high. Ask the king in the morning to hang Mordecai on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself.\" The advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows constructed."
