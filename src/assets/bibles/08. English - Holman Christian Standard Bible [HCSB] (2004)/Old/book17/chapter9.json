  "4": "For Mordecai [exercised] great power in the palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces as he became more and more powerful.",

  "12": "The king said to Queen Esther, \"In the fortress of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men, including Haman's 10 sons. What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek will also be done.\"",

  "18": "But the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. They rested on the fifteenth day of the month, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing.",
  "19": "This explains why the rural Jews who live in villages observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as [a time of] rejoicing and feasting. It is a holiday when they send gifts to one another.",

  "21": "[He ordered] them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year",

  "23": "So the Jews agreed to continue the practice they had begun, as Mordecai had written them to do.",
  "24": "For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them. He cast the Pur (that is, the lot) to crush and destroy them.",

  "31": "in order to confirm these days of Purim at their proper time just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them and just as they had committed themselves and their descendants to the practices of fasting and lamentation.",
  "32": "So Esther's command confirmed these customs of Purim, which were then written into the record."
