  "3": "Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, \"Indeed, even if a fox climbed up what they are building, he would break down their stone wall!\"",
  "4": "Listen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.",
  "5": "Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from Your sight, because they have provoked the builders.",
  "6": "So we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its [height], for the people had the will to keep working.",
  "7": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they became furious.",
  "8": "They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion.",
  "9": "So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.",
  "10": "In Judah, it was said: The strength of the laborer fails, since there is so much rubble. We will never be able to rebuild the wall.",
  "11": "And our enemies said, \"They won't know or see anything until we're among them and can kill them and stop the work.\"",
  "12": "When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again, \"Everywhere you turn, [they] attack us.\"",

  "15": "When our enemies realized that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall.",
  "16": "From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers supported all the people of Judah,",

  "20": "Wherever you hear the trumpet sound, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!\"",
  "21": "So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out.",
