  "1": "The LORD spoke to Moses:",
  "2": "\"Consecrate every firstborn male to Me, the firstborn from every womb among the Israelites, both man and animal; it is Mine.\"",
  "3": "Then Moses said to the people, \"Remember this day when you came out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, for the LORD brought you out of here by the strength of [His] hand. Nothing leavened may be eaten.",
  "4": "Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.",
  "5": "When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you must carry out this ritual in this month.",
  "6": "For seven days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to the LORD.",
  "7": "Unleavened bread is to be eaten for those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, and no yeast may be found among you in all your territory.",
  "8": "On that day explain to your son, 'This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'",
  "9": "Let it serve as a sign for you on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a strong hand.",
  "10": "Keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.",
  "11": "\"When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,",

  "13": "You must redeem every firstborn of a donkey with a flock animal, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. However, you must redeem every firstborn among your sons.",
  "14": "\"In the future, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'By the strength of [His] hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.",
  "15": "When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of livestock. That is why I sacrifice to the LORD all the firstborn of the womb that are males, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.'",
