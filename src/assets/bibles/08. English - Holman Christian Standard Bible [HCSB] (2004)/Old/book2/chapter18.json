  "10": "\"Blessed is the LORD,\" Jethro exclaimed, \"who rescued you from Pharaoh and the power of the Egyptians, and snatched the people from the power of the Egyptians.",

  "18": "\"You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You can't do it alone.",
  "19": "Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and God be with you. You be the one to represent the people before God and bring their cases to Him.",

  "27": "Then Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law, and he journeyed to his own land."
