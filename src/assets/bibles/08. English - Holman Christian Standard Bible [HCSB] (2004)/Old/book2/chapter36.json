  "9": "The length of each curtain was 42 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet; all the curtains had the same measurements.",
  "10": "He joined five of the curtains to each other, and the [other] five curtains he joined to each other.",
  "11": "He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the last curtain in the first set and did the same on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.",
  "12": "He made 50 loops on the one curtain and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set, so that the loops lined up with each other.",
  "13": "He also made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains to each other, so that the tabernacle became a single unit.",
  "14": "He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he also made 11 of them.",
  "15": "The length of each curtain was 45 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet. All 11 curtains had the same measurements.",
  "16": "He joined five of the curtains together, and [the other] six together.",
  "17": "He made 50 loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the [first] set and 50 loops on the edge of the [corresponding] curtain in the second set.",
  "18": "He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together as a single unit.",
  "19": "He also made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red and a covering of manatee skins on top of it.",
  "20": "He made upright planks of acacia wood for the tabernacle.",
  "21": "The length of each plank was 15 feet, and the width of each was 27 inches.",
  "22": "There were two tenons connected to each other for each plank. He did the same for all the planks of the tabernacle.",
  "23": "He made planks for the tabernacle as follows: 20 for the south side,",
  "24": "and he made 40 silver bases to put under the 20 planks, two bases under the first plank for its two tenons, and two bases under each of the following planks for their two tenons;",
  "25": "for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made 20 planks,",
  "26": "with their 40 silver bases, two bases under the first plank and two bases under each of the following ones;",
  "27": "and for the west side of the tabernacle he made six planks.",
  "28": "He also made two additional planks for the two back corners of the tabernacle.",
  "29": "They were paired at the bottom and joined together at the top in a single ring. This is what he did with both of them for the two corners.",
  "30": "So there were eight planks with their 16 silver bases, two bases under each one.",
  "31": "He made five crossbars of acacia wood for the planks on one side of the tabernacle,",
  "32": "five crossbars for the planks on the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for those at the back of the tabernacle on the west.",
  "33": "He made the central crossbar run through the middle of the planks from one end to the other.",
  "34": "He overlaid them with gold and made their rings and holders for the crossbars out of gold. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.",
  "35": "Then he made the veil with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. He made it with a design of cherubim worked into it.",
  "36": "For it he made four posts of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold. And he cast four silver bases for the posts.",
  "37": "He made a screen embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen for the entrance to the tent,",
  "38": "together with its five posts and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, but their five bases were bronze."
