  "1": "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.",
  "2": "Like a lily among thorns, so is my darling among the young women.",
  "3": "Like an apricot tree among the trees of the forest, so is my love among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.",
  "4": "He brought me to the banquet hall, and he looked on me with love.",
  "5": "Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apricots, for I am lovesick.",
  "6": "His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.",
  "7": "Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you, by the gazelles and the wild does of the field: do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.",
  "8": "Listen! My love [is approaching]. Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.",

  "15": "Catch the foxes for us-- the little foxes that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyards are in bloom.",
  "16": "My love is mine and I am his; he feeds among the lilies.",
  "17": "Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn [to me], my love, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the divided mountains."
