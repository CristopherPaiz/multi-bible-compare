  "1": "How beautiful you are, my darling. How very beautiful! Behind your veil, your eyes are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.",
  "2": "Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn [sheep] coming up from washing, each one having a twin, and not one missing.",
  "3": "Your lips are like a scarlet cord, and your mouth is lovely. Behind your veil, your brow is like a slice of pomegranate.",
  "4": "Your neck is like the tower of David, constructed in layers. A thousand bucklers are hung on it-- all of them shields of warriors.",
  "5": "Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.",
  "6": "Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.",
  "7": "You are absolutely beautiful, my darling, with no imperfection in you.",
  "8": "Come with me from Lebanon, my bride-- with me from Lebanon! Descend from the peak of Amana, from the summit of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.",
  "9": "You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride. You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.",
  "10": "How delightful your love is, my sister, my bride. Your love is much better than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any balsam.",
  "11": "Your lips drip [sweetness like] the honeycomb, my bride. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.",
  "12": "My sister, my bride, [you are] a locked garden-- a locked garden and a sealed spring.",
  "13": "Your branches are a paradise of pomegranates with choicest fruits, henna with nard--",
  "14": "nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices.",
  "15": "[You are] a garden spring, a well of flowing water streaming from Lebanon.",
  "16": "Awaken, north wind-- come, south wind. Blow on my garden, and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my love come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits."
