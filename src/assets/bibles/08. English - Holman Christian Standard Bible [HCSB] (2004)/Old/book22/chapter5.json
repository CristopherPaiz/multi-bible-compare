  "1": "I have come to my garden-- my sister, my bride. I gather my myrrh with my spices. I eat my honeycomb with my honey. I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, be intoxicated with love!",
  "2": "I sleep, but my heart is awake. A sound! My love is knocking! Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. For my head is drenched with dew, my hair with droplets of the night.",
  "3": "I have taken off my clothing. How can I put it back on? I have washed my feet. How can I get them dirty?",
  "4": "My love thrust his hand through the opening, and my feelings were stirred for him.",
  "5": "I rose to open for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.",
  "6": "I opened to my love, but my love had turned and gone away. I was crushed that he had left. I sought him, but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer.",
  "7": "The guards who go about the city found me. They beat and wounded me; they took my cloak from me-- the guardians of the walls.",
  "8": "Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you: if you find my love, tell him that I am lovesick.",
  "9": "What makes the one you love better than another, most beautiful of women? What makes him better than another, that you would give us this charge?",
  "10": "My love is fit and strong, notable among ten thousand.",
  "11": "His head is purest gold. His hair is wavy and black as a raven.",
  "12": "His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, washed in milk and set like jewels.",
  "13": "His cheeks are like beds of spice, towers of perfume. His lips are lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.",
  "14": "His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is an ivory panel covered with sapphires.",
  "15": "His legs are alabaster pillars set on pedestals of pure gold. His presence is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars.",
  "16": "His mouth is sweetness. He is absolutely desirable. This is my love, and this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem."
