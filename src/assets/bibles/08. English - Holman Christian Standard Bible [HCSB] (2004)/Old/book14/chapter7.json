  "6": "The priests were standing at their stations, as were the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made to praise the LORD-- \"for His faithful love endures forever\"-- when David offered praise with them. Across from them, the priests were blowing trumpets, and all the people were standing.",
  "7": "Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORD's temple because that was where he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings since the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not accommodate the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat [of the fellowship offerings].",
  "8": "So Solomon and all Israel with him-- a very great assembly, from the entrance to Hamath to the Brook of Egypt-- observed the festival at that time for seven days.",

  "18": "I will establish your royal throne, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.",

  "21": "As for this temple, which was exalted, every passerby will be appalled and will say: Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?",
  "22": "Then they will say: Because they abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They clung to other gods and worshiped and served them. Because of this, He brought all this ruin on them."
