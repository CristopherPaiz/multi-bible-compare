  "1": "Now listen to what the LORD is saying: Rise, plead [your] case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.",
  "2": "Listen to the LORD's lawsuit, you mountains and enduring foundations of the earth, because the LORD has a case against His people, and He will argue it against Israel.",
  "3": "My people, what have I done to you, or how have I wearied you? Testify against Me!",
  "4": "Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from that place of slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you.",
  "5": "My people, remember what Balak king of Moab proposed, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and [what happened] from Acacia Grove to Gilgal, so that you may acknowledge the LORD's righteous acts.",
  "6": "What should I bring before the LORD when I come to bow before God on high? Should I come before Him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?",

  "8": "He has told you men what is good and what it is the LORD requires of you: Only to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God.",
  "9": "The voice of the LORD calls out to the city (and it is wise to fear Your name): \"Pay attention to the rod and the One who ordained it.",
  "10": "Are there still the treasures of wickedness and the accursed short measure in the house of the wicked?",

  "15": "You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not anoint yourself with oil; and [you will tread] grapes but not drink the wine.",
  "16": "The statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house have been observed; you have followed their policies. Therefore, I will make you a desolate place and the city's residents an object of contempt; you will bear the scorn of My people.\""
