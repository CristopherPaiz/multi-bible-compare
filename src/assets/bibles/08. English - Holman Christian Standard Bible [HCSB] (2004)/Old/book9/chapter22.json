  "1": "So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When David's brothers and his father's whole family heard, they went down and joined him there.",

  "3": "From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab where he said to the king of Moab, \"Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.\"",
  "4": "So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold.",

  "6": "Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree at the high place. His spear was in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.",
  "7": "Saul said to his servants, \"Listen, men of Benjamin: Is Jesse's son going to give all of you fields and vineyards? [Do you think] he'll make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?",
  "8": "That's why all of you have conspired against me! Nobody tells me when my own son makes a covenant with Jesse's son. None of you cares about me or tells me that my son has stirred up my own servant to wait in ambush for me, as [is the case] today.\"",
  "9": "Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, answered: \"I saw Jesse's son come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.",

  "14": "Ahimelech replied to the king: \"Who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, and honored in your house.",
  "15": "Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Please don't let the king make an accusation against your servant or any of my father's household, for your servant didn't have any idea about all this.\"",
  "16": "But the king said, \"You will die, Ahimelech-- you and your father's whole family!\"",
