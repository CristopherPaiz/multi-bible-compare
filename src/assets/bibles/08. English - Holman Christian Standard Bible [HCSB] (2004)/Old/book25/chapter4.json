  "1": "How the gold has become tarnished, the fine gold become dull! The stones of the temple lie scattered at the corner of every street.",
  "2": "Zion's precious people-- [once] worth their weight in pure gold-- how they are regarded as clay jars, the work of a potter's hands!",
  "3": "Even jackals offer [their] breasts to nurse their young, but my dear people have become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness.",
  "4": "The nursing infant's tongue clings to the roof of his mouth from thirst. Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them [any].",
  "5": "Those who used to eat delicacies are destitute in the streets; those who were reared in purple [garments] huddle in garbage heaps.",
  "6": "The punishment of my dear people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand laid on it.",
  "7": "Her dignitaries were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; [their] bodies were more ruddy than coral, their appearance [like] sapphire.",
  "8": "[Now] they appear darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become dry like wood.",
  "9": "Those slain by the sword are better off than those slain by hunger, who waste away, pierced [with pain] because the fields lack produce.",
  "10": "The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children; they became their food during the destruction of my dear people.",
  "11": "The LORD has exhausted His wrath, poured out His burning anger; He has ignited a fire in Zion, and it has consumed her foundations.",
  "12": "The kings of the earth and all the world's inhabitants did not believe that an enemy or adversary could enter Jerusalem's gates.",
  "13": "[Yet it happened] because of the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous within her.",
  "14": "Blind, they stumbled in the streets, defiled by this blood, so that no one dared to touch their garments.",
  "15": "\"Stay away! Unclean!\" people shouted at them. \"Away, away! Don't touch [us]!\" So they wandered aimlessly. It was said among the nations, \"They can stay here no longer.\"",
  "16": "The LORD Himself has scattered them; He regards them no more. The priests are not respected; the elders find no favor.",
  "17": "All the while our eyes were failing [as we looked] in vain for assistance; we watched from our towers for a nation that refused to help.",
  "18": "Our steps were closely followed, so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end drew near; our time ran out. Our end had come!",
  "19": "Those who chased us were swifter than eagles in the sky; they relentlessly pursued us over the mountains and ambushed us in the wilderness.",
  "20": "The LORD's anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their traps; we had said about him: We will live under his protection among the nations.",
  "21": "So rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you resident of the land of Uz! Yet the cup will pass to you as well; you will get drunk and expose yourself.",
  "22": "Daughter Zion, your punishment is complete; He will not lengthen your exile. But He will punish your iniquity, Daughter Edom, and will expose your sins."
