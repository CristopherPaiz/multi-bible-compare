  "1": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "\"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them: This is what the Lord God says to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves! Shouldn't the shepherds feed their flock?",
  "3": "You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fatlings, but you do not tend the flock.",
  "4": "You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty.",
  "5": "They were scattered for lack of a shepherd; they became food for all the wild animals when they were scattered.",
  "6": "My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the whole face of the earth, and there was no one searching or seeking [for them].",
  "7": "\"Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD.",
  "8": "As I live\"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- \"because My flock has become [prey and] food for every wild animal since [they] lack a shepherd, for My shepherds do not search for My flock, and [because] the shepherds feed themselves rather than My flock,",
  "9": "therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD!",
  "10": "\"This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against the shepherds. I will demand My flock from them and prevent them from shepherding the flock. The shepherds will no longer feed themselves, for I will rescue My flock from their mouths so that they will not be food for them.",
  "11": "\"For this is what the Lord God says: See, I Myself will search for My flock and look for them.",
  "12": "As a shepherd looks for his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will look for My flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy and dark day.",
  "13": "I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will shepherd them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the land.",
  "14": "I will tend them with good pasture, and their grazing place will be on Israel's lofty mountains. There they will lie down in a good grazing place; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.",
  "15": "I will tend My flock and let them lie down.\" [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.",
  "16": "\"I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bandage the injured, and strengthen the weak, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will shepherd them with justice.",
  "17": "\"The Lord God says to you, My flock: I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and male goats.",
  "18": "Isn't it enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or [isn't it enough] that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?",
  "19": "Yet My flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied.",
  "20": "\"Therefore, this is what the Lord God says to them: See, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.",
  "21": "Since you have pushed with flank and shoulder and butted all the weak ones with your horns until you scattered them all over,",
  "22": "I will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey for you. I will judge between one sheep and another.",
  "23": "I will appoint over them a single shepherd, My servant David, and he will shepherd them. He will tend them himself and will be their shepherd.",
  "24": "I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be a prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken.",
  "25": "\"I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate dangerous animals in the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest.",
  "26": "I will make them and the area around My hill a blessing: I will send down showers in their season-- showers of blessing.",
  "27": "The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslave them.",
  "28": "They will no longer be prey for the nations, and the wild animals of the land will not consume them. They will live securely, and no one will frighten [them].",
  "29": "I will establish for them a place renowned for [its] agriculture, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land. They will no longer endure the insults of the nations.",
  "30": "Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people.\" [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.",
  "31": "\"You are My flock, the human flock of My pasture, and I am your God.\" [This is] the declaration of the Lord God."
