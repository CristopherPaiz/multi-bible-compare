  "1": "In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been captured, on that very day the LORD's hand was on me, and He brought me there.",
  "2": "In visions of God He took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. On its southern [slope] was a structure resembling a city.",
  "3": "He brought me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. He was standing by the gate.",
  "4": "He spoke to me: \"Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for you have been brought here so that I might show [it] to you. Report everything you see to the house of Israel.\"",
  "5": "Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. The measuring rod in the man's hand was six units of 21 inches; each unit was the standard length plus three inches. He measured the thickness of the [wall] structure; it was about 10 feet, and its height was the same.",
  "6": "Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate; it was 10 feet deep-- the first threshold was 10 feet deep.",
  "7": "Each recess was about 10 feet long and 10 feet deep, and there was [a space of] eight and three-quarter feet between the recesses. The [inner] threshold of the gate on the temple side next to the gate's portico was about 10 feet.",
  "8": "Next he measured the portico of the gate;",
  "9": "it was 14 feet, and its pilasters were three and a half feet. The portico of the gate was on the temple side.",
  "10": "There were three recesses on each side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the pilasters on either side also had the same measurements.",
  "11": "Then he measured the width of the gate's entrance; it was 17 and a half feet, while the width of the gateway was 22 and three-quarter feet.",
  "12": "There was a barrier of 21 inches in front of the recesses on both sides, and the recesses on each side were 10 and a half feet square.",
  "13": "Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one recess to the roof of the [opposite] one; the distance was 43 and three-quarter feet. The openings of the recesses faced each other.",
  "14": "Next, he measured the pilasters-- 105 feet. The gate extended around to the pilaster of the court.",
  "15": "[The distance] from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the gate's portico on the inside was 87 and a half feet.",
  "16": "The recesses and their pilasters had beveled windows all around the inside of the gateway. The porticos also had windows all around on the inside. Each pilaster was decorated with palm trees.",
  "17": "Then he brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a paved surface laid out all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement,",
  "18": "which flanked the gates and corresponded to the length of the gates; [this] was the lower pavement.",
  "19": "Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court; it was 175 feet. [This] was the east; next the north [is described].",
  "20": "He measured the gate of the outer court facing north, [both] its length and width.",
  "21": "Its three recesses on each side, its pilasters, and its portico had the same measurements as the first gate: 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.",
  "22": "Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate that faced east. Seven steps led up to the gate, and its portico was ahead of them.",
  "23": "The inner court had a gate facing the north gate, like the one on the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate; it was 175 feet.",
  "24": "He brought me to the south side, and there was also a gate on the south. He measured its pilasters and portico; they had the same measurements as the others.",
  "25": "Both the gate and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.",
  "26": "Its stairway had seven steps, and its portico was ahead of them. It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on each side.",
  "27": "The inner court had a gate on the south. He measured from gate to gate on the south; it was 175 feet.",
  "28": "Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements as the others.",
  "29": "Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.",
  "30": "(There were porticoes all around, 43 and three-quarter feet long and eight and three-quarter feet wide.)",
  "31": "Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees. Its stairway had eight steps.",
  "32": "Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. When he measured the gate, it had the same measurements as the others.",
  "33": "Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.",
  "34": "Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.",
  "35": "Then he brought me to the north gate. When he measured [it], it had the same measurements as the others,",
  "36": "[as did] its recesses, pilasters, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.",
  "37": "Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.",
  "38": "There was a chamber whose door [opened] into the portico of the gate. The burnt offering was to be washed there.",
  "39": "Inside the portico of the gate there were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, sin offering, and restitution offering.",
  "40": "Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two [more] tables on the other side of the gate's portico.",
  "41": "So there were four tables inside the gate and four outside, eight tables [in all] on which the slaughtering was to be done.",
  "42": "There were also four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering, [each] 31 and a half inches long, 31 and a half inches wide, and 21 inches high. The utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and [other] sacrifices were placed on them.",
  "43": "There were three-inch hooks fastened all around the inside of the room, and the flesh of the offering was to be laid on the tables.",
  "44": "Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were chambers for the singers: one beside the north gate, facing south, and another beside the south gate, facing north.",
  "45": "Then the man said to me: \"This chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple.",
  "46": "The chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the ones from the sons of Levi who may approach the LORD to serve Him.\"",
  "47": "Next he measured the court. It was square, 175 feet long and 175 feet wide. The altar was in front of the temple.",
  "48": "Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the pilasters of the portico; they were eight and three-quarter feet [thick] on each side. The width of the gateway was 24 and a half feet, and the sidewalls of the gate were five and a quarter feet [wide] on each side.",
  "49": "The portico was 35 feet across and 21 feet deep, and 10 steps led up to it. There were pillars by the pilasters, one on each side."
