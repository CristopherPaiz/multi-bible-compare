  "1": "And the word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "\"Son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.",
  "3": "The end is now on you; I will send My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your abominations.",
  "4": "I will not look on you with pity or spare [you], but I will punish you for your ways and for your abominations within you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.\"",
  "5": "This is what the Lord God says: Look, one disaster after another is coming!",
  "6": "An end has come; the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming!",
  "7": "Doom has come on you, inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day is near. There will be panic on the mountains and not celebration.",
  "8": "I will pour out My wrath on you very soon; I will exhaust My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your abominations.",
  "9": "I will not look on [you] with pity or spare [you]. I will punish you for your ways and for your abominations within you. Then you will know that it is I, the LORD, who strikes.",
  "10": "Look, the day is coming! Doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed; arrogance has bloomed.",
  "11": "Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness; none of them [will remain]: none of their multitude, none of their wealth, and none of the eminent among them.",
  "12": "The time has come; the day has arrived. Let the buyer not rejoice and the seller not mourn, for wrath is on all her multitude.",
  "13": "The seller will certainly not return to what was sold as long as he and the buyer remain alive. For the vision concerning all its people will not be revoked, and none of them will preserve his life because of his iniquity.",
  "14": "They have blown the trumpet and prepared everything, but no one goes to war, for My wrath is on all her multitude.",
  "15": "The sword is on the outside; plague and famine are on the inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and plague will devour whoever is in the city.",
  "16": "The survivors among them will escape and live on the mountains like doves of the valley, all of them moaning, each over his own iniquity.",
  "17": "All their hands will become weak, and all [their] knees will turn to water.",
  "18": "They will put on sackcloth, and horror will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all [their] faces, and all their heads will be bald.",
  "19": "They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will seem like something filthy. Their silver and gold will be unable to save them in the day of the LORD's wrath. They will not satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs, for these were the stumbling blocks that brought about their iniquity.",
  "20": "He appointed His beautiful ornaments for majesty, but they made their abhorrent images from them, their detestable things. Therefore, I have made these into something filthy for them.",
  "21": "I will hand these things over to foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane them.",
  "22": "I will turn My face from the wicked as they profane My treasured place. Violent men will enter it and profane it.",
  "23": "Forge the chain, for the land is filled with crimes of bloodshed, and the city is filled with violence.",
  "24": "So I will bring the most evil of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their sacred places will be profaned.",
  "25": "Anguish is coming! They will seek peace, but there will be none.",
  "26": "Disaster after disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priests and counsel from the elders.",
  "27": "The king will mourn; the prince will be clothed in grief; and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their own conduct, and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
