  "1": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "\"Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir and prophesy against it.",
  "3": "Say to it: This is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against you, Mount Seir. I will stretch out My hand against you and make you a desolate waste.",
  "4": "I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.",
  "5": "\"Because you maintained an ancient hatred and handed over the Israelites to the power of the sword in the time of their disaster, the time of final punishment,",
  "6": "therefore, as I live\"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- \"I will destine you for bloodshed, and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.",

  "8": "I will fill its mountains with the slain; those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.",
  "9": "I will make you a perpetual desolation; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.",

  "11": "therefore, as I live\"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- \"I will treat [you] according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them. I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.",
  "12": "Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all the blasphemies you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate. They have been given to us to devour!",
  "13": "You boasted against Me with your mouth, and spoke many words against Me. I heard [it] Myself!",
  "14": "\"This is what the Lord God says: While the whole world rejoices, I will make you a desolation.",
  "15": "Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it became a desolation, so I will deal with you: you will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and [so will] all Edom in its entirety. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
