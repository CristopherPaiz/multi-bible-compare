  "1": "He said to me: \"Son of man, eat what you find [here]. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel.\"",
  "2": "So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.",
  "3": "\"Son of man,\" he said to me, \"eat and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you.\" So I ate [it], and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
  "4": "Then He said to me: \"Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.",
  "5": "For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language but to the house of Israel.",
  "6": "[You are] not [being sent] to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.",
  "7": "But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to Me. For the whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hardhearted.",
  "8": "Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.",
  "9": "I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don't be afraid of them or discouraged by [the look on] their faces, even though they are a rebellious house.\"",
  "10": "Next He said to me: \"Son of man, listen carefully to all My words that I speak to you and take [them] to heart.",
  "11": "Go to your people, the exiles, and speak to them. Tell them: This is what the Lord God says, whether they listen or refuse [to listen].\"",
  "12": "The Spirit then lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me-- praise the glory of the LORD in His place!--",
  "13": "with the sound of the living creatures' wings brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.",
  "14": "So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I left in bitterness and in an angry spirit, and the LORD's hand was on me powerfully.",
  "15": "I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there stunned for seven days.",
  "16": "Now at the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:",
  "17": "\"Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.",
  "18": "If I say to the wicked person: You will surely die, but you do not warn him-- you don't speak out to warn him about his wicked way in order to save his life-- that wicked person will die for his iniquity. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.",
  "19": "But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.",
  "20": "Now if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, and I put a stumbling block in front of him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die because of his sin and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.",
  "21": "But if you warn the righteous person that he should not sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he listened to [your] warning, and you will have saved your life.\"",
  "22": "Then the hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, \"Get up, go out to the plain, and I will speak with you there.\"",
  "23": "So I got up and went out to the plain. The LORD's glory was present there, like the glory I had seen by the Chebar Canal, and I fell facedown.",
  "24": "The Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said: \"Go, shut yourself inside your house.",
  "25": "And you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so you cannot go out among them.",
  "26": "I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be mute and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.",
  "27": "But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them: This is what the Lord God says. Let the one who listens, listen, and let the one who refuses, refuse-- for they are a rebellious house."
