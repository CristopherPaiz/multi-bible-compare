  "1": "Then the word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "\"Son of man, how does the wood of the vine, that branch among the trees of the forest, compare to any other wood?",
  "3": "Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?",
  "4": "In fact, it is put into the fire as fuel. The fire devours both of its ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything?",
  "5": "Even when it was whole it could not be made into a useful object. How much less can it ever be made into anything useful when the fire has devoured it and it is charred!",
  "6": "\"Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire as fuel, so I will give up the residents of Jerusalem.",
  "7": "I will turn against them. They may have escaped from the fire, but it will [still] consume them. And you will know that I am the LORD when I turn against them.",
  "8": "I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully.\" [This is] the declaration of the Lord God."
