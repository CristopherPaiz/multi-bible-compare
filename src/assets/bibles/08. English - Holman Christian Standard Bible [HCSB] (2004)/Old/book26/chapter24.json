  "1": "The word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth [day] of the month:",
  "2": "\"Son of man, write down today's date, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.",
  "3": "Now speak a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them: This is what the Lord God says: Put the pot on [the fire]-- put [it] on, and then pour water into it!",
  "4": "Place the pieces of meat in it, every good piece-- thigh and shoulder. Fill it with choice bones.",
  "5": "Take the choicest of the flock and also pile up the fuel under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.\"",
  "6": "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, the pot that has rust inside it, and whose rust will not come off! Empty it piece by piece; lots should not be cast for its contents.",
  "7": "For the blood she shed is in her midst. She put it out on the bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.",
  "8": "In order to stir up wrath and take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered.",
  "9": "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I Myself will make the pile of kindling large.",
  "10": "Pile on the logs and kindle the fire! Cook the meat well and mix in the spices! Let the bones be burned!",
  "11": "Set the empty pot on its coals so that it becomes hot and its copper glows. Then its impurity will melt inside it; its rust will be consumed.",
  "12": "It has frustrated every effort; its thick rust will not come off. Into the fire with its rust!",
  "13": "Because of the indecency of your uncleanness-- since I tried to purify you, but you would not be purified from your uncleanness-- you will not be pure again until I have satisfied My wrath on you.",
  "14": "I, the LORD, have spoken. It is coming, and I will do it! I will not refrain, I will not show pity, and I will not relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.",
  "15": "Then the word of the LORD came to me:",
  "16": "\"Son of man, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a fatal blow. But you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow.",
  "17": "Groan quietly; do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover [your] mustache or eat the bread of mourners.\"",
  "18": "I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did just as I was commanded.",
  "19": "Then the people asked me, \"Won't you tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?\"",
  "20": "So I answered them: \"The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "21": "'Say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your heart. Also, the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.",
  "22": "Then you will do just as I have done: You will not cover [your] mustache or eat the bread of mourners.",
  "23": "Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not lament or weep but will waste away because of your sins and will groan to one another.",
  "24": "Now Ezekiel will be a sign for you. You will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God.",
  "25": "\" 'Son of man, know that on the day I take their stronghold from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes and the longing of their hearts, [as well as] their sons and daughters,",
  "26": "on that day a fugitive will come to you and report the news.",
  "27": "On that day your mouth will be opened [to talk] with him; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am the LORD.'\""
