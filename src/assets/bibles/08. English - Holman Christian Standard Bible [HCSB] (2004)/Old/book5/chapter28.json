  "67": "In the morning you will say, 'If only it were evening!' and in the evening you will say, 'If only it were morning!'-- because of the dread you will have in your heart and because of what you will see.",
  "68": "The LORD will take you back in ships to Egypt by a route that I said you would never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy [you].\""
