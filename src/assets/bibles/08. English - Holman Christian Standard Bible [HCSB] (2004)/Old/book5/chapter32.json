  "4": "The Rock-- His work is perfect; all His ways are entirely just. A faithful God, without prejudice, He is righteous and true.",
  "5": "His people have acted corruptly toward Him; this is their defect-- they are not His children but a devious and crooked generation.",
  "6": "Is this how you repay the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Isn't He your Father and Creator? Didn't He make you and sustain you?",
  "7": "Remember the days of old; consider the years long past. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will teach you.",
  "8": "When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance and divided the human race, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the people of Israel.",

  "12": "The LORD alone led him, with no help from a foreign god.",
  "13": "He made him ride on the heights of the land and eat the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from flintlike rock,",
  "14": "cream from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs, rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat; you drank wine from the finest grapes.",
  "15": "Then Jeshurun became fat and rebelled-- you became fat, bloated, and gorged. He abandoned the God who made him and scorned the Rock of his salvation.",
  "16": "They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods; they enraged Him with detestable practices.",

  "20": "He said: \"I will hide My face from them; I will see what will become of them, for they are a perverse generation-- unfaithful children.",
  "21": "They have provoked My jealousy with [their] so-called gods; they have enraged Me with their worthless idols. So I will provoke their jealousy with an inferior people; I will enrage them with a foolish nation.",
  "22": "For fire has been kindled because of My anger and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the land and its produce, and scorches the foundations of the mountains.",
  "23": "I will pile disasters on them; I will use up My arrows against them.",

  "37": "He will say: \"Where are their gods, the 'rock' they found refuge in?",
  "38": "Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let it be a shelter for you.",
  "39": "See now that I alone am He; there is no God but Me. I bring death and I give life; I wound and I heal. No one can rescue [anyone] from My hand.",
  "40": "I raise My hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,",
  "41": "when I sharpen My flashing sword, and My hand takes hold of judgment, I will take vengeance on My adversaries and repay those who hate Me.",

  "48": "On that same day the LORD spoke to Moses,",
  "49": "\"Go up Mount Nebo in the Abarim [range] in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan I am giving the Israelites as a possession.",
  "50": "Then you will die on the mountain that you go up, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.",
