  "1": "\"Therefore, this decree is for you priests:",
  "2": "If you don't listen, and if you don't take it to heart to honor My name,\" says the LORD of Hosts, \"I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. In fact, I have already begun to curse them because you are not taking it to heart.",
  "3": "\"Look, I am going to rebuke your descendants, and I will spread animal waste over your faces, the waste from your festival sacrifices, and you will be taken away with it.",
  "4": "Then you will know that I sent you this decree so My covenant with Levi may continue,\" says the LORD of Hosts.",
  "5": "\"My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave these to him; it called for reverence, and he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.",
  "6": "True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing wrong was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and fairness and turned many from sin.",
  "7": "For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.",
  "8": "\"You, on the other hand, have turned from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have violated the covenant of Levi,\" says the LORD of Hosts.",
  "9": "\"So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people because you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in [your] instruction.\"",
  "10": "Don't all of us have one Father? Didn't one God create us? Why then do we act treacherously against one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
  "11": "Judah has acted treacherously, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the LORD's sanctuary, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.",
  "12": "To the man who does this, may the LORD cut off any descendants from the tents of Jacob, even if they present an offering to the LORD of Hosts.",
  "13": "And this is another thing you do: you cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning, because He no longer respects your offerings or receives [them] gladly from your hands.",
  "14": "Yet you ask, \"For what reason?\" Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have acted treacherously against her, though she was your marriage partner and your wife by covenant.",
  "15": "Didn't the one [God] make [us] with a remnant of His life-breath? And what does the One seek? A godly offspring. So watch yourselves carefully, and do not act treacherously against the wife of your youth.",
  "16": "\"If he hates and divorces [his wife],\" says the LORD God of Israel, \"he covers his garment with injustice,\" says the LORD of Hosts. Therefore, watch yourselves carefully, and do not act treacherously.",
  "17": "You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you ask, \"How have we wearied [Him]?\" When you say, \"Everyone who does evil is good in the LORD's sight, and He is pleased with them,\" or \"Where is the God of justice?\""
