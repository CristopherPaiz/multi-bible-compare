  "1": "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.",
  "2": "[The more] they called them, [the more] they departed from Me. They kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols.",
  "3": "It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never knew that I healed them.",
  "4": "I led them with human cords, with ropes of kindness. To them I was like one who eases the yoke from their jaws; I bent down to give them food.",
  "5": "Israel will not return to the land of Egypt and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to repent.",
  "6": "A sword will whirl through his cities; it will destroy and devour the bars of his gates, because of their schemes.",
  "7": "My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to Him on high, He will not exalt them at all.",
  "8": "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I surrender you, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? I have had a change of heart; My compassion is stirred!",
  "9": "I will not vent the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not come in rage.",
  "10": "They will follow the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.",
  "11": "They will be roused like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes. [This is] the LORD's declaration.",
  "12": "Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel, with deceit. Judah still wanders with El and is faithful to holy ones."
