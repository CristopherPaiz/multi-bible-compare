  "1": "when I heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim and the crimes of Samaria will be exposed. For they practice fraud; a thief breaks in; a gang pillages outside.",

  "5": "On the day of our king, the princes are sick with the heat of wine-- there is a conspiracy with traitors.",
  "6": "For they-- their hearts like an oven-- draw him into their oven. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.",

  "14": "They do not cry to Me from their hearts; rather, they wail on their beds. They slash themselves for grain and wine; they turn away from Me.",
  "15": "I trained and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against Me.",
  "16": "They turn, but not to what is above; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of the cursing of their tongue. They will be ridiculed for this in the land of Egypt."
