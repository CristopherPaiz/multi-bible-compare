  "1": "Call your brothers: My People and your sisters: Compassion.",
  "2": "Rebuke your mother; rebuke [her]. For she is not My wife and I am not her husband. Let her remove the promiscuous look from her face and her adultery from between her breasts.",
  "3": "Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her as she was on the day of her birth. I will make her like a desert and like a parched land, and I will let her die of thirst.",
  "4": "I will have no compassion on her children because they are the children of promiscuity.",
  "5": "For their mother is promiscuous; she conceived them and acted shamefully. For she thought: I will go after my lovers, the men who give me my food and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink.",
  "6": "Therefore, this is what I will do: I will block her way with thorns; I will enclose her with a wall, so that she cannot find her paths.",
  "7": "She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will seek them but not find [them]. Then she will think: I will go back to my former husband, for then it was better for me than now.",
  "8": "She does not recognize that it is I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil. I lavished silver and gold on her, which they used for Baal.",
  "9": "Therefore, I will take back My grain in its time and My new wine in its season; I will take away My wool and linen, which were to cover her nakedness.",
  "10": "Now I will expose her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from My hands.",
  "11": "I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths-- all her festivals.",
  "12": "I will devastate her vines and fig trees. She thinks that these are her wages that her lovers have given her. I will turn them into a thicket, and the wild animals will eat them.",
  "13": "And I will punish her for the days of the Baals when she burned incense to them, put on her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but forgot Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.",
  "14": "Therefore, I am going to persuade her, lead her to the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.",
  "15": "There I will give her vineyards back to her and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as [she did] in the days of her youth, as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt.",
  "16": "In that day-- the LORD's declaration-- you will call [Me]: My husband, and no longer call Me: My Baal.",
  "17": "For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth; they will no longer be remembered by their names.",
  "18": "On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely.",
  "19": "I will take you to be My wife forever. I will take you to be My wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion.",
  "20": "I will take you to be My wife in faithfulness, and you will know the LORD.",
  "21": "On that day I will respond-- the LORD's declaration. I will respond to the sky, and it will respond to the earth.",
  "22": "The earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.",
  "23": "I will sow her in the land for Myself, and I will have compassion on No Compassion; I will say to Not My People: You are My people, and he will say: [You are] My God."
