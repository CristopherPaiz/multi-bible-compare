  "2": "\"Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the temple of the LORD to offer them a drink of wine.\"",
  "3": "So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons-- the entire house of the Rechabites--",
  "4": "and I brought them into the temple of the LORD to a chamber [occupied by] the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who had a chamber near the officials' chamber, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.",
  "5": "I set jars filled with wine and some cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites and said to them, \"Drink wine!\"",
  "6": "But they replied, \"We do not drink wine, for Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, commanded: 'You and your sons must never drink wine.",
  "7": "You must not build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. [Those things] are not for you. Rather, you must live in tents your whole life, so you may live a long time on the soil where you stay as a resident alien.'",
  "8": "We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, in all he commanded us. So we haven't drunk wine our whole life-- we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.",

  "15": "Time and time again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: Turn, each one from his evil way of life, and correct your actions. Stop following other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not pay attention or obey Me.",
  "16": "Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out their ancestor's command he gave them, but these people have not obeyed Me.",
  "17": "Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them, but they would not answer.\"",
  "18": "Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: \"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and have kept all his commands and have done all that he commanded you,",
