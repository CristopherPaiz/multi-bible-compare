  "1": "Then the LORD said to me: \"Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My compassions would not [reach out] to these people. Send them from My presence, and let them go.",
  "2": "If they ask you: Where will we go? you must tell them: This is what the LORD says: Those [destined] for death, to death; those [destined] for the sword, to the sword. Those [destined] for famine, to famine; those [destined] for captivity, to captivity.",
  "3": "\"I will ordain four kinds [of judgment] for them\"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- \"the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land to devour and destroy.",
  "4": "I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.",
  "5": "Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will show sympathy toward you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?",
  "6": "You have left Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration. You have turned your back, so I have stretched out My hand against you and destroyed you. I am tired of showing compassion.",
  "7": "I scattered them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I made [them] childless; I destroyed My people. They would not turn from their ways.",
  "8": "I made their widows more numerous than the sand of the seas. I brought against the mother of young men a destroyer at noon. I suddenly released on her agitation and terrors.",
  "9": "The mother of seven grew faint; she breathed her [last] breath. Her sun set while it was still day; she was ashamed and humiliated. The rest of them I will give over to the sword in the presence of their enemies.\" [This is] the LORD's declaration.",
  "10": "Woe is me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man who incites dispute and conflict in all the land. I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me.",
  "11": "The LORD said: Assuredly, I will set you free and care for you. Assuredly, I will intercede for you in a time of trouble, in your time of distress, with the enemy.",
  "12": "Can anyone smash iron, iron from the north, or bronze?",
  "13": "Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without cost, for all your sins, and within all your borders.",
  "14": "Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for My anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.",
  "15": "You know, LORD; remember me and take note of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In Your patience, don't take me away. Know that I suffer disgrace for Your honor.",
  "16": "Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the joy of my heart, for I am called by Your name, LORD God of Hosts.",
  "17": "I never sat with the band of revelers, and I did not celebrate [with them]. Because Your hand was [on me], I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation.",
  "18": "Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You truly have become like a mirage to me-- water that is not reliable.",
  "19": "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: If you return, I will restore you; you will stand in My presence. And if you speak noble [words], rather than worthless ones, you will be My spokesman. It is they who must return to you; you must not return to them.",
  "20": "Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you. [This is] the LORD's declaration.",
  "21": "I will deliver you from the power of evil people and redeem you from the control of the ruthless."
