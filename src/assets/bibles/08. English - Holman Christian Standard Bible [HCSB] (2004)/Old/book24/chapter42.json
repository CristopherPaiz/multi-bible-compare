  "2": "Jeremiah the prophet and said, \"May our petition come before you; pray to the LORD your God on our behalf, on behalf of this entire remnant (for few of us remain out of the many, as you can see with your own eyes),",
  "3": "that the LORD your God may tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do.\"",
  "4": "So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, \"I have heard. I will now pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and every word that the LORD answers you I will tell you; I won't withhold a word from you.\"",
  "5": "And they said to Jeremiah, \"As for every word the LORD your God sends you to [tell] us, if we don't act accordingly, may the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us.",
  "6": "Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you so that it may go well with us. We will certainly obey the voice of the LORD our God!\"",

  "9": "He said to them, \"This is what the LORD says, the God of Israel to whom you sent me to bring your petition before Him:",
  "10": "'If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you, and I will plant and not uproot you, because I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought on you.",
  "11": "Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear; don't be afraid of him'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'because I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.",

  "16": "then the sword you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine you are worried about will follow on your heels there to Egypt, and you will die there.",
  "17": "All who resolve to go to Egypt to live there for a while will die by the sword, famine, and plague. They will have no survivor or escapee from the disaster I will bring on them.'",
  "18": "\"For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Just as My anger and fury were poured out on Jerusalem's residents, so will My fury pour out on you if you go to Egypt.

  "21": "For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in everything He has sent me to [tell] you.",
  "22": "Now therefore, know for certain that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place where you desired to go to live for a while.\""
