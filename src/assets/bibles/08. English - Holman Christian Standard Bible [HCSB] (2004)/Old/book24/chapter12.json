  "1": "You will be righteous, LORD, even if I bring a case against You. Yet, I wish to contend with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? [Why] do the treacherous live at ease?",
  "2": "You planted them, and they have taken root. They have grown and produced fruit. You are ever on their lips, but far from their conscience.",
  "3": "As for You, You know me, LORD; You see me. You test whether my heart is with You. Drag the wicked away like sheep to slaughter, and set them apart for the day of killing.",
  "4": "How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the evil of its residents, animals and birds have been swept away, for [the people] have said, \"He cannot see what our end will be.\"",
  "5": "If you have raced with runners and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, what will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?",
  "6": "Even your brothers-- your own father's household-- even they were treacherous to you; even they have cried out loudly after you. Do not have confidence in them, though they speak well of you.",
  "7": "I have abandoned My house; I have deserted My inheritance. I have given the love of My life into the hand of her enemies.",
  "8": "My inheritance has acted toward Me like a lion in the forest. She has roared against Me. Therefore, I hate her.",
  "9": "Is My inheritance like a hyena to Me? Are birds of prey circling her? Go, gather all the wild animals; bring them to devour [her].",
  "10": "Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My plot of land. They have turned My desirable plot into a desolate wasteland.",
  "11": "They have made it a desolation. It mourns, desolate, before Me. All the land is desolate, but no one takes it to heart.",
  "12": "Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come, for the LORD has a sword that devours from one end of the earth to the other. No one has peace.",
  "13": "They have sown wheat but harvested thorns. They have exhausted themselves but have no profit. Be put to shame by your harvests because of the LORD's burning anger.",
  "14": "This is what the LORD says: \"Concerning all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people, Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.",
  "15": "After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land.",
  "16": "If they will diligently learn the ways of My people-- to swear by My name, 'As the LORD lives,' just as they taught My people to swear by Baal-- they will be built up among My people.",
  "17": "However, if they will not obey, then I will uproot and destroy that nation.\" [This is] the LORD's declaration."
