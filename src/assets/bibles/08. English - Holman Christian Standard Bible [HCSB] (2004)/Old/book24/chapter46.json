  "10": "That day belongs to the Lord, the God of Hosts, a day of vengeance to avenge Himself against His adversaries.

  "16": "He continues to stumble. Indeed, each falls over the other. They say: Get up! Let's return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword that oppresses.",
  "17": "There they will cry out: Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise; he let the opportune moment pass.",
  "18": "As I live-- [this is] the King's declaration; the LORD of Hosts is His name. He will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.",
  "19": "Pack your bags for exile, inhabitant of Daughter Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolation, uninhabited ruins.",
  "20": "Egypt is a beautiful young cow, but a horsefly from the north is coming against her.",
  "21": "Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves. They too will turn back; together they will flee; they will not take their stand, for the day of their calamity is coming on them, the time of their punishment.",
  "22": "Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake, for [the enemy] will come with an army; with axes they will come against her like those who cut trees.",

  "28": "And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, but I will by no means leave you unpunished."
