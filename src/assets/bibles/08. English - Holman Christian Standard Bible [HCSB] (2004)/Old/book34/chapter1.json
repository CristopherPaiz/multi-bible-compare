  "1": "The oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.",
  "2": "The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is fierce in wrath. The LORD takes vengeance against His foes; He is furious with His enemies.",
  "3": "The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will never leave [the guilty] unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.",
  "4": "He rebukes the sea so that it dries up, and He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; even the flower of Lebanon withers.",
  "5": "The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; the earth tremblesat His presence-- the world and all who live in it.",
  "6": "Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, even rocks are shattered before Him.",
  "7": "The LORD is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; He cares for those who take refuge in Him.",
  "8": "But He will completely destroy Nineveh with an overwhelming flood, and He will chase His enemies into darkness.",
  "9": "Whatever you plot against the Lord, He will bring [it] to complete destruction; oppression will not rise up a second time.",
  "10": "For they will be consumed like entangled thorns, like a drunkard's drink, and like straw that is fully dry.",
  "11": "One has gone out from Nineveh, who plots evil against the LORD, and is a wicked counselor.",
  "12": "This is what the LORD says: Though they are strong and numerous, they will still be mowed down, and he will pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer.",
  "13": "For I will now break off his yoke from you and tear off your shackles.",
  "14": "The LORD has issued an order concerning you: There will be no offspring to carry on your name. I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.",
  "15": "Look to the mountains-- the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out."
