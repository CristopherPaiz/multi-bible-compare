  "22": "you should tell your children, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'",
  "23": "For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.",
  "24": "This is so that all the people of the earth may know that the LORD's hand is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.\""
