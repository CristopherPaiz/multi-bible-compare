  "3": "I have given you every place where the sole of your foot treads, just as I promised Moses.",
  "4": "Your territory will be from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great Euphrates River-- all the land of the Hittites-- and west to the Mediterranean Sea.",
  "5": "No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will not leave you or forsake you.",
  "6": "\"Be strong and courageous, for you will distribute the land I swore to their fathers to give them as an inheritance.",
  "7": "Above all, be strong and very courageous to carefully observe the whole instruction My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or the left, so that you will have success wherever you go.",
  "8": "This book of instruction must not depart from your mouth; you are to recite it day and night, so that you may carefully observe everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do.",

  "14": "Your wives, young children, and livestock may remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But your fighting men must cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers and help them",
  "15": "until the LORD gives our brothers rest, as [He has given] you, and they too possess the land the LORD your God is giving them. You may then return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of what Moses the LORD's servant gave you on the east side of the Jordan.\"",
  "16": "They answered Joshua, \"Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go.",
  "17": "We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.",
  "18": "Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words in all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!\""
