  "1": "A long time after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, Joshua was old, getting on in years.",
  "2": "So Joshua summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers, and said to them, \"I am old, getting on in years,",
  "3": "and you have seen for yourselves everything the LORD your God did to all these nations on your account, because it was the LORD your God who was fighting for you.",
  "4": "See, I have allotted these remaining nations to you as an inheritance for your tribes, including all the nations I have destroyed, from the Jordan westward to the Mediterranean Sea.",
  "5": "The LORD your God will force them back on your account and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you.",
  "6": "\"Be very strong, and continue obeying all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you do not turn from it to the right or left",

  "14": "\"I am now going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and all your soul that none of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.",
  "15": "Since every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come about, so He will bring on you every bad thing until He has annihilated you from this good land the LORD your God has given you.",
  "16": "If you break the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and worship other gods, and bow down to them, the LORD's anger will burn against you, and you will quickly disappear from this good land He has given you.\""
