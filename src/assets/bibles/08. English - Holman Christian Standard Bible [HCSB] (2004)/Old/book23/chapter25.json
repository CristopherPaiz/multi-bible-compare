  "1": "LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You. I will praise Your name, for You have accomplished wonders, plans [formed] long ago, with perfect faithfulness.",
  "2": "For You have turned the city into a pile of rubble, a fortified city, into a ruin; the fortress of barbarians is no longer a city; it will never be rebuilt.",
  "3": "Therefore, a strong people will honor You. A city of violent people will fear You.",
  "4": "For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the humble person in his distress, a refuge from the rain, a shade from the heat. When the breath of the violent is like rain [against] a wall,",
  "5": "like heat in a dry land, You subdue the uproar of barbarians. As the shade of a cloud [cools] the heat of the day, [so] He stills the song of the violent.",
  "6": "The LORD of Hosts will prepare a feast for all the peoples on this mountain-- a feast of aged wine, choice meat, finely aged wine.",
  "7": "On this mountain [He] will destroy the [burial] shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations;",
  "8": "He will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away the tears from every face and remove His people's disgrace from the whole earth, for the LORD has spoken.",
  "9": "On that day it will be said, \"Look, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.\"",
  "10": "For the LORD's power will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trampled in a dung pile.",
  "11": "He will spread out his arms in the middle of it, as a swimmer spreads out [his arms] to swim. His pride will be brought low, along with the trickery of his hands.",
  "12": "The high-walled fortress will be brought down, thrown to the ground, to the dust."
