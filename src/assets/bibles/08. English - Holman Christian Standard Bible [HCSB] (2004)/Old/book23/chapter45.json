  "3": "I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches from secret places, so that you may know that I, the LORD, the God of Israel call you by your name.",
  "4": "I call you by your name, because of Jacob My servant and Israel My chosen one. I give a name to you, though you do not know Me.",
  "5": "I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God but Me. I will strengthen you, though you do not know Me,",
  "6": "so that all may know from the rising of the sun to its setting that there is no one but Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other.",
  "7": "I form light and create darkness, I make success and create disaster; I, the LORD, do all these things.",
  "8": "\"Heavens, sprinkle from above, and let the skies shower righteousness. Let the earth open up that salvation sprout and righteousness spring up with it. I, the LORD, have created it.",
  "9": "\"Woe to the one who argues with his Maker-- one clay pot among many. Does clay say to the one forming it: What are you making? Or does your work [say]: He has no hands?",

  "15": "Yes, You are a God who hides Himself, God of Israel, Savior.",
  "16": "All of them are put to shame, even humiliated; the makers of idols go in humiliation together.",
  "17": "Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will not be put to shame or humiliated for all eternity.",
  "18": "For this is what the LORD says-- God is the Creator of the heavens. He formed the earth and made it; He established it; He did not create it to be empty, [but] formed it to be inhabited-- \"I am the LORD, and there is no other.",
