  "1": "The Spirit of the Lord God is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and freedom to the prisoners;",
  "2": "to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of our God's vengeance; to comfort all who mourn,",
  "3": "to provide for those who mourn in Zion; to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, festive oil instead of mourning, and splendid clothes instead of despair. And they will be called righteous trees, planted by the LORD, to glorify Him.",
  "4": "They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the former devastations; they will renew the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.",
  "5": "Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.",
  "6": "But you will be called the LORD's priests; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their riches.",
  "7": "Because your shame was double, and they cried out, \"Disgrace is their portion,\" therefore, they will possess double in their land, and eternal joy will be theirs.",
  "8": "For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and injustice; I will faithfully reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.",
  "9": "Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their posterity among the peoples. All who see them will recognize that they are a people the LORD has blessed.",
  "10": "I greatly rejoice in the LORD, I exult in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom wears a turban and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.",
  "11": "For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations."
