  "1": "An oracle against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:",
  "2": "Lift up a banner on a barren mountain. Call out to them. Wave your hand, and they will go through the gates of the nobles.",
  "3": "I have commanded My chosen ones; I have also called My warriors, who exult in My triumph, to execute My wrath.",
  "4": "Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a mighty people! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations being gathered together! The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing an army for war.",
  "5": "They are coming from a far land, from the distant horizon-- the LORD and the weapons of His wrath-- to destroy the whole country.",
  "6": "Wail! For the day of the LORD is near. It will come like destruction from the Almighty.",
  "7": "Therefore everyone's hands will become weak, and every man's heart will melt.",
  "8": "They will be horrified; pain and agony will seize [them]; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look at each other, their faces flushed with fear.",
  "9": "Look, the day of the LORD is coming-- cruel, with rage and burning anger-- to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners on it.",
  "10": "Indeed, the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will not shine.",
  "11": "I will bring disaster on the world, and their [own] iniquity, on the wicked. I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant and humiliate the insolence of tyrants.",
  "12": "I will make man scarcer than gold, and mankind more rare than the gold of Ophir.",
  "13": "Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will shake from its foundations at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts, on the day of His burning anger.",
  "14": "Like wandering gazelles and like sheep without a shepherd, each one will turn to his own people, each one will flee to his own land.",
  "15": "Whoever is found will be stabbed, and whoever is caught will die by the sword.",
  "16": "Their children will be smashed [to death] before their eyes; their houses will be looted, and their wives raped.",
  "17": "Look! I am stirring up the Medes against them, who cannot be bought off with silver and who have no desire for gold.",
  "18": "[Their] bows will cut young men to pieces. They will have no compassion on little ones; they will not look with pity on children.",
  "19": "And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.",
  "20": "It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; a nomad will not pitch his tent there, and shepherds will not let [their flocks] rest there.",
  "21": "But wild animals will lie down there, and owls will fill the houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.",
  "22": "Hyenas will howl in the fortresses, and jackals, in the luxurious palaces. Babylon's time is almost up; her days are almost over."
