  "1": "You nations, come here and listen; you peoples, pay attention! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it, the world and all that comes from it.",
  "2": "The LORD is angry with all the nations-- furious with all their armies. He will set them apart for destruction, giving them over to slaughter.",
  "3": "Their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains flow with their blood.",
  "4": "All the heavenly bodies will dissolve. The skies will roll up like a scroll, and their stars will all wither as leaves wither on the vine, and foliage on the fig tree.",
  "5": "When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens it will then come down on Edom and on the people I have set apart for destruction.",
  "6": "The LORD's sword is covered with blood. It drips with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.",
  "7": "The wild oxen will be struck down with them, and young bulls with the mighty bulls. Their land will be soaked with blood, and their soil will be saturated with fat.",
  "8": "For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a time of paying back [Edom] for its hostility against Zion.",
  "9": "[Edom's] streams will be turned into pitch, her soil into sulfur; her land will become burning pitch.",
  "10": "It will never go out-- day or night. Its smoke will go up forever. It will be desolate, from generation to generation; no one will pass through it forever and ever.",
  "11": "The desert owl and the hedgehog will possess it, and the great owl and the raven will dwell there. [The LORD] will stretch out a measuring line and a plumb line over her for [her] destruction and chaos.",
  "12": "No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing.",
  "13": "Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns; her fortified cities, with thistles and briers. She will become a dwelling for jackals, an abode for ostriches.",
  "14": "The wild beasts will meet hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. Indeed, the screech owl will stay there and will find a resting place for herself.",
  "15": "The sand partridge will make her nest there; she will lay and hatch her eggs and will gather [her brood] under her shadow. Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there, each with its mate.",
  "16": "Search and read the scroll of the LORD: Not one of them will be missing, none will be lacking its mate, because He has ordered it by my mouth, and He will gather them by His Spirit.",
  "17": "He has ordained a lot for them; His hand allotted their portion with a measuring line. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation."
