  "1": "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and His robe filled the temple.",
  "2": "Seraphim were standing above Him; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.",
  "3": "And one called to another: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; His glory fills the whole earth.",
  "4": "The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke.",
  "5": "Then I said: Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips, [and] because my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.",
  "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs.",
  "7": "He touched my mouth [with it] and said: Now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, and your sin is atoned for.",
  "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: Who should I send? Who will go for Us? I said: Here I am. Send me.",
  "9": "And He replied: Go! Say to these people: Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looking, but do not perceive.",
  "10": "Dull the minds of these people; deafen their ears and blind their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed.",
  "11": "Then I said, \"Until when, Lord?\" And He replied: Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants, houses are without people, the land is ruined and desolate,",
  "12": "and the LORD drives the people far away, leaving great emptiness in the land.",
  "13": "Though a tenth will remain in the land, it will be burned again. Like the terebinth or the oak, which leaves a stump when felled, the holy seed is the stump."
