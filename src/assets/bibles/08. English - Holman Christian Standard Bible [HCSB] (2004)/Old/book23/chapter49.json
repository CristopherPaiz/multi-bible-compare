  "7": "This is what the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One says to one who is despised, to one abhorred by people, to a servant of rulers: \"Kings will see and stand up, and princes will bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel-- and He has chosen you.\"",
  "8": "This is what the LORD says: I will answer you in a time of favor, and I will help you in the day of salvation. I will keep you, and I will appoint you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land, to make them possess the desolate inheritances,",

  "16": "Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; your walls are continually before Me.",
  "17": "Your builders hurry; those who destroy and devastate you will leave you.",
  "18": "Look up, and look around. They all gather together; they come to you. As I live\"-- the LORD's declaration-- \"you will wear all your children as jewelry, and put them on as a bride does.",
  "19": "For your waste and desolate places and your land marked by ruins-- will now be indeed too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.",
  "20": "The children that you have been deprived of will yet say in your hearing: This place is too small for me; make room for me so that I may settle.",
