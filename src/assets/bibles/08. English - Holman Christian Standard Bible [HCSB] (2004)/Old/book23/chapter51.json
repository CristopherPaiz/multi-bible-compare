  "1": "Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the quarry from which you were dug.",
  "2": "Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain. When I called him, he was only one; I blessed him and made him many.",
  "3": "For the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places, and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and melodious song.",
  "4": "Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation; for instruction will come from Me, and My justice for a light to the nations. I will bring it about quickly.",
  "5": "My righteousness is near, My salvation appears, and My arms will bring justice to the nations. The coastlands will put their hope in Me, and they will look to My strength.",
  "6": "Look up to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its inhabitants will die in like manner. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will never be shattered.",
  "7": "Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My instruction: do not fear disgrace by men, and do not be shattered by their taunts.",
  "8": "For the moth will devour them like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will last forever, and My salvation for all generations.",
  "9": "Wake up, wake up! Put on the strength of the LORD's power. Wake up as in days past, as in generations of long ago. Wasn't it You who hacked Rahab to pieces, who pierced the sea monster?",
  "10": "Wasn't it You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the sea-bed into a road for the redeemed to pass over?",
  "11": "And the ransomed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake [them], and sorrow and sighing will flee.",
  "12": "I-- I am the One who comforts you. Who are you that you should fear man who dies, or a son of man who is given up like grass?",
  "13": "But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You are in constant dread all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, who has set himself to destroy. But where is the fury of the oppressor?",
  "14": "The prisoner is soon to be set free; he will not die [and go] to the Pit, and his food will not be lacking.",
  "15": "For I am the LORD your God who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- His name is Yahweh of Hosts.",
  "16": "I have put My words in your mouth, and covered you in the shadow of My hand, in order to plant the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, \"You are My people.\"",
  "17": "Wake yourself, wake yourself up! Stand up, Jerusalem, you who have drunk the cup of His fury from the hand of the LORD; you who have drunk the goblet to the dregs-- the cup that [causes people] to stagger.",
  "18": "There is no one to guide her among all the children she has raised; there is no one to take hold of her hand among all the offspring she has brought up.",
  "19": "These two things have happened to you: devastation and destruction, famine and sword. Who will grieve for you? How can I comfort you?",
  "20": "Your children have fainted; they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net. They are full of the LORD's fury, the rebuke of your God.",
  "21": "So listen to this, afflicted and drunken one-- but not with wine.",
  "22": "This is what your Lord says-- Yahweh, even your God, who defends His people-- \"Look, I have removed the cup of staggering from your hand; that goblet, the cup of My fury. You will never drink it again.",
  "23": "I will put it into the hands of your tormenters, who said to you: Lie down, so we can walk over you. You made your back like the ground, and like a street for those who walk on it."
