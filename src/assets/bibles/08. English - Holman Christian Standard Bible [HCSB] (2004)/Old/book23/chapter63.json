  "1": "Who is this coming from Edom in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah-- this One who is splendid in His apparel, rising up proudly in His great might? It is I, proclaiming vindication, powerful to save.",
  "2": "Why is Your clothing red, and Your garments like one who treads a winepress?",
  "3": "I trampled the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with Me. I trampled them in My anger and ground them underfoot in My fury; their blood spattered My garments, and all My clothes were stained.",
  "4": "For I planned the day of vengeance, and the year of My redemption came.",
  "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was amazed that no one assisted; so My arm accomplished victory for Me, and My wrath assisted Me.",
  "6": "I crushed nations in My anger; I made them drunk with My wrath and poured out their blood on the ground.",
  "7": "I will make known the LORD's faithful love [and] the LORD's praiseworthy acts, because of all the LORD has done for us-- even the many good things [He has done] for the house of Israel and has done for them based on His compassions and the abundance of His faithful love.",
  "8": "He said, \"They are indeed My people, children who will not be disloyal,\" and He became their Savior.",
  "9": "In all their suffering, He suffered, and the Angel of His Presence saved them. He redeemed them because of His love and compassion; He lifted them up and carried them all the days of the past.",
  "10": "But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He became their enemy [and] fought against them.",
  "11": "Then He remembered the days of the past, [the days] of Moses [and] his people. Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit among the flock?",
  "12": "He sent His glorious arm at Moses' right hand, divided the waters before them to obtain eternal fame for Himself,",
  "13": "and led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble.",
  "14": "Like cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. You led Your people this way to make a glorious name for Yourself.",
  "15": "Look down from heaven and see from Your lofty home-- holy and beautiful. Where is Your zeal and Your might? Your yearning and Your compassion are withheld from me.",
  "16": "Yet You are our Father, even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesn't recognize us. You, LORD, are our Father; from ancient times, Your name is our Redeemer.",
  "17": "Why, LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways? You harden our hearts so we do not fear You. Return, because of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.",
  "18": "Your holy people had a possession for a little while, [but] our enemies have trampled down Your sanctuary.",
  "19": "We have become like those You never ruled over, like those not called by Your name."
