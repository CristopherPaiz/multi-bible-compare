  "2": "I will be with you when you pass through the waters, and [when you pass] through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. You will not be scorched when you walk through the fire, and the flame will not burn you.",

  "5": "Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your descendants from the east, and gather you from the west.",
  "6": "I will say to the north: Give [them] up! and to the south: Do not hold [them] back! Bring My sons from far away, and My daughters from the ends of the earth--",
  "7": "everyone called by My name and created for My glory. I have formed him; indeed, I have made him.\"",
  "8": "Bring out a people who are blind, yet have eyes, and are deaf, yet have ears.",
  "9": "All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled. Who among them can declare this, and tell us the former things? Let them present their witnesses to vindicate [themselves], so that people may hear and say, \"It is true.\"",
  "10": "\"You are My witnesses\"-- the LORD's declaration-- \"and My servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe Me and understand that I am He. No god was formed before Me, and there will be none after Me.",
  "11": "I, I am the LORD, and there is no other Savior but Me.",
  "12": "I alone declared, saved, and proclaimed-- and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses\"-- the LORD's declaration-- \"and I am God.",
  "13": "Also, from today on I am He [alone], and no one can take [anything] from My hand. I act, and who can reverse it?\"",

  "15": "I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.",
  "16": "This is what the LORD says-- who makes a way in the sea, and a path through surging waters,",
  "17": "who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty one together (they lie down, they do not rise again; they are extinguished, quenched like a wick)--",
  "18": "\"Do not remember the past events, pay no attention to things of old.",
  "19": "Look, I am about to do something new; even now it is coming. Do you not see it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.",

  "24": "You have not bought Me aromatic cane with silver, or satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.",
  "25": "\"It is I who sweep away your transgressions for My own sake and remember your sins no more.",
  "26": "Take Me to court; let us argue our case together. State your [case], so that you may be vindicated.",
  "27": "Your first father sinned, and your mediators have rebelled against Me.",
