  "2": "He said to his mother, \"The 1,100 pieces of silver taken from you, and that I heard you utter a curse about-- here, I have the silver with me. I took it. So now I return it to you.\" Then his mother said, \"My son, you are blessed by the LORD!\"",

  "11": "and agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.",
  "12": "Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in Micah's house.",
  "13": "Then Micah said, \"Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest.\""
