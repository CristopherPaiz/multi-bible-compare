  "1": "[A Davidic psalm.] The LORD is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack.",
  "2": "He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.",
  "3": "He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name's sake.",
  "4": "Even when I go through the darkest valley, I fear [no] danger, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff-- they comfort me.",
  "5": "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.",
  "6": "Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD as long as I live."
