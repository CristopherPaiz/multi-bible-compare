  "1": "[A Davidic psalm.] LORD, who can dwell in Your tent? Who can live on Your holy mountain?",
  "2": "The one who lives honestly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart--",
  "3": "who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor,",
  "4": "who despises the one rejected by the LORD, but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his word whatever the cost,",
  "5": "who does not lend his money at interest or take a bribe against the innocent-- the one who does these things will never be moved."
