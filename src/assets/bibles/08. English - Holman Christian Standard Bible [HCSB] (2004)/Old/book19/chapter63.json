  "1": "[A Davidic psalm. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah.] God, You are my God; I eagerly seek You. I thirst for You; my body faints for You in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water.",
  "2": "So I gaze on You in the sanctuary to see Your strength and Your glory.",
  "3": "My lips will glorify You because Your faithful love is better than life.",
  "4": "So I will praise You as long as I live; at Your name, I will lift up my hands.",
  "5": "You satisfy me as with rich food; my mouth will praise You with joyful lips.",
  "6": "When, on my bed, I think of You, I meditate on You during the night watches",
  "7": "because You are my help; I will rejoice in the shadow of Your wings.",
  "8": "I follow close to You; Your right hand holds on to me.",
  "9": "But those who seek to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth.",
  "10": "They will be given over to the power of the sword; they will become the jackals' prey.",
  "11": "But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will boast, for the mouths of liars will be shut."
