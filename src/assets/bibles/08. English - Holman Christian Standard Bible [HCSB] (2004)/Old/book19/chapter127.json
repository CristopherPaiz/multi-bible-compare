  "1": "[A Solomonic song of ascents.] Unless the LORD builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the LORD watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain.",
  "2": "In vain you get up early and stay up late, eating food earned by hard work; certainly He gives sleep to the one He loves.",
  "3": "Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, children, a reward.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one's youth.",
  "5": "Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them. Such men will never be put to shame when they speak with [their] enemies at the city gate."
