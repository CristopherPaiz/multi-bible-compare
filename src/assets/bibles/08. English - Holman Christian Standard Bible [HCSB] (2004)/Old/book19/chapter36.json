  "1": "[For the choir director. [A psalm] of David, the LORD's servant.] An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked: There is no dread of God before his eyes,",
  "2": "for in his own eyes he flatters himself [too much] to discover and hate his sin.",
  "3": "The words of his mouth are malicious and deceptive; he has stopped acting wisely and doing good.",
  "4": "Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good and does not reject evil.",
  "5": "LORD, Your faithful love [reaches] to heaven, Your faithfulness to the skies.",
  "6": "Your righteousness is like the highest mountain; Your judgments, like the deepest sea. LORD, You preserve man and beast.",
  "7": "God, Your faithful love is so valuable that people take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.",
  "8": "They are filled from the abundance of Your house; You let them drink from Your refreshing stream,",
  "9": "for with You is life's fountain. In Your light we will see light.",
  "10": "Spread Your faithful love over those who know You, and Your righteousness over the upright in heart.",
  "11": "Do not let the foot of the arrogant come near me or the hand of the wicked drive me away.",
  "12": "There the evildoers fall; they have been thrown down and cannot rise."
