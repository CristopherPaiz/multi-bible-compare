  "1": "[For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] I waited patiently for the LORD, and He turned to me and heard my cry for help.",
  "2": "He brought me up from a desolate pit, out of the muddy clay, and set my feet on a rock, making my steps secure.",
  "3": "He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.",
  "4": "How happy is the man who has put his trust in the LORD and has not turned to the proud or to those who run after lies!",
  "5": "LORD my God, You have done many things-- Your wonderful works and Your plans for us; none can compare with You. If I were to report and speak [of them], they are more than can be told.",
  "6": "You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; You open my ears to listen. You do not ask for a whole burnt offering or a sin offering.",
  "7": "Then I said, \"See, I have come; it is written about me in the volume of the scroll.",
  "8": "I delight to do Your will, my God; Your instruction resides within me.\"",
  "9": "I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; see, I do not keep my mouth closed-- as You know, LORD.",
  "10": "I did not hide Your righteousness in my heart; I spoke about Your faithfulness and salvation; I did not conceal Your constant love and truth from the great assembly.",
  "11": "LORD, do not withhold Your compassion from me; Your constant love and truth will always guard me.",
  "12": "For troubles without number have surrounded me; my sins have overtaken me; I am unable to see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my courage leaves me.",
  "13": "LORD, be pleased to deliver me; hurry to help me, LORD.",
  "14": "Let those who seek to take my life be disgraced and confounded. Let those who wish me harm be driven back and humiliated.",
  "15": "Let those who say to me, \"Aha, aha!\" be horrified because of their shame.",
  "16": "Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; let those who love Your salvation continually say, The LORD is great!\"",
  "17": "I am afflicted and needy; the Lord thinks of me. You are my help and my deliverer; my God, do not delay."
