  "1": "[For the choir director: according to \"The Lilies.\" A testimony of Asaph. A psalm.] Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who guides Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned [on] the cherubim, rise up",
  "2": "at the head of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your power and come to save us.",
  "3": "Restore us, God; look [on us] with favor, and we will be saved.",

  "16": "It was cut down and burned up; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.",
