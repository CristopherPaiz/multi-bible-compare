  "1": "[For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A Davidic psalm.] I said, \"I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are in my presence.\"",
  "2": "I was speechless and quiet; I kept silent, even from [speaking] good, and my pain intensified.",
  "3": "My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, a fire burned. I spoke with my tongue:",
  "4": "\"LORD, reveal to me the end of my life and the number of my days. Let me know how transitory I am.",
  "5": "You, indeed, have made my days short in length, and my life span as nothing in Your sight. Yes, every mortal man is only a vapor. Selah",
  "6": "Certainly, man walks about like a mere shadow. Indeed, they frantically rush around in vain, gathering possessions without knowing who will get them.",
  "7": "\"Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.",
  "8": "Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the taunt of fools.",
  "9": "I am speechless; I do not open my mouth because of what You have done.",
  "10": "Remove Your torment from me; I fade away because of the force of Your hand.",
  "11": "You discipline a man with punishment for sin, consuming like a moth what is precious to him; every man is a mere vapor. Selah",
  "12": "\"Hear my prayer, LORD, and listen to my cry for help; do not be silent at my tears. For I am a foreigner residing with You, a sojourner like all my fathers.",
  "13": "Turn Your angry gaze from me so that I may be cheered up before I die and am gone.\""
