  "1": "[For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] LORD, You have searched me and known me.",
  "2": "You know when I sit down and when I stand up; You understand my thoughts from far away.",
  "3": "You observe my travels and my rest; You are aware of all my ways.",
  "4": "Before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, LORD.",
  "5": "You have encircled me; You have placed Your hand on me.",
  "6": "[This] extraordinary knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to [reach] it.",
  "7": "Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?",
  "8": "If I go up to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.",
  "9": "If I live at the eastern horizon [or] settle at the western limits,",
  "10": "even there Your hand will lead me; Your right hand will hold on to me.",
  "11": "If I say, \"Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light around me will become night\"--",
  "12": "even the darkness is not dark to You. The night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to You.",
  "13": "For it was You who created my inward parts; You knit me together in my mother's womb.",
  "14": "I will praise You, because I have been remarkably and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, and I know [this] very well.",
  "15": "My bones were not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was formed in the depths of the earth.",

  "18": "If I counted them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; when I wake up, I am still with You.",
  "19": "God, if only You would kill the wicked-- you bloodthirsty men, stay away from me--",
  "20": "who invoke You deceitfully. Your enemies swear [by You] falsely.",
  "21": "LORD, don't I hate those who hate You, and detest those who rebel against You?",
  "22": "I hate them with extreme hatred; I consider them my enemies.",
  "23": "Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.",
  "24": "See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the everlasting way."
