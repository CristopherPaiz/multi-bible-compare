  "1": "[A Davidic psalm.] LORD, I call on You; hurry to [help] me. Listen to my voice when I call on You.",
  "2": "May my prayer be set before You as incense, the raising of my hands as the evening offering.",
  "3": "LORD, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing or wickedly perform reckless acts with men who commit sin. Do not let me feast on their delicacies.",
  "5": "Let the righteous one strike me-- it is [an act of] faithful love; let him rebuke me-- it is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. Even now my prayer is against the evil acts of the wicked.",
  "6": "When their rulers will be thrown off the sides of a cliff, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasing.",
  "7": "As when one plows and breaks up the soil, [turning up rocks], so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.",

  "9": "Protect me from the trap they have set for me, and from the snares of evildoers.",
