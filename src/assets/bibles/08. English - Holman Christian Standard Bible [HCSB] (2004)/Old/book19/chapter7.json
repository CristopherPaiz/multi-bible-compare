  "1": "[A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite.] LORD my God, I seek refuge in You; save me from all my pursuers and rescue me,",
  "2": "or they will tear me like a lion, ripping me apart, with no one to rescue me.",
  "3": "LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is injustice on my hands,",
  "4": "if I have done harm to one at peace with me or have plundered my adversary without cause,",
  "5": "may an enemy pursue and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah",
  "6": "Rise up, LORD, in Your anger; lift Yourself up against the fury of my adversaries; awake for me; You have ordained a judgment.",
  "7": "Let the assembly of peoples gather around You; take Your seat on high over it.",
  "8": "The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity.",
  "9": "Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous. The One who examines the thoughts and emotions is a righteous God.",
  "10": "My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.",
  "11": "God is a righteous judge, and a God who executes justice every day.",
  "12": "If anyone does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has strung His bow and made it ready.",
  "13": "He has prepared His deadly weapons; He tips His arrows with fire.",
  "14": "See, he is pregnant with evil, conceives trouble, and gives birth to deceit.",
  "15": "He dug a pit and hollowed it out, but fell into the hole he had made.",
  "16": "His trouble comes back on his own head, and his violence falls on the top of his head.",
  "17": "I will thank the LORD for His righteousness; I will sing about the name of the LORD, the Most High."
