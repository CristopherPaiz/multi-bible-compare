  "9": "Be gracious to me, LORD, because I am in distress; my eyes are worn out from angry sorrow-- my whole being as well.",
  "10": "Indeed, my life is consumed with grief, and my years with groaning; my strength has failed because of my sinfulness, and my bones waste away.",
  "11": "I am ridiculed by all my adversaries and even by my neighbors. I am an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street run from me.",
