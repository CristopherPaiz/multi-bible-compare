  "1": "[A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] The LORD is great and is highly praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,",
  "2": "rising splendidly, is the joy of the whole earth. Mount Zion on the slopes of the north is the city of the great King.",
  "3": "God is known as a stronghold in its citadels.",
  "4": "Look! The kings assembled; they advanced together.",
  "5": "They looked, and froze with fear; they fled in terror.",
  "6": "Trembling seized them there, agony like that of a woman in labor,",
  "7": "as You wrecked the ships of Tarshish with the east wind.",
  "8": "Just as we heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it forever. Selah",
  "9": "God, within Your temple, we contemplate Your faithful love.",
  "10": "Your name, God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with justice.",
  "11": "Mount Zion is glad. The towns of Judah rejoice because of Your judgments.",
  "12": "Go around Zion, encircle it; count its towers,",
  "13": "note its ramparts; tour its citadels so that you can tell a future generation:",
  "14": "\"This God, our God forever and ever-- He will lead us eternally.\""
