  "1": "[A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.] LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out before You day and night.",
  "2": "May my prayer reach Your presence; listen to my cry.",
  "3": "For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol.",
  "4": "I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength,",
  "5": "abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom You no longer remember, and who are cut off from Your care.",
  "6": "You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths.",
  "7": "Your wrath weighs heavily on me; You have overwhelmed me with all Your waves. Selah",
  "8": "You have distanced my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out.",
  "9": "My eyes are worn out from crying. LORD, I cry out to You all day long; I spread out my hands to You.",
  "10": "Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah",
  "11": "Will Your faithful love be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?",
  "12": "Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?",
  "13": "But I call to You for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer meets You.",
  "14": "LORD, why do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?",
  "15": "From my youth, I have been afflicted and near death. I suffer Your horrors; I am desperate.",
  "16": "Your wrath sweeps over me; Your terrors destroy me.",
  "17": "They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side.",
  "18": "You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my [only] friend."
