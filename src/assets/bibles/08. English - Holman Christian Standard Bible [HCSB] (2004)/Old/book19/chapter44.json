  "1": "[For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.] God, we have heard with our ears-- our forefathers have told us-- the work You accomplished in their days, in days long ago:",
  "2": "to plant them, You drove out the nations with Your hand; to settle them, You crushed the peoples.",
  "3": "For they did not take the land by their sword-- their arm did not bring them victory-- but by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, for You were pleased with them.",
  "4": "You are my King, my God, who ordains victories for Jacob.",
  "5": "Through You we drive back our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.",
  "6": "For I do not trust in my bow, and my sword does not bring me victory.",
  "7": "But You give us victory over our foes and let those who hate us be disgraced.",
  "8": "We boast in God all day long; we will praise Your name forever. Selah",
  "9": "But You have rejected and humiliated us; You do not march out with our armies.",
  "10": "You make us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have taken plunder for themselves.",
  "11": "You hand us over to be eaten like sheep and scatter us among the nations.",
  "12": "You sell Your people for nothing; You make no profit from selling them.",
  "13": "You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.",
  "14": "You make us a joke among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.",
  "15": "My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face,",
  "16": "because of the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy and avenger.",
  "17": "All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.",
  "18": "Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.",
  "19": "But You have crushed us in a haunt of jackals and have covered us with deepest darkness.",
  "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god,",
  "21": "wouldn't God have found this out, since He knows the secrets of the heart?",
  "22": "Because of You we are slain all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.",
  "23": "Wake up, LORD! Why are You sleeping? Get up! Don't reject us forever!",
  "24": "Why do You hide Yourself and forget our affliction and oppression?",
  "25": "For we have sunk down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.",
  "26": "Rise up! Help us! Redeem us because of Your faithful love."
