  "1": "[For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] God, hear my voice when I complain. Protect my life from the terror of the enemy.",
  "2": "Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of evildoers,",
  "3": "who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim bitter words like arrows,",
  "4": "shooting from concealed places at the innocent. They shoot at him suddenly and are not afraid.",
  "5": "They encourage each other in an evil plan; they talk about hiding traps and say, \"Who will see them?\"",
  "6": "They devise crimes [and say,] \"We have perfected a secret plan.\" The inner man and the heart are mysterious.",
  "7": "But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly, they will be wounded.",
  "8": "They will be made to stumble; their own tongues work against them. All who see them will shake their heads.",
  "9": "Then everyone will fear and will tell about God's work, for they will understand what He has done.",
  "10": "The righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; all the upright in heart offer praise."
