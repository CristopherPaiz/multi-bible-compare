  "1": "[For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] LORD, how long will You continually forget me? How long will You hide Your face from me?",
  "2": "How long will I store up anxious concerns within me, agony in my mind every day? How long will my enemy dominate me?",
  "3": "Consider me and answer, LORD, my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death,",
  "4": "my enemy will say, \"I have triumphed over him,\" and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.",
  "5": "But I have trusted in Your faithful love; my heart will rejoice in Your deliverance.",
  "6": "I will sing to the LORD because He has treated me generously."
