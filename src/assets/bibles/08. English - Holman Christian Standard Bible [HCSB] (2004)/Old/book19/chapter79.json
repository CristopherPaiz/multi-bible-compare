  "1": "[A psalm of Asaph.] God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, desecrated Your holy temple, and turned Jerusalem into ruins.",
  "2": "They gave the corpses of Your servants to the birds of the sky for food, the flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.",
  "3": "They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury [them].",
  "4": "We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.",
  "5": "How long, LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy keep burning like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don't acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that don't call on Your name,",
  "7": "for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.",
  "8": "Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come to us quickly, for we have become weak.",
  "9": "God of our salvation, help us-- for the glory of Your name. Deliver us and atone for our sins, because of Your name.",
  "10": "Why should the nations ask, \"Where is their God?\" Before our eyes, let vengeance for the shed blood of Your servants be known among the nations.",
  "11": "Let the groans of the prisoners reach You; according to Your great power, preserve those condemned to die.",
  "12": "Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors the reproach they have hurled at You, Lord.",
  "13": "Then we, Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; we will declare Your praise to generation after generation."
