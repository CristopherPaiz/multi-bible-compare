  "1": "[A Davidic song of ascents.] LORD, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too difficult for me.",
  "2": "Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself like a little weaned child with its mother; I am like a little child.",
  "3": "Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forever."
