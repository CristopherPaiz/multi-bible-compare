  "1": "[For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky proclaims the work of His hands.",
  "2": "Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge.",
  "3": "There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard.",
  "4": "Their message has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the inhabited world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.",
  "5": "It is like a groom coming from the bridal chamber; it rejoices like an athlete running a course.",
  "6": "It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat.",
  "7": "The instruction of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise.",
  "8": "The precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the commandment of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up.",
  "9": "The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are reliable and altogether righteous.",
  "10": "They are more desirable than gold-- than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey-- than honey dripping from the comb.",
  "11": "In addition, Your servant is warned by them; there is great reward in keeping them.",
  "12": "Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.",
  "13": "Moreover, keep Your servant from willful sins; do not let them rule over me. Then I will be innocent, and cleansed from blatant rebellion.",
  "14": "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to You, LORD, my rock and my Redeemer."
