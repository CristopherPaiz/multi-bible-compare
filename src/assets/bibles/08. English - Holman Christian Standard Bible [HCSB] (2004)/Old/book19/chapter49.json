  "1": "[For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who inhabit the world,",
  "2": "both low and high, rich and poor together.",
  "3": "My mouth speaks wisdom; my heart's meditation [brings] understanding.",
  "4": "I turn my ear to a proverb; I explain my riddle with a lyre.",
  "5": "Why should I fear in times of trouble? The iniquity of my foes surrounds me.",
  "6": "They trust in their wealth and boast of their abundant riches.",
  "7": "Yet these cannot redeem a person or pay his ransom to God--",
  "8": "since the price of redeeming him is too costly, one should forever stop trying--",
  "9": "so that he may live forever and not see the Pit.",
  "10": "For one can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless also pass away. Then they leave their wealth to others.",
  "11": "Their graves are their eternal homes, their homes from generation to generation, though they have named estates after themselves.",
  "12": "But despite [his] assets, man will not last; he is like the animals that perish.",
  "13": "This is the way of those who are arrogant, and of their followers, who approve of their words. Selah",
  "14": "Like sheep they are headed for Sheol; Death will shepherd them. The upright will rule over them in the morning, and their form will waste away in Sheol, far from their lofty abode.",
  "15": "But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol, for He will take me. Selah",
  "16": "Do not be afraid when a man gets rich, when the wealth of his house increases.",
  "17": "For when he dies, he will take nothing at all; his wealth will not follow him down.",
  "18": "Though he praises himself during his lifetime-- and people praise you when you do well for yourself--",
  "19": "he will go to the generation of his fathers; they will never see the light.",
  "20": "A man with valuable possessions but without understanding is like the animals that perish."
