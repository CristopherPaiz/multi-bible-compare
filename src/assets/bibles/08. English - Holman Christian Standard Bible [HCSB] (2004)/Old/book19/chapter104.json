  "1": "My soul, praise the LORD! LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with majesty and splendor.",
  "2": "He wraps Himself in light as if it were a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy,",
  "3": "laying the beams of His palace on the waters [above], making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind,",
  "4": "and making the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.",
  "5": "He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken.",
  "6": "You covered it with the deep as if it were a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.",
  "7": "At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away--",
  "8": "mountains rose and valleys sank-- to the place You established for them.",
  "9": "You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never cover the earth again.",
  "10": "He causes the springs to gush into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.",
  "11": "They supply water for every wild beast; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.",
  "12": "The birds of the sky live beside [the springs]; they sing among the foliage.",
  "13": "He waters the mountains from His palace; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of Your labor.",
  "14": "He causes grass to grow for the livestock and [provides] crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth,",
  "15": "wine that makes man's heart glad-- making his face shine with oil-- and bread that sustains man's heart.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD flourish, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.",
  "17": "There the birds make their nests; the stork makes its home in the pine trees.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.",
  "19": "He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.",
  "20": "You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals stir.",
  "21": "The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.",
  "22": "The sun rises; they go back and lie down in their dens.",
  "23": "Man goes out to his work and to his labor until evening.",
  "24": "How countless are Your works, LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.",
  "25": "Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small.",
  "26": "There the ships move about, and Leviathan, which You formed to play there.",
  "27": "All of them wait for You to give them their food at the right time.",
  "28": "When You give it to them, they gather it; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.",
  "29": "When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.",
  "30": "When You send Your breath, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.",
  "31": "May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.",
  "32": "He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live.",
  "34": "May my meditation be pleasing to Him; I will rejoice in the LORD.",
  "35": "May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. My soul, praise the LORD! Hallelujah!"
