  "1": "[A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.] It is good to praise the LORD, to sing praise to Your name, Most High,",
  "2": "to declare Your faithful love in the morning and Your faithfulness at night,",
  "3": "with a ten-stringed harp and the music of a lyre.",
  "4": "For You have made me rejoice, LORD, by what You have done; I will shout for joy because of the works of Your hands.",
  "5": "How magnificent are Your works, LORD, how profound Your thoughts!",
  "6": "A stupid person does not know, a fool does not understand this:",
  "7": "though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be eternally destroyed.",
  "8": "But You, LORD, are exalted forever.",
  "9": "For indeed, LORD, Your enemies-- indeed, Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.",
  "10": "You have lifted up my horn like that of a wild ox; I have been anointed with oil.",
  "11": "My eyes look down on my enemies; my ears hear evildoers when they attack me.",
  "12": "The righteous thrive like a palm tree and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon.",
  "13": "Planted in the house of the LORD, they thrive in the courtyards of our God.",
  "14": "They will still bear fruit in old age, healthy and green,",
  "15": "to declare: \"The LORD is just; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.\""
