  "1": "God, with his mercy, gave us this work to do, so we don't give up.",
  "2": "But we have turned away from secret and shameful ways. We don't use trickery, and we don't change the teaching of God. We teach the truth plainly. This is how we show people who we are. And this is how they can know in their hearts what kind of people we are before God.",
  "3": "The Good News that we tell people may be hidden, but it is hidden only to those who are lost.",
  "4": "The ruler of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe. They cannot see the light of the Good Newsâ€” the message about the divine greatness of Christ. Christ is the one who is exactly like God.",

  "14": "God raised the Lord Jesus from death, and we know that he will also raise us with Jesus. God will bring us together with you, and we will stand before him.",
  "15": "All these things are for you. And so the grace of God is being given to more and more people. This will bring more and more thanks to God for his glory.",
  "16": "That is why we never give up. Our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day.",
  "17": "We have small troubles for a while now, but these troubles are helping us gain an eternal glory. That eternal glory is much greater than our troubles.",
  "18": "So we think about what we cannot see, not what we see. What we see lasts only a short time, and what we cannot see will last forever."
