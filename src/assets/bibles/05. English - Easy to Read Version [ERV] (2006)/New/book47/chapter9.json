  "1": "I really don't need to write to you about this help for God's people.",
  "2": "I know that you want to help. I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia. I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year. And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also.",
  "3": "But I am sending the brothers to you. I don't want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing. I want you to be ready just as I said you would be.",
  "4": "If any of those from Macedonia come with me, and they find that you are not ready, we will be ashamed. We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you. And you will be ashamed too!",
  "5": "So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do. They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised. Then it will be ready when we come, and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving, not as something you were forced to do.",
  "6": "Remember this: The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest. But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest.",
  "7": "Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give. You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give. God loves those who are happy to give.",
  "8": "And God can give you more blessings than you need, and you will always have plenty of everything. You will have enough to give to every good work.",
  "9": "As the Scriptures say, \"He gives generously to the poor; his goodness will continue forever.\"",
  "10": "God is the one who gives seed to those who plant, and he gives bread for food. And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow. He will produce a great harvest from your goodness.",
  "11": "God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely. And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God.",
  "12": "The service you are offering helps God's people with their needs, but that is not all it does. It is also bringing more and more thanks to God.",
  "13": "This service is a proof of your faith, and people will praise God because of it. They will praise him because you are following the message about Christ—the message you say you believe. They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people.",
  "14": "And when they pray, they will wish they could be with you. They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you.",
  "15": "Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe."
