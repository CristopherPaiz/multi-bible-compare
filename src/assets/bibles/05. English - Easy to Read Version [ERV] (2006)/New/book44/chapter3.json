  "1": "One day Peter and John went to the Temple area. It was three o'clock in the afternoon, which was the time for the daily Temple prayer service.",
  "2": "As they were entering the Temple area, a man was there who had been crippled all his life. He was being carried by some friends who brought him to the Temple every day. They put him by one of the gates outside the Temple. It was called Beautiful Gate. There he begged for money from the people going to the Temple.",
  "3": "That day he saw Peter and John going into the Temple area. He asked them for money.",
  "4": "Peter and John looked at the crippled man and said, \"Look at us!\"",
  "5": "He looked at them; he thought they would give him some money.",
  "6": "But Peter said, \"I don't have any silver or gold, but I do have something else I can give you. By the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth—stand up and walk!\"",
  "7": "Then Peter took the man's right hand and lifted him up. Immediately his feet and legs became strong.",
  "8": "He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk. He went into the Temple area with them. He was walking and jumping and praising God.",
  "9": "All the people recognized him. They knew he was the crippled man who always sat by the Beautiful Gate to beg for money. Now they saw this same man walking and praising God. They were amazed. They did not understand how this could happen.",
  "10": "",
  "11": "The man was holding on to Peter and John. All the people were amazed. They ran to Peter and John at Solomon's Porch.",
  "12": "When Peter saw this, he said to the people, \"My Jewish brothers, why are you surprised at this? You are looking at us as if it was our power that made this man walk. Do you think this was done because we are good?",
  "13": "No, God did it! He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is the God of all our fathers. He gave glory to Jesus, his special servant. But you handed him over to be killed. Pilate decided to let him go free. But you told Pilate you did not want him.",
  "14": "Jesus was holy and good, but you said you did not want him. You told Pilate to give you a murderer instead of Jesus.",
  "15": "And so you killed the one who gives life! But God raised him from death. We are witnesses of this—we saw it with our own eyes.",
  "16": "\"This crippled man was healed because we trusted in Jesus. It was Jesus' power that made him well. You can see this man, and you know him. He was made completely well because of faith in Jesus. You all saw it happen!",
  "17": "\"My brothers, I know that what you did to Jesus was done because you did not understand what you were doing. And your leaders did not understand any more than you did.",
  "18": "But God said these things would happen. Through the prophets he said that his Christ would suffer and die. I have told you how God made this happen.",
  "19": "So you must change your hearts and lives. Come back to God, and he will forgive your sins.",
  "20": "Then the Lord will give you times of spiritual rest. He will send you Jesus, the one he chose to be the Christ.",
  "21": "\"But Jesus must stay in heaven until the time when all things will be made right again. God told about this time when he spoke long ago through his holy prophets.",
  "22": "Moses said, 'The Lord your God will give you a prophet. That prophet will come from among your own people. He will be like me. You must obey everything he tells you.",
  "23": "And anyone who refuses to obey that prophet will die, separated from God's people.'",
  "24": "\"Samuel, and all the other prophets who spoke for God after Samuel, said that this time would come.",
  "25": "And what those prophets talked about is for you, their descendants. You have received the agreement that God made with your fathers. God said to your father Abraham, 'Every nation on earth will be blessed through your descendants.'",
  "26": "God has sent his special servant Jesus. He sent him to you first. He sent him to bless you by causing each of you to turn away from your evil ways.\""
