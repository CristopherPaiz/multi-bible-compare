  "7": "On Sunday we all met together to eat the Lord's Supper. Paul talked to the group. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued talking until midnight.",
  "8": "We were all together in a room upstairs, and there were many lights in the room.",
  "9": "There was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window. Paul continued talking, and Eutychus became very, very sleepy. Finally, he went to sleep and fell out of the window. He fell to the ground from the third floor. When the people went down and lifted him up, he was dead.",
  "10": "Paul went down to where Eutychus was, knelt down beside him, and put his arms around him. He said to the other believers, \"Don't worry. He is alive now.\"",

  "17": "In Miletus Paul sent a message back to Ephesus, telling the elders of the church in Ephesus to come to him.",
  "18": "When they came, Paul said to them, \"You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia. You know the way I lived all the time I was with you.",
  "19": "The Jews planned things against me, and this gave me much trouble. But you know that I always served the Lord, sometimes with tears. I never thought about myself first.",
  "20": "I always did what was best for you. I told you the Good News about Jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes.",
  "21": "I told everyone—Jewish and non- Jewish people—to change and turn to God. I told them all to believe in our Lord Jesus.",
  "22": "\"But now I must obey the Spirit and go to Jerusalem. I don't know what will happen to me there.",
  "23": "I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me.",
  "24": "I don't care about my own life. The most important thing is that I finish my work. I want to finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do—to tell people the Good News about God's grace.",
  "25": "\"And now listen to me. I know that none of you will ever see me again. All the time I was with you, I told you the Good News about God's kingdom.",
  "26": "So today I can tell you one thing that I am sure of: God will not blame me if some of you are not saved.",
  "27": "I can say this because I know that I told you everything that God wants you to know.",
  "28": "Be careful for yourselves and for all the people God has given you. The Holy Spirit gave you the work of caring for this flock. You must be like shepherds to the church of God. This is the church that God bought with his own blood.",
  "29": "I know that after I leave, some men will come into your group. They will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock.",
  "30": "Also, men from your own group will begin to teach things that are wrong. They will lead some of the Lord's followers away from the truth to follow them.",
  "31": "So be careful! And always remember what I did during the three years I was with you. I never stopped reminding each one of you how you should live, counseling you day and night and crying over you.",
  "32": "\"Now I am putting you in God's care. I am depending on the message about his grace to make you strong. That message is able to give you the blessings that God gives to all his holy people.",
  "33": "When I was with you, I never wanted anyone's money or fine clothes.",
  "34": "You know that I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me.",
  "35": "I always showed you that you should work just as I did and help people who are weak. I taught you to remember the words of the Lord Jesus: 'You will have a greater blessing when you give than when you receive.'\"",

  "37": "They cried and cried. They were especially sad because Paul had said they would never see him again. They hugged him and kissed him. Then they went with him to the ship to say goodbye."
