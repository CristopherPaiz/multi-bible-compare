  "4": "Also, there must be no evil talk among you. Don't say things that are foolish or filthy. These are not for you. But you should be giving thanks to God.",
  "5": "You can be sure of this: No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God if that person commits sexual sins, or does evil things, or is a person who selfishly wants more and more. A greedy person like that is serving a false god.",
  "6": "Don't let anyone fool you with words they don't really believe. God gets very angry when people who don't obey him talk like that.",
  "7": "So don't have anything to do with them.",

  "15": "So be very careful how you live. Live wisely, not like fools.",

  "22": "Wives, be willing to serve your husbands the same as the Lord.",
  "23": "A husband is the head of his wife, just as Christ is the head of the church. Christ is the Savior of the church, which is his body.",
  "24": "The church serves under Christ, so it is the same with you wives. You should be willing to serve your husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives the same as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.",
  "26": "He died to make the church holy. He used the telling of the Good News to make the church clean by washing it with water.",

  "28": "And husbands should love their wives like that. They should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself,",

  "30": "because we are parts of his body.",
  "31": "The Scriptures say, \"That is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife, and the two people will become one.\"",
  "32": "That secret truth is very important—I am talking about Christ and the church.",
  "33": "But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself. And a wife must respect her husband."
