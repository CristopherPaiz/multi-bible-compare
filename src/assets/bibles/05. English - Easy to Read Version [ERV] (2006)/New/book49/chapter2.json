  "1": "In the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against God.",
  "2": "Yes, in the past your lives were full of those sins. You lived the way the world lives, following the ruler of the evil powers over the earth. That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God.",
  "3": "In the past all of us lived like that, trying to please our sinful selves. We did all the things our bodies and minds wanted. Like everyone else in the world, we deserved to suffer God's anger just because of the way we were.",
  "4": "But God is rich in mercy, and he loved us very much.",
  "5": "We were spiritually dead because of all we had done against him. But he gave us new life together with Christ. (You have been saved by God's grace. )",
  "6": "Yes, it is because we are a part of Christ Jesus that God raised us from death and seated us together with him in the heavenly places.",
  "7": "God did this so that his kindness to us who belong to Christ Jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace.",

  "17": "Christ came and brought the message of peace to you non- Jews who were far away from God. And he brought that message of peace to those who were near to God.",
  "18": "Yes, through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit.",
  "19": "So now you non-Jewish people are not visitors or strangers, but you are citizens together with God's holy people. You belong to God's family.",
  "20": "You believers are like a building that God owns. That building was built on the foundation that the apostles and prophets prepared. Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone in that building.",
