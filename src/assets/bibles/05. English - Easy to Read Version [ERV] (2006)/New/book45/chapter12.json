  "1": "So I beg you, brothers and sisters, because of the great mercy God has shown us, offer your lives as a living sacrifice to himâ€”an offering that is only for God and pleasing to him. Considering what he has done, it is only right that you should worship him in this way.",
  "2": "Don't change yourselves to be like the people of this world, but let God change you inside with a new way of thinking. Then you will be able to decide and accept what God wants for you. You will be able to know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect.",
  "3": "God has given me a special gift, and that is why I have something to say to each one of you. Don't think that you are better than you really are. You must see yourself just as you are. Decide what you are by the faith God has given each of us.",
  "4": "Each one of us has one body, and that body has many parts. These parts don't all do the same thing.",
