  "1": "Every Jewish high priest is chosen from among men. That priest is given the work of helping people with the things they must do for God. He must offer to God gifts and sacrifices for sins.",
  "2": "The high priest has his own weaknesses. So he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance.",
  "3": "He offers sacrifices for their sins, but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins.",
  "4": "To be a high priest is an honor. But no one chooses himself for this work. That person must be chosen by God just as Aaron was.",
  "5": "It is the same with Christ. He did not choose himself to have the glory of becoming a high priest. But God chose him. God said to Christ, \"You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.\"",
  "6": "And in another part of the Scriptures God says, \"You are a priest foreverâ€” the kind of priest Melchizedek was.\"",

  "8": "Jesus was the Son of God, but he still suffered, and through his sufferings he learned to obey whatever God says.",
  "9": "This made him the perfect high priest, who provides the way for everyone who obeys him to be saved forever.",
  "10": "God made him high priest, just like Melchizedek.",
  "11": "We have many things to tell you about this. But it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand.",
  "12": "You have had enough time that by now you should be teachers. But you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God's teaching. You still need the teaching that is like milk. You are not ready for solid food.",
  "13": "Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right.",
  "14": "But solid food is for people who have grown up. From their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil."
