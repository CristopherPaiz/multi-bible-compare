  "1": "You were raised from death with Christ. So live for what is in heaven, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.",
  "2": "Think only about what is up there, not what is here on earth.",
  "3": "Your old sinful self has died, and your new life is kept with Christ in God.",
  "4": "Yes, Christ is now your life, and when he comes again, you will share in his glory.",
  "5": "So put everything evil out of your life: sexual sin, doing anything immoral, letting sinful thoughts control you, and wanting things that are wrong. And don't keep wanting more and more for yourself, which is the same as worshiping a false god.",
  "6": "God will show his anger against those who don't obey him, because they do these evil things.",
  "7": "You also did these things in the past, when you lived like them.",
  "8": "But now put these things out of your life: anger, losing your temper, doing or saying things to hurt others, and saying shameful things.",
  "9": "Don't lie to each other, because you have left your old sinful life and what you did before.",
  "10": "You have begun to live a new life in which you are being made new. You are becoming like the one who made you. This new life brings you the true knowledge of God.",
  "11": "In this new life it doesn't matter if you are a Greek or a Jew, circumcised or not. It doesn't matter if you speak a different language or even if you are a Scythian. It doesn't matter if you are a slave or free. Christ is all that matters, and he is in all of you.",
  "12": "God has chosen you and made you his holy people. He loves you. So your new life should be like this: Show mercy to others. Be kind, humble, gentle, and patient.",
  "13": "Don't be angry with each other, but forgive each other. If you feel someone has wronged you, forgive them. Forgive others because the Lord forgave you.",
  "14": "Together with these things, the most important part of your new life is to love each other. Love is what holds everything together in perfect unity.",
  "15": "Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking. It is for peace that you were chosen to be together in one body. And always be thankful.",
  "16": "Let the teaching of Christ live inside you richly. Use all wisdom to teach and counsel each other. Sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.",

  "20": "Children, obey your parents in everything. This pleases the Lord.",
  "21": "Fathers, don't upset your children. If you are too hard to please, they might want to stop trying.",
  "22": "Servants, obey your masters in everything. Obey all the time, even when they can't see you. Don't just pretend to work hard so that they will treat you well. No, you must serve your masters honestly because you respect the Lord.",
  "23": "In all the work you are given, do the best you can. Work as though you are working for the Lord, not any earthly master.",
  "24": "Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord, who will give you what he promised his people. You are serving the Lord Christ.",
  "25": "Remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong. And the Lord treats everyone the same."
