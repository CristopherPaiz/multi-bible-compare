  "6": "Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there. They saw what Jesus did, and they said to themselves,",
  "7": "\"Why does this man say things like that? What an insult to God! No one but God can forgive sins.\"",
  "8": "Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking. So he said to them, \"Why do you have these questions in your minds?",
  "9": "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say to the crippled man, 'Your sins are forgiven.' There's no proof it really happened. But what if I say to the man, 'Stand up. Take your mat and walk'? Then you will be able to see if I really have this power or not.\" So Jesus said to the paralyzed man,",
