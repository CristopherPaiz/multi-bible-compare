  "1": "Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb. She saw that the large stone was moved away from the entrance.",

  "3": "So Peter and the other follower started going to the tomb.",
  "4": "They were both running, but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.",

  "6": "Then Simon Peter finally reached the tomb and went in. He saw the pieces of linen lying there.",
  "7": "He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus' head. It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen.",
  "8": "Then the other follower went inâ€”the one who had reached the tomb first. He saw what had happened and believed.",
  "9": "(These followers did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from death.)",
  "10": "Then the followers went back home.",
  "11": "But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. While she was crying, she bent down and looked inside the tomb.",
  "12": "She saw two angels dressed in white sitting where Jesus' body had been. One was sitting where the head had been; the other was sitting where the feet had been.",

  "15": "He asked her, \"Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?\" She thought that this was the man who takes care of the garden. So she said to him, \"Did you take him away, sir? Tell me where you put him. I will go and get him.\"",
  "16": "Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and said in Aramaic, \"Rabboni.\" (This means \"Teacher.\")",
  "17": "Jesus said to her, \"You don't need to hold on to me! I have not yet gone back up to the Father. But go to my followers and tell them this: 'I am going back to my Father and your Father. I am going back to my God and your God.'\"",
  "18": "Mary Magdalene went to the followers and told them, \"I saw the Lord!\" And she told them what he had said to her.",
  "19": "The day was Sunday, and that same evening the followers were together. They had the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them. He said, \"Peace be with you!\"",
  "20": "As soon as he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. When the followers saw the Lord, they were very happy.",

  "24": "Thomas (called Didymus) was one of the twelve, but he was not with the other followers when Jesus came.",
  "25": "They told him, \"We saw the Lord.\" Thomas said, \"That's hard to believe. I will have to see the nail holes in his hands, put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side. Only then will I believe it.\"",
  "26": "A week later the followers were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. The doors were locked, but Jesus came and stood among them. He said, \"Peace be with you!\"",

  "29": "Jesus said to him, \"You believe because you see me. What great blessings there are for the people who believe without seeing me!\"",
  "30": "Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw, which are not written in this book.",
  "31": "But these are written so that you can believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. Then, by believing, you can have life through his name."
