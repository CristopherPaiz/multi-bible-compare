  "1": "Greetings from Paul, a prisoner for Jesus Christ, and from Timothy, our brother. To Philemon, our dear friend and worker with us.",
  "2": "Also to Apphia, our sister, to Archippus, a worker with us, and to the church that meets in your home.",
  "3": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "4": "I remember you in my prayers. And I always thank my God for you.",
  "5": "I thank God because I hear about the love you have for all of God's holy people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus.",
  "6": "I pray that the faith you share will make you understand every blessing we have in Christ.",
  "7": "My brother, you have shown love to God's people, and your help has greatly encouraged them. What a great joy and encouragement that has been to me.",
  "8": "There is something that you should do. And because of the authority I have in Christ, I feel free to command you to do it.",
  "9": "But I am not commanding you; I am asking you to do it out of love. I, Paul, am an old man now, and I am a prisoner for Christ Jesus.",
  "10": "I am asking you for my son Onesimus. He became my son while I was in prison.",
  "11": "In the past he was useless to you. But now he has become useful for both you and me.",
  "12": "I am sending him back to you, but it's as hard as losing part of myself.",
  "13": "I would like to keep him here to help me while I am still in prison for telling the Good News. By helping me here, he would be representing you.",
  "14": "But I did not want to do anything without asking you first. Then whatever you do for me will be what you want to do, not what I forced you to do.",
  "15": "Onesimus was separated from you for a short time. Maybe that happened so that you could have him back forever,",
  "16": "not to be just a slave, but better than a slave, to be a dear brother. That's what he is to me. And I know he will mean even more to you, both as your slave and as one who shares your faith in the Lord.",
  "17": "If you accept me as your friend, then accept Onesimus back. Welcome him like you would welcome me.",
  "18": "If he has done any wrong to you or owes you anything, charge that to me.",
  "19": "I, Paul, am writing this in my own handwriting: I will pay back anything Onesimus owes. And I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life.",
  "20": "So, my brother, as a follower of the Lord please do this favor for me. It would be such a great encouragement to me as your brother in Christ.",
  "21": "I write this letter knowing that you will do what I ask, and even more than I ask.",
  "22": "Also, please prepare a room for me. I hope that God will answer your prayers and that I will be able to come and see you.",
  "23": "Epaphras is a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus. He sends you his greetings.",
  "24": "Also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke send their greetings. They are workers together with me.",
  "25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
