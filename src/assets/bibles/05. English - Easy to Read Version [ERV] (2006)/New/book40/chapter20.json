  "3": "\"About nine o'clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there. They were doing nothing.",

  "8": "\"At the end of the day, the owner of the field said to the boss of all the workers, 'Call the workers and pay them all. Start by paying the last people I hired. Then pay all of them, ending with the ones I hired first.'",
  "9": "\"The workers who were hired at five o'clock came to get their pay. Each worker got one silver coin.",
  "10": "Then the workers who were hired first came to get their pay. They thought they would be paid more than the others. But each one of them also received one silver coin.",

  "12": "They said, 'Those people were hired last and worked only one hour. But you paid them the same as us. And we worked hard all day in the hot sun.'",
  "13": "\"But the man who owned the field said to one of them, 'Friend, I am being fair with you. You agreed to work for one silver coin. Right?",
  "14": "So take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay I gave you.",
  "15": "I can do what I want with my own money. Why would you be jealous because I am generous?'",

  "19": "They will hand him over to the foreigners, who will laugh at him and beat him with whips, and then they will kill him on a cross. But on the third day after his death, he will be raised to life again.\"",

  "23": "Jesus said to them, \"It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left. My Father has decided who will do that. He has prepared those places for them.\"",
