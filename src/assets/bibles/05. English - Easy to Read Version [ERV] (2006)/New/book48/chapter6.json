  "1": "Brothers and sisters, someone in your group might do something wrong. You who are following the Spirit should go to the one who is sinning. Help make that person right again, and do it in a gentle way. But be careful, because you might be tempted to sin too.",
  "2": "Help each other with your troubles. When you do this, you are obeying the law of Christ.",

  "15": "It doesn't matter if anyone is circumcised or not. The only thing that matters is this new life we have from God.",
