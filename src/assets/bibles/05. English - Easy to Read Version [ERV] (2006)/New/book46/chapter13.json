  "1": "I may speak in different languages, whether human or even of angels. But if I don't have love, I am only a noisy bell or a ringing cymbal.",
  "2": "I may have the gift of prophecy, I may understand all secrets and know everything there is to know, and I may have faith so great that I can move mountains. But even with all this, if I don't have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "I may give away everything I have to help others, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned. But I gain nothing by doing all this if I don't have love.",
  "4": "Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud.",

  "6": "Love is never happy when others do wrong, but it is always happy with the truth.",
  "7": "Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.",

  "12": "It is the same with us. Now we see God as if we are looking at a reflection in a mirror. But then, in the future, we will see him right before our eyes. Now I know only a part, but at that time I will know fully, as God has known me.",
  "13": "So these three things continue: faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love."
