  "2": "Then I saw another angel coming from the east. This angel had the seal of the living God. The angel called out in a loud voice to the four angels. These were the four angels that God had given the power to hurt the earth and the sea. The angel said to them,",
  "3": "\"Don't harm the land or the sea or the trees before we mark the foreheads of those who serve our God.\"",
  "4": "Then I heard how many people had God's mark on their foreheads. There were 144,000. They were from every tribe of the people of Israel:",

  "8": "from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000",
  "9": "Then I looked, and there was a large crowd of people. There were so many people that no one could count them all. They were from every nation, tribe, race of people, and language of the earth. They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They all wore white robes and had palm branches in their hands.",
  "10": "They shouted loudly, \"Victory belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.\"",
  "11": "The elders and the four living beings were there. All the angels were standing around them and the throne. The angels bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God.",
  "12": "They said, \"Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever. Amen!\"",

  "15": "So now these people are before the throne of God. They worship God day and night in his temple. And the one who sits on the throne will protect them.",
  "16": "They will never be hungry again. They will never be thirsty again. The sun will not hurt them. No heat will burn them.",
  "17": "The Lamb in front of the throne will be their shepherd. He will lead them to springs of water that give life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.\""
