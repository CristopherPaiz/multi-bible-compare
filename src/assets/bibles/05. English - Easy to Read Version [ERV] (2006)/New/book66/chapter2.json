  "2": "\"I know what you do, how hard you work and never give up. I know that you don't accept evil people. You have tested those who say they are apostles but are not. You found that they are liars.",

  "5": "So remember where you were before you fell. Change your hearts and do what you did at first. If you don't change, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.",

  "10": "Don't be afraid of what will happen to you. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison. He will do this to test you. You will suffer for ten days, but be faithful, even if you have to die. If you continue to be faithful, I will give you the crown of life.",

  "13": "\"I know where you live. You live where Satan has his throne, but you are true to me. You did not refuse to tell about your faith in me even during the time of Antipas. Antipas was my faithful witness who was killed in your city, the city where Satan lives.",
  "14": "\"But I have a few things against you. You have people there who follow the teaching of Balaam. Balaam taught Balak how to make the people of Israel sin. They sinned by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sins.",
  "15": "It is the same in your group. You have people who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans.",
  "16": "So change your hearts! If you don't change, I will come to you quickly and fight against these people with the sword that comes out of my mouth.",

  "22": "\"So I will throw her on a bed of suffering. And all those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly. I will do this now if they don't turn away from the things she does.",
  "23": "I will also kill her followers. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who knows what people feel and think. And I will repay each of you for what you have done.",
