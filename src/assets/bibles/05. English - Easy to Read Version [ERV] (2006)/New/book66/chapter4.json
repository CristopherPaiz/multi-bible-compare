  "2": "Immediately the Spirit took control of me, and there in heaven was a throne with someone sitting on it.",
  "3": "The one sitting there was as beautiful as precious stones, like jasper and carnelian. All around the throne was a rainbow with clear colors like an emerald.",
  "4": "In a circle around the throne were 24 other thrones with 24 elders sitting on them. The elders were dressed in white, and they had golden crowns on their heads.",
  "5": "Lightning flashes and noises of thunder came from the throne. Before the throne there were seven lamps burning, which are the seven Spirits of God.",
  "6": "Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In front of the throne and on each side of it there were four living beings. They had eyes all over them, in front and in back.",
  "7": "The first living being was like a lion. The second was like a cow. The third had a face like a man. The fourth was like a flying eagle.",

  "9": "These living beings were giving glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever. And every time they did this,",
  "10": "the 24 elders bowed down before the one who sits on the throne. They worshiped him who lives forever and ever. They put their crowns down before the throne and said,",
  "11": "\"Our Lord and God! You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power. You made all things. Everything existed and was made because you wanted it.\""
