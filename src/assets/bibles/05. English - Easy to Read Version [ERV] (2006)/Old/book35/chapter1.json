  "1": "This is the message that was given to Habakkuk the prophet.",
  "2": "Lord, I continue to ask for help. When will you listen to me? I cried to you about the violence, but you did nothing!",
  "3": "People are stealing things and hurting others. They are arguing and fighting. Why do you make me look at these terrible things?",
  "4": "The law is weak and not fair to people. Evil people win their fights against good people. So the law is no longer fair, and justice does not win anymore.",
  "5": "\"Look at the other nations! Watch them, and you will be amazed. I will do something in your lifetime that will amaze you. You would not believe it even if you were told about it.",

  "12": "Lord, you are the one who lives forever! You are my holy God who never dies! Lord, you created the Babylonians to do what must be done. Our Rock, you created them to punish people.",
  "13": "Your eyes are too good to look at evil. You cannot stand to see people do wrong. So why do you permit such evil? How can you watch while the wicked destroy people who are so much better?",
  "14": "You made people like fish in the sea. They are like little sea animals without a leader.",
  "15": "The enemy catches all of them with hooks and nets. The enemy catches them in his net and drags them in, and the enemy is very happy with what he caught.",
