  "3": "Then Absalom would say, \"Look, you are right, but King David will not listen to you.\"",
  "4": "Absalom would also say, \"Oh, I wish someone would make me a judge in this country! Then I could help everyone who comes to me with a problem. I would help them get a fair solution to their problem.\"",
  "5": "And if anyone came to Absalom and started to bow down to him, Absalom would treat him like a close friendâ€”he would reach out and touch him and kiss him.",
  "6": "Absalom did that to all the Israelites who came to King David for judgment. In this way Absalom won the hearts of all the people of Israel.",

  "33": "David said to Hushai, \"If you go with me, you will be just one more person to care for.",
  "34": "But if you go back to Jerusalem, you can disagree with Ahithophel and make his advice useless. Tell Absalom, 'King, I am your servant. I served your father, but now I will serve you.'",
  "35": "The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you. You must tell them everything you hear in the king's palace.",
