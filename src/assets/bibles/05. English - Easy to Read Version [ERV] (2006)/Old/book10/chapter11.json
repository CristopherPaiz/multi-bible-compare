  "7": "When Uriah came, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were, and how the war was going.",

  "9": "But Uriah did not go home. He slept outside the door of the king's palace, as the rest of the king's servants did.",
  "10": "The servants told David, \"Uriah did not go home.\" Then David said to Uriah, \"You came from a long trip. Why did you not go home?\"",
  "11": "Uriah said to David, \"The Holy Box and the soldiers of Israel and Judah are staying in tents. My lord Joab and my lord's officers are camping out in the field. So it is not right for me to go home to eat and drink and sleep with my wife. As surely as you live, I will not do this.\"",

  "16": "Joab watched the city and saw where the bravest Ammonites were. He chose Uriah to go to that place.",
  "17": "The men of the city came out to fight against Joab. Some of David's men were killed. Uriah the Hittite was one of them.",
  "18": "Then Joab sent a report to David about what happened in the battle.",
  "19": "Joab told the messenger to tell King David what had happened in the battle.",
  "20": "\"The king might get upset and ask, 'Why did Joab's army go that close the city to fight? Surely he knows that there are men on the city walls who can shoot arrows down at his men?",
  "21": "Surely he remembers that at Thebez a woman killed Abimelech son of Jerub Besheth when he threw the top part of a grinding stone down from the wall. So why did he go that close to the wall?' If King David says something like that, tell him, 'Your officer, Uriah the Hittite, also died.'\"",
  "22": "The messenger went in and told David everything Joab told him to say.",
  "23": "The messenger told David, \"The men of Ammon attacked us in the field. We fought them and chased them all the way to the city gate.",

  "25": "David said to the messenger, \"Give this message to Joab: 'Don't be too upset about this. A sword can kill one person as well as the next. Make a stronger attack against Rabbah and you will win.' Encourage Joab with these words.\"",
  "26": "Bathsheba heard that her husband Uriah had died, so she mourned for him.",
  "27": "After her time of sadness, David sent servants to bring her to his house. She became David's wife and gave birth to a son for David. But the Lord did not like what David had done."
