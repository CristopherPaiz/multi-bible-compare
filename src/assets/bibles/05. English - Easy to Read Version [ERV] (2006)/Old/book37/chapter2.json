  "3": "'How many of you people look at this Temple and try to compare it to the beautiful Temple that was destroyed? What do you think? Does this Temple seem like nothing when you compare it with the first Temple?",
  "4": "But now, Zerubbabel, the Lord says, \"Don't be discouraged!\" And to the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the Lord says, \"Don't be discouraged!\" To everyone in this country, the Lord says, \"Don't be discouraged! Continue this work, because I am with you!\" This is what the Lord All- Powerful said!",
  "5": "\"'I made an agreement with you when you left Egypt, and I have kept my promise. My Spirit is with you, so don't be afraid!'",
  "6": "This is what the Lord All-Powerful said, 'In just a little while, I will once again shake things up. I will shake heaven and earth, and I will shake the sea and the dry land.",

  "11": "\"The Lord All-Powerful commands you to ask the priests what the law says about these things:",
  "12": "'Suppose a man carries some meat in the fold of his clothes. This meat is part of a sacrifice, so it is holy. If his clothes touch some bread, cooked food, wine, oil, or some other food, will the thing the clothes touch become holy?'\" The priests answered, \"No.\"",
  "13": "Then Haggai said, \"Whoever touches a dead body will become unclean. Now if they touch anything else, will it also become unclean?\" The priests answered, \"Yes, it will become unclean.\"",
  "14": "Then Haggai said, \"This is what the Lord God said: 'This is also true about the people of this nation. They were not pure and holy before me. So anything they touched with their hands and anything they brought {to the altar} became unclean.",
  "15": "\"'Think about what has happened to you. Think about how things were before you began working on the Lord's Temple.",
  "16": "People wanted 20 measures of grain, but there were only 10 measures in the pile. People wanted to get 50 jars of wine from the wine vat, but there were only 20.",
  "17": "That was because I punished you. I sent the diseases that killed your plants and the hail that destroyed the things you made with your hands. I did this, but still you did not come to me.' This is what the Lord said.",

I will defeat their war horses and riders. These armies are friends now, but they will turn against each other and kill each other with swords.\"",
  "23": "This is what the Lord All-Powerful said. \"Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, I have chosen you. At that time I will use you like a signet ring to prove that I have done these things!\" This is what the Lord All-Powerful said."
