  "3": "Then Balaam said to Balak, \"Stay here near this altar. I will go to another place. Then the Lord will come to me, and he will tell me what I must say.\" Then Balaam went away to a higher place.",
  "4": "God came to Balaam at that place, and Balaam said, \"I have prepared seven altars. And I have killed a bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.\"",
  "5": "Then the Lord told Balaam what he should say. Then the Lord said, \"Go back to Balak and say the things that I have given you to say.\"",
  "6": "So Balaam went back to Balak. Balak was still standing near the altar, and all the leaders of Moab were standing there with them.",
  "7": "Then Balaam said this: Balak, the king of Moab, brought me here from the eastern mountains of Aram. Balak said to me, \"Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, speak against the Israelites.\"",
  "8": "But God is not against them, so I cannot speak against them either! The Lord has not asked for bad things to happen to these people. So I cannot do that either.",
  "9": "I see these people from the mountain. I see them from the high hills. They live alone. They are not part of another nation.",
  "10": "Who can count Jacob's people? They are as many as the grains of dust. No one can count even a fourth of the Israelites. Let me die like a good man. Let my life end as happy as theirs!",

  "14": "So Balak led Balaam to Watchmen Hills. This was on top of Mount Pisgah. There Balak built seven altars and killed a bull and a ram on each altar as a sacrifice.",
  "15": "Then Balaam said to Balak, \"Stay here by this altar while I will go meet with God over there.\"",
  "16": "So the Lord came to Balaam and told Balaam what to say. Then he told Balaam to go back to Balak and say these things.",
  "17": "So Balaam went to Balak. Balak was still standing near the altar. The leaders of Moab were there with him. Balak saw Balaam coming and said, \"What did the Lord say?\"",
  "18": "Then Balaam said this: \"Stand up, Balak, and listen to me. Hear me, Balak son of Zippor.",
  "19": "God is not a man; he will not lie. God is not a human being; his decisions will not change. If he says he will do something, then he will do it. If he makes a promise, then he will do what he promised.",

  "27": "Then Balak said to Balaam, \"So come with me to another place. Maybe God will be pleased and will allow you to curse them from that place.\"",
  "28": "So Balak led Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, which looks out over the desert.",
