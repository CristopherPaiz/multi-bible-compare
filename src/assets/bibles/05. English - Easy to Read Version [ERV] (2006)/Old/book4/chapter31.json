  "3": "So Moses spoke to the people. He said, \"Choose some of your men to be soldiers. The Lord will use these men to do to the Midianites what they did to you.",
  "4": "Choose 1000 men from each of the tribes of Israel.",
  "5": "There will be a total of 12,000 soldiers from the tribes of Israel.\"",
  "6": "Moses sent these 12,000 men to war. He sent Phineas son of Eleazar with them as the priest. Phineas took the holy things and the horns and trumpets with him.",

  "15": "Moses said to them, \"Why did you let the women live?",
  "16": "These are the women who listened to Balaam and caused the men of Israel to turn away from the Lord that time at Peor. The disease will come to the Lord's people again.",
  "17": "Now, kill all the Midianite boys, and kill all the Midianite women who have had sexual relations with a man.",
  "18": "You can let all the young girls live—but only if they never had sexual relations with any man.",
  "19": "And then, all you men who killed other people must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must stay outside the camp even if you just touched a dead body. On the third day you and your prisoners must make yourselves pure. You must do the same thing again on the seventh day.",

  "22": "You must put gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead into the fire and then wash these things with the special water to make them pure. If something can be put in the fire, you must put it in fire to purify it. If things cannot be put in fire, you must still wash them with the special water.",

  "36": "The soldiers who went to war got 337,500 sheep.",
  "37": "They gave 675 sheep to the Lord.",
  "38": "The soldiers got 36,000 cattle. They gave 72 cattle to the Lord.",
  "39": "The soldiers got 30,500 donkeys. They gave 61 donkeys to the Lord.",
  "40": "The soldiers got 16,000 women. They gave 32 women to the Lord.",
  "41": "Moses gave all of these gifts for the Lord to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord had commanded him.",

  "49": "They told Moses, \"We, your servants, have counted our soldiers. We have not missed any of them.",
  "50": "So we are bringing the Lord's gift from every soldier. We are bringing things that are made of gold—armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces. This gift to the Lord is to make us pure.\"",
  "51": "So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted all these gold items from them.",
