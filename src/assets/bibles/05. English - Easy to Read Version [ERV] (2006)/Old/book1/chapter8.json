  "3": "The water that covered the earth began to go down. After 150 days the water was low enough that the boat touched land again. The boat stopped on one of the mountains of Ararat. This was the 17 day of the seventh month.",

  "21": "The Lord smelled these sacrifices, and it pleased him. He said to himself, \"I will never again curse the earth as a way to punish people. People are evil from the time they are young, but I will never again destroy every living thing on the earth like I have just done.",
  "22": "As long as the earth continues, there will always be a time for planting and a time for harvest. There will always be cold and hot, summer and winter, day and night on earth.\""
