  "2": "The woman answered the snake, \"No, we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden.",
  "3": "But there is one tree we must not eat from. God told us, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch that tree, or you will die.'\"",

  "12": "The man said, \"The woman you put here with me gave me fruit from that tree. So I ate it.\"",
  "13": "Then the Lord God said to the woman, \"What have you done?\" She said, \"The snake tricked me, so I ate the fruit.\"",
  "14": "So the Lord God said to the snake, \"You did this very bad thing, so bad things will happen to you. It will be worse for you than for any other animal. You must crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.",
  "15": "I will make you and the woman enemies to each other. Your children and her children will be enemies. You will bite her child's foot, but he will crush your head.\"",

  "17": "Then the Lord God said to the man, \"I commanded you not to eat from that tree. But you listened to your wife and ate from it. So I will curse the ground because of you. You will have to work hard all your life for the food the ground produces.",
