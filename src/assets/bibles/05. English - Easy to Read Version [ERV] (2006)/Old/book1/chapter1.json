  "21": "So God created the large sea animals. He created all the many living things in the sea and every kind of bird that flies in the air. And God saw that this was good.",
  "22": "God blessed all the living things in the sea and told them to have many babies and fill the seas. And he blessed the birds on land and told them to have many more babies.",
  "23": "There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the fifth day.",

  "29": "God said, \"I am giving you all the grain bearing plants and all the fruit trees. These trees make fruit with seeds in it. This grain and fruit will be your food.",
  "30": "And I am giving all the green plants to the animals. These green plants will be their food. Every animal on earth, every bird in the air, and all the little things that crawl on the earth will eat that food.\" And all these things happened.",
  "31": "God looked at everything he had made. And he saw that everything was very good. There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the sixth day."
