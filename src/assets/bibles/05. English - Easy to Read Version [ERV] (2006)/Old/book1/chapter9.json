  "4": "But I give you one command. You must not eat meat that still has its life (blood) in it.",
  "5": "Also, I will demand your blood for your lives. That is, I will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life.",

  "14": "When I bring clouds over the earth, you will see the rainbow in the clouds.",
  "15": "When I see this rainbow, I will remember the agreement between me and you and every living thing on the earth. This agreement says that a flood will never again destroy all life on the earth.",
  "16": "When I look and see the rainbow in the clouds, I will remember the agreement that continues forever. I will remember the agreement between me and every living thing on the earth.\"",

  "23": "Shem and Japheth took a robe, put it across their shoulders, and walked backward into the tent. Then they covered their father without looking at him.",
