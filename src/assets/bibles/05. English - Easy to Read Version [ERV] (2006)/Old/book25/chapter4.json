  "3": "Even a wild dog feeds her babies. Even the jackal lets her pups suck at her breast. But the daughter of my people is cruel. She is like the ostrich in the desert that forgets its eggs in the sand.",
  "4": "Babies are so thirsty their tongues stick to the roof of their mouths. Young children ask for bread, but no one gives them any.",
  "5": "Those who ate rich food are now dying in the streets. Those who grew up wearing nice red clothes now pick through garbage piles.",
  "6": "The sin of the daughter of my people was very great. Their sin was greater than the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed suddenly. No human hand caused their destruction.",
