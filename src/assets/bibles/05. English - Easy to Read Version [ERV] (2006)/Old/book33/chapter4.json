Then God will teach us his way of living, and we will follow him.\" His teaching, the Lord's message, will begin in Jerusalem on Mount Zion and will go out to all the world.",

They will hammer their swords into plows and use their spears to make tools for harvesting. All fighting between nations will end. They will never again train for war.",

  "10": "Daughter Zion, feel the pain. Give birth to your \"baby.\" You must go out of this city. You will live in the field. That is, you will go to Babylon, but you will also be saved from that place. The Lord will go there and rescue you. He will take you away from your enemies.",
  "11": "Many nations have come to fight against you. They say, \"Look, there is Zion! Let's attack her!\"",
  "12": "They have their plans, but they don't know what the Lord is planning. He brought them here for a special purpose. They will be crushed like grain on a threshing floor.",
  "13": "\"Daughter Zion, get up and crush them! I will make you very strong. It will be as if you have horns of iron and hooves of bronze. You will beat many people into small pieces. You will give their wealth to the Lord. You will give their treasure to the Lord of all the earth.\""
