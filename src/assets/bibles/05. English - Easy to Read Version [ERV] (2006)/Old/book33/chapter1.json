  "1": "During the time that Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, the word of the Lord came to Micah. Micah was from Moresheth. He saw these visions about Samaria and Jerusalem.",
  "2": "Listen, all you people! Earth and everyone on it, listen! The Lord God will come from his holy temple. The Lord will come as a witness against you.",
  "3": "See, the Lord is coming out of his place. He is coming down to walk on the high places of the earth.",
  "4": "The mountains will melt under him like wax before a fire. The valleys will split open and flow like water down a steep hill.",
  "5": "This will happen because of Jacob's sin, because of the sins of the nation of Israel. What caused Jacob to sin? It was Samaria. Where is the high place in Judah? It is Jerusalem.",
  "6": "So I will change Samaria into a pile of rocks in the field, a place ready for planting grapes. I will push Samaria's stones down into the valley, leaving nothing but the foundations.",
  "7": "All her idols will be broken into pieces. Her prostitute's wages (idols) will be burned in fire. I will destroy all her statues of false gods, because Samaria got her riches by being unfaithful to me. So those things will be taken by people who are not faithful to me.",
  "8": "I will be very sad about what will happen. I will go without sandals and clothes. I will cry like a dog. I will mourn like a bird.",
  "9": "Samaria's wound cannot be healed. Her disease has spread to Judah. It has reached the city gate of my people; it has spread all the way to Jerusalem.",

  "12": "The people living in Maroth have become weak waiting for something good to happen, because trouble came down from the Lord and has reached the city gate of Jerusalem.",
  "13": "Lady of Lachish, tie a fast horse to the chariot. Lachish, you are the first to be sacrificed for Daughter Zion because you followed in Israel's sins.",
  "14": "So you must give goodbye gifts to Moresheth in Gath. The houses in Aczib will trick the kings of Israel.",
  "15": "You people who live in Mareshah, I will bring someone against you who will take the things you own. The Glory of Israel will come into Adullam.",
  "16": "So cut off your hair, make yourself bald, because you will cry for the children you love. Make yourself bald like an eagle and show your sadness, because your children will be taken away from you."
