  "6": "There is a time to look for something and a time to consider it lost. There is a time to keep things and a time to throw things away.",

  "10": "I saw all the hard work God gave us to do.",
  "11": "God gave us the ability to think about his world, but we can never completely understand everything he does. And yet, he does everything at just the right time.",

  "17": "So I said to myself, \"God has planned a time for everything, and he has planned a time to judge everything people do. He will judge good people and bad people.\"",
  "18": "I thought about what people do to each other. And I said to myself, \"God wants people to see that they are like animals.",
  "19": "The same thing happens to animals and to peopleâ€”they die. People and animals have the same 'breath.' Is a dead animal different from a dead person? It is all so senseless!",
  "20": "The bodies of people and animals end the same way. They came from the earth, and, in the end, they will go back to the earth.",
  "21": "Who knows what happens to a person's spirit? Who knows if a human's spirit goes up to God while an animal's spirit goes down into the ground?\"",
  "22": "So I saw that the best thing people can do is to enjoy what they do, because that is all they have. Besides, no one can help another person see what will happen in the future."
