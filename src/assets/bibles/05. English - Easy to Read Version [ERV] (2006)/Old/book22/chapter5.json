  "1": "My darling my bride, I have entered my garden. I have gathered my myrrh and spice. I have eaten my honey and honeycomb. I have drunk my wine and milk. Dearest friends, eat, drink! Be drunk with love!",
  "2": "I am asleep, but my heart is awake. I hear my lover knocking, saying; \"Open to me, my darling, my love, my dove, my perfect one! My head is soaked with dew. My hair is wet with the mist of the night.\"",
  "3": "\"I have taken off my robe. I don't want to put it on again. I have washed my feet, I don't want to get them dirty again.\"",
  "4": "But my lover put his hand through the opening, and I felt sorry for him.",
  "5": "I got up to open for my lover, myrrh dripping from my hands, myrrh scented lotion dripped from my fingers onto the handles of the lock.",
  "6": "I opened for my lover, but my lover had turned away and was gone! I nearly died when he came and went. I looked for him, but I couldn't find him; I called for him, but he didn't answer me.",
  "7": "The guards patrolling the city found me. They hit me. They hurt me. The guards on the wall took my robe from me.",
  "8": "I tell you, women of Jerusalem, if you find my lover, tell him I am weak with love.",
  "9": "Beautiful woman, how is your lover different from other lovers? Is your lover better than other lovers? Is that why you ask us to make this promise?",
  "10": "My lover is tanned and radiant. He would stand out among 10,000 men.",
  "11": "His head is like the purest gold. His hair is curly and as black as a raven.",
  "12": "His eyes are like doves by a stream, like doves in a pool of milk, like a jewel in its setting.",
  "13": "His cheeks are like a garden of spices, like flowers used for perfume. His lips are like lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh.",
  "14": "His arms are like gold rods, filled with jewels. His body is like smooth ivory with sapphires set in it.",
  "15": "His legs are like marble pillars on bases of fine gold. He stands tall like the finest cedar tree in Lebanon!",
  "16": "Yes, women of Jerusalem, my lover is the most desirable. His mouth is the sweetest of all. This is my lover; this is my darling."
