  "12": "The priest will take one of the lambs and the oil as a guilt offering. He will lift them in front of the Lord to show they were presented to God.",
  "13": "Then the priest will kill the male lamb in the holy place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is very holy.",
  "14": "\"The priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering. He will put some of this blood on the tip of the right ear of the person to be made clean. The priest will put some of this blood on the thumb of the right hand and on the big toe of the right foot of that person.",

The poor person must also take?of a pint of olive oil",

  "35": "The person who owns that house must come and tell the priest, 'I see something like mildew in my house.'",
  "36": "\"Then the priest must order the people to take everything out of the house before he goes in to look at the mildew. Then the priest will not have to say everything in the house is unclean. After the people have taken everything out of the house, the priest will go in to look at the house.",
  "37": "He will look at the mildew. If the mildew on the walls of the house has holes that are a green or red color, and if the mildew goes into the wall's surface,",

  "39": "\"On the seventh day the priest must come back and check the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls of the house,",

  "43": "\"Maybe someone took away the old stones and plaster and put in new stones and plaster. And maybe mildew again appears in that house.",

  "47": "Anyone who eats in that house or lies down in there must wash their clothes.",
