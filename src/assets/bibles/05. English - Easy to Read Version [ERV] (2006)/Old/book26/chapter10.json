  "1": "Then I looked up at the bowl over the heads of the Cherub angels. The bowl looked clear blue like sapphire, and there was something that looked like a throne over it.",
  "2": "Then {the one sitting on the throne} said to the man dressed in linen clothes, \"Step into the area between the wheels under the Cherub angels. Take a handful of the burning coals from between the Cherub angels and go throw them over the city of Jerusalem.\" The man walked past me.",
  "3": "The Cherub angels were standing in the area south of the Temple as the man walked to them. The cloud filled the inner courtyard.",
  "4": "Then the Glory of the Lord rose up off the Cherub angels near the threshold of the door of the Temple. Then the cloud filled the Temple, and the bright light from the Glory of the Lord filled the whole courtyard.",
  "5": "The noise from the wings of the Cherub angels could be heard all the way out in the outer courtyard. The sound was very loud—like the thundering voice when God All-Powerful speaks.",
  "6": "God had given the man dressed in linen clothes a command. He had told him to go into the area between the wheels among the Cherub angels and get some hot coals. So the man went there and stood by the wheel.",
  "7": "One of the Cherub angels reached out his hand and took some of the hot coals from the area between the Cherub angels. He poured the coals into the man's hands, and the man left.",
  "8": "(The Cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings.)",
  "9": "Then I noticed that there were four wheels. There was one wheel by each Cherub angel, and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel.",
  "10": "There were four wheels, and they all looked the same. They looked like there was a wheel in a wheel.",
  "11": "They could go in any direction when they moved, but {the Cherub angels} did not turn around when they moved. They went in the direction that the head was looking. They did not turn around when they moved.",
  "12": "There were eyes all over their bodies. There were eyes on their backs, on their arms, on their wings, and on their wheels—on all four wheels!",
  "13": "These wheels were what I heard called, \"the area between the wheels.\"",
  "14": "Each Cherub angel had four faces. The first was the face of a Cherub, the second was the face of a man, the third was a lion's face, and the fourth was an eagle's face. (These Cherub angels were the living beings I saw in the vision by the Kebar Canal. ) Then the Cherub angels rose into the air,",
  "15": "",
  "16": "and the wheels rose with them. When the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air, not even the wheels turned around.",
  "17": "If they flew into the air, the wheels went with them. If they stood still, so did the wheels, because the spirit of the living being was in them.",
  "18": "Then the Glory of the Lord rose from the threshold of the Temple, moved to the place over the Cherub angels, and stopped there.",
  "19": "Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air. I saw them leave. The wheels went with them. Then they stopped at the East Gate of the Lord's Temple. The Glory of the God of Israel was in the air above them.",
  "20": "These were the living beings under the Glory of the God of Israel in the vision at the Kebar Canal, and now I realized they were Cherub angels.",
  "21": "Each living being had four faces, four wings, and something that looked like human arms under their wings.",
  "22": "The faces of the Cherub angels were the same as the four faces on the living beings in the vision by the Kebar Canal. They all looked straight ahead in the direction they were going."
