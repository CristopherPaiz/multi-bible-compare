  "2": "\"Son of man, look toward Jerusalem and speak against their holy places. Speak against the land of Israel for me.",
  "3": "Say to the land of Israel, 'This is what the Lord said: I am against you! I will pull my sword from its sheath. I will remove all people from you—the good and the evil.",
  "4": "I will cut both good people and evil people from you. I will pull my sword from its sheath and use it against all people from south to north.",
  "5": "Then everyone will know that I am the Lord. They will know that I have pulled my sword from its sheath. My sword will not go back into its sheath again until it is finished.'",
  "6": "\"Son of man, make sad sounds like a sad person with a broken heart. Make these sad sounds in front of the people.",
  "7": "Then they will ask you, 'Why are you making these sad sounds?' Then you must say, 'Because of the sad news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear. All hands will become weak. Every spirit will become weak. All knees will be like water.' Look, that bad news is coming. These things will happen!\" This is what the Lord God said.",
  "8": "The word of the Lord came to me. He said,",
  "9": "\"Son of man, speak to the people for me. Say this, 'This is what the Lord God says: \"'Look, a sword, a sharp sword, and it has been polished.",

  "11": "So the sword has been polished. Now it can be used. The sword was sharpened and polished. Now it can be put in the hand of the killer.",
  "12": "\"'Son of man, shout out and scream because the sword will be used against my people and all the rulers of Israel. They wanted war—so they will be with my people when the sword comes. So slap your thigh to show your sadness,",
  "13": "because it is not just a test. You refused to be punished with the wooden stick, so what else should I use to punish you? {A sword?}'\" This is what the Lord God said.",
  "14": "\"Son of man, clap your hands to show your sadness, and speak to the people for me. \"Let the sword come down twice, no, three times! This sword is for killing the people. This is the sword for the great killing. This sword will cut into them.",

  "19": "\"Son of man, draw two roads that the sword of the king of Babylon can use to come to Israel. Both roads will come from the same country. Then draw a sign at the head of the road to the city.",
  "20": "Use the sign to show which road the sword will use. One road leads to the Ammonite city of Rabbah. The other road leads to Judah, to the protected city, Jerusalem.",
  "21": "This shows that the king of Babylon has come to the place where the two roads separate. He has used magic signs to find the future. He shook some arrows. He asked questions from family idols. He looked at the liver from an animal he killed.",
  "22": "\"The signs tell him to take the road on his right, the road leading to Jerusalem! He plans to bring the battering rams. He will give the command, and his soldiers will begin the killing. They will shout the battle cry. Then they will build a wall of dirt around the city. They will build a dirt road leading up to the walls. They will build wooden towers to attack the city.",
  "23": "Those magic signs mean nothing to the people of Israel. They have the promises they made. But {the Lord} will remember their sin, so the Israelites will be captured.\"",
  "24": "This is what the Lord God says: \"You have done many evil things. Your sins are very clear. You forced me to remember that you are guilty, so the enemy will catch you in his hand.",

  "26": "This is what the Lord God says: \"Take off the turban! Take off the crown! The time has come to change. The important leaders will be brought low, and those who are not important now will become important leaders.",

  "28": "\"Son of man, speak to the people for me. Say this, 'This is what the Lord God says to the people of Ammon and their shameful god: \"'Look, a sword! The sword is out of its sheath. It has been polished. The sword is ready to kill. It was polished to flash like lightning!",
  "29": "\"'Your visions are useless. Your magic will not help you. It is only a bunch of lies. The sword is now at the throats of evil men. They will soon be only dead bodies. Their time has come. The time has come for their evil to end.",
