  "1": "Then the word of the Lord came to me again.",
  "2": "He said, \"Son of man, turn toward the mountains of Israel. Speak against them for me.",
  "3": "Tell the mountains this: \"'Mountains of Israel, listen to this message from the Lord God! The Lord God says these things to the hills and mountains and to the ravines and valleys. Look! I am bringing the enemy to fight against you. I will destroy your high places.",

  "5": "I will put the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of their filthy idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.",
  "6": "Bad things will happen wherever your people live. Their cities will become piles of rock. Their high places will be destroyed, so those places of worship will never be used again. The altars will all be destroyed. People will never worship those filthy idols again. The incense altars will be smashed. Everything you made will be destroyed completely.",
  "7": "Your people will be killed, and then you will know that I am the Lord!'\"",

  "9": "Then the survivors will be taken prisoners. They will be forced to live in other countries, but they will remember me. I broke their spirit. They will hate themselves for the evil things they did. In the past, they turned away from me and left me. They chased after their filthy idols.

  "12": "People far away will die from disease. People near this place will be killed with swords, and those who are left in the city will starve to death. Only then will I stop being angry.",
  "13": "Only then will you know that I am the Lord. You will know this when you see your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols and around their altars. Those bodies will be near every one of your places for worship, on every high hill and mountain, under every green tree and every oak tree with leaves. You offered your sacrifices everywhere. They were a sweet smell for your filthy idols.",
  "14": "But I will raise my arm over you and punish you and your people, wherever they live! I will destroy your country! It will be emptier than Diblah Desert. Then they will know that I am the Lord!\""
