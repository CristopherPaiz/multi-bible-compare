  "1": "Then the angel who was talking to me returned and woke me up. I was like a person waking up from sleep.",
  "2": "Then the angel asked me, \"What do you see?\" I said, \"I see a solid gold lampstand. There are seven lamps on the lampstand, and there is a bowl on top of it. There are seven tubes coming from the bowl. One tube goes to each lamp. {The tubes bring the oil in the bowl to each of the lamps.}",
  "3": "There are two olive trees by the bowl, one on the right side and one on the left side. {These trees produce the oil for the lamps.}\"",
  "4": "Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, \"Sir, what do these things mean?\"",

Now the seven sides of the stone you saw represent the eyes of the Lord looking in every direction. They see everything on earth.\"",

  "12": "I also said to him, \"I saw two olive branches by the gold tubes with gold colored oil flowing from them. What do these things mean?\"",
  "13": "Then the angel said to me, \"Don't you know what these things mean?\" I said, \"No, sir.\"",
  "14": "So he said, \"They represent the two men chosen to serve the Lord of the whole world.\""
