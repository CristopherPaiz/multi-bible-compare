  "2": "The cypress trees will cry because the cedar trees have fallen. Those powerful trees will be taken away. Oak trees in Bashan will cry for the forest that was cut down.",
  "3": "Listen to the crying shepherds. Their powerful leaders were taken away. Listen to the roaring of the young lions. Their thick bushes near the Jordan River have all been taken away.",
  "4": "The Lord my God says, \"Care for the sheep that have been raised to be killed.",
  "5": "Owners kill their sheep and are not punished. Those who sell the sheep and say, 'Praise the Lord, I am rich!' The shepherds don't feel sorry for their sheep.",
  "6": "And I don't feel sorry for the people who live in this country.\" This is what the Lord said: \"Look, I will let everyone be under the control of their neighbor and king. I will let them destroy the country—I will not stop them!\"",

  "13": "Then the Lord told me, \"So that's how much they think I'm worth. Throw that large amount of money into the Temple treasury.\" So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury at the Lord's Temple.",
  "14": "Then I cut the stick named Union into two pieces. I did this to show that the union between Judah and Israel had been broken.",
  "15": "Then the Lord said to me, \"Now, get the things a foolish shepherd might use.",
  "16": "This will show that I will get a new shepherd for this country. But this young man will not be able to take care of the sheep that are being destroyed. He will not be able to heal the hurt sheep or feed those that are left alive. And the healthy ones will be eaten completely—only their hoofs will be left.\"",
  "17": "Too bad for you, you worthless shepherd! You abandoned my sheep. Punish him! Strike his arm and right eye with a sword. His arm will be useless. His right eye will be blind."
