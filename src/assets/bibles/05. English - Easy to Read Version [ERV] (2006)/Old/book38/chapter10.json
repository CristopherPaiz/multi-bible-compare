  "1": "Pray to the Lord for rain in the springtime. The Lord will send the lightning and the rain will fall, and he will make the plants grow in each person's field.",
  "2": "People use their little statues and magic to learn what will happen in the future, but that is useless. They see visions and tell about their dreams, but it is nothing but worthless lies. So the people are like sheep wandering here and there crying for help, but there is no shepherd to lead them.",
  "3": "The Lord says, \"I am very angry with the shepherds. I made them responsible for what happens to my sheep.\" (The people of Judah are his flock, and the Lord All- Powerful really does take care of his flock. He cares for them as a soldier cares for his beautiful war horse.)",

  "11": "As before, the Lord will strike the waves, and the people will walk across their sea of troubles. He will make the waters of the Nile River dry up. He will destroy Assyria's pride and Egypt's power.",
  "12": "He will make his people strong, and they will live for him and his name. This is what the Lord said."
