The kings of the Amorites living west of the Jordan River and the Canaanites living by the Mediterranean Sea heard about this and became very frightened. After that they were not brave enough to stand and fight against the Israelites.",
  "2": "At that time the Lord said to Joshua, \"Make knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of Israel.\"",
  "3": "So Joshua made knives from flint rocks. Then he circumcised the men of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth.",
  "4": "This is why Joshua circumcised the men: After the Israelites left Egypt, all the men who were able to serve in the army were circumcised. While in the desert, many of the fighting men did not listen to the Lord. So the Lord promised that they would not see the \"land where much food grows.\" He promised our ancestors to give us that land, but because of those men, he forced the people to wander in the desert for 40 years. That way all those fighting men would die. So all the fighting men died, and their sons took their place. But none of the boys who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised. So Joshua circumcised them.",

  "12": "The next morning, the manna from heaven stopped coming. This happened the first day after the people ate the food that grew in the land of Canaan. From that time on, the Israelites did not get the manna from heaven.",
  "13": "When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him. The man had a sword in his hand. Joshua went to the man and asked, \"Are you a friend to our people, or are you one of our enemies?\"",
  "14": "The man answered, \"I am not an enemy. I am the commander of the Lord's army. I have just now come to you.\" Then Joshua bowed his face to the ground to show respect and said, \"I am your servant. Does my master have a command for me?\"",
  "15": "The commander of the Lord's army answered, \"Take off your sandals. The place where you are standing is holy.\" So Joshua obeyed him."
