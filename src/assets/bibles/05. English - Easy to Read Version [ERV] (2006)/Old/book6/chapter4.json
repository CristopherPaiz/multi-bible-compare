  "8": "So the Israelites obeyed Joshua. They carried twelve rocks from the middle of the Jordan River. There was one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.

  "9": "(Joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the Jordan River. He put them at the place where the priests had stood while carrying the Lord's Holy Box. These rocks are still there today.)",
  "10": "The Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people what to do. This is what Moses had said Joshua must do. So the priests carrying the Holy Box stood in the middle of the river until everything was done. Meanwhile, the people hurried across the river.",
  "11": "After the people finished crossing the river, the priests carried the Lord's Holy Box to the front of the people.",
  "12": "The men from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh obeyed Moses. These men crossed the river in front of the other people. These men were prepared for war. They were going to help the rest of the Israelites take the land God had promised to give them.",

  "17": "So Joshua commanded the priests, \"Come out of the Jordan River.\"",
  "18": "The priests obeyed Joshua. They carried the Box with them and came out of the river. When their feet touched the land on the other side of the river, the water in the river began flowing again. The water again overflowed its banks just as it had before the people crossed.",
  "19": "The people crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho.",

  "23": "The Lord your God caused the water in the Jordan River to stop flowing so that you could cross it on dry landâ€”just as the time the Lord stopped the water at the Red Sea so that we could cross it on dry land.",
  "24": "The Lord did this so that all the people in this country would know that he is very powerful. Then they will always be afraid of the Lord your God.\""
