  "2": "\"My servant Moses is dead. Now you and all these people must go across the Jordan River. You must go into the land I am giving to the Israelites.",
  "3": "I promised Moses that I would give you this land, so I will give you all the land wherever you go.",
  "4": "All the land from the desert to Lebanon all the way to the great river (that is, the Euphrates River) and all the land of the Hittites will be yours. And all the land from here to the Mediterranean Sea in the west (that is, the place where the sun sets) will be within your borders.",
  "5": "Just as I was with Moses, I will be with you. No one will be able to stop you all your life. I will not abandon you. I will never leave you.",
  "6": "\"Joshua, you must be strong and brave! You must lead these people so that they can take their land. I promised their fathers that I would give them this land.",
  "7": "But you must be strong and brave about obeying the commands my servant Moses gave you. If you follow his teachings exactly, you will be successful in everything you do.",
  "8": "Always remember what is written in that book of law. Speak about that book and study it day and night. Then you can be sure to obey what is written there. If you do this, you will be wise and successful in everything you do.",
  "9": "Remember, I commanded you to be strong and brave. Don't be afraid, because the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.\"",

  "11": "\"Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get some food ready. Three days from now we will go across the Jordan River and take the land that the Lord our God is giving us.'\"",
  "12": "Then Joshua said to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh,",
  "13": "\"Remember what the Lord's servant Moses told you. He said the Lord your God would give you a place to rest. He will give you that land!",
  "14": "In fact, the Lord has already given you this land east of the Jordan River. Your wives and children can stay in this land with your animals. But your fighting men must cross the Jordan River with your brothers. You must be ready for war and to help them take their land.",
  "15": "The Lord gave you a place to rest, and he will do the same for your brothers. But you must help them until they get the land the Lord their God is giving them. Then you can come back to your own land, the land east of the Jordan River. The Lord's servant Moses gave you that land.\"",
  "16": "Then the people answered Joshua, \"We will do whatever you command us to do. We will go wherever you tell us to go.",
  "17": "We will obey whatever you say, just as we obeyed Moses. We only ask that the Lord your God be with you just as he was with Moses.",
  "18": "Then anyone who refuses to obey your commands or turns against you will be killed. Just be strong and brave!\""
