Since you did this, you will not get up from your bed. You will die!'\"",
  "7": "Ahaziah said to the messengers, \"What did the man look like who met you and told you this?\"",
  "8": "They answered Ahaziah, \"This man was wearing a hairy coat with a leather belt around his waist.\" Then Ahaziah said, \"That was Elijah the Tishbite.\"",
  "9": "Ahaziah sent a captain and 50 men to Elijah. The captain went to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill. The captain said to Elijah, \"Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'\"",
  "10": "Elijah answered the captain of 50, \"If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your 50 men!\" So fire came down from heaven and destroyed the captain and his 50 men.",
  "11": "Ahaziah sent another captain with 50 men to Elijah. He said to Elijah, \"Man of God, the king says, 'Come down quickly!'\"",

  "13": "Ahaziah sent a third captain with 50 men. The third captain came to Elijah. He fell down on his knees and begged Elijah, saying to him, \"Man of God, I ask you, please let my life and the lives of your 50 servants be valuable to you.",
  "14": "Fire came down from heaven and destroyed the first two captains and their 50 men. But now, have mercy and let us live!\"",
  "15": "The Lord's angel said to Elijah, \"Go with the captain. Don't be afraid of him.\" So Elijah went with the captain to see King Ahaziah.",
  "16": "Elijah told Ahaziah, \"There is a God in Israel, so why did you send messengers to ask questions of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Since you did this, you will not get up from your bed. You will die!\"",
