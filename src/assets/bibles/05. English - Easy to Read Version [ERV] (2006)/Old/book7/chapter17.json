  "3": "Micah gave the 28 pounds of silver back to his mother. Then she said, \"I will give this silver as a special gift to the Lord. I will give it to my son so that he can make a statue and cover it with the silver. So now, son, I give the silver back to you.\"",
  "4": "But Micah gave the silver back to his mother. So she took about 5 pounds of the silver and gave them to a silversmith. He used the silver to make a statue covered with silver. The statue was put in Micah's house.",

  "11": "The young Levite agreed to live with Micah. He became like one of Micah's own sons.",
  "12": "Micah chose him to be his priest. So the young man became a priest and lived in Micah's house.",
  "13": "And Micah said, \"Now I know that the Lord will be good to me. I know this because I have a man from the tribe of Levi to be my priest.\""
