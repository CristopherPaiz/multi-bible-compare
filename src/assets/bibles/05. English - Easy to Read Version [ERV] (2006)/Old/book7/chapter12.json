  "2": "Jephthah answered them, \"The Ammonites have been giving us many problems. So my people and I fought against them. I called you, but you didn't come to help us.",

  "5": "The men of Gilead captured the places where people cross the Jordan River. Those places led to the country of Ephraim. Any time a survivor from Ephraim came to the river and said, \"Let me cross,\" the men of Gilead would ask him, \"Are you from Ephraim?\" If he said, \"No,\"",
  "6": "they would say, \"Say the word 'Shibboleth.'\" The men of Ephraim could not say that word correctly. They pronounced the word \"Sibboleth.\" So if the man said, \"Sibboleth,\" then the men of Gilead knew he was from Ephraim. So they would kill him at the crossing place. They killed 42,000 men from Ephraim.",
