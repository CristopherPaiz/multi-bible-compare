  "3": "The Philistine captains asked, \"What are these Hebrews doing here?\" Achish told the Philistine captains, \"This is David. He was one of Saul's officers, but he has been with me for a long time. I found nothing wrong in David since the time he left Saul and came to me.\"",
  "4": "But the Philistine captains were angry with Achish. They said, \"Send him back. Let him go back to the city you gave him, but he can't go into battle with us. As long as he is here, we have an enemy in our own camp. He would make his king happy by killing our men.",

  "11": "So David and his men got up early in the morning and went back to the country of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
