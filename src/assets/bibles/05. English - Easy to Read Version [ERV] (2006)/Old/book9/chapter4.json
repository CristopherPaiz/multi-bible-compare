  "4": "So the people sent men to Shiloh. The men brought back the Lord All-Powerful's Box of the Agreement. On top of the Box are the Cherub angels. They are like the throne that the Lord sits on. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, came with the Box.",

  "7": "They became afraid and said, \"Gods have come to their camp! We're in trouble. This has never happened before.",
  "8": "We are worried. Who can save us from these powerful gods? These gods are the same ones that gave the Egyptians those diseases and terrible sicknesses.",
  "9": "Be brave, Philistines. Fight like men. In the past they were our slaves, so fight like men or you will become their slaves.\"",

  "11": "The Philistines took God's Holy Box and killed Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas.",
  "12": "One of the men who ran from the battle was a man from the tribe of Benjamin. He tore his clothes and put dust on his head to show his great sadness.",
  "13": "Eli was worried about the Holy Box, so he was sitting there by the city gate waiting and watching when the Benjamite man came into Shiloh and told the bad news. All the people in town began to cry loudly.",
  "14": "Eli was 98 years old. He was blind, so he could not see what was happening, but he could hear the loud noise of the people crying. Eli asked, \"Why are the people making this loud noise?\" The Benjamite man ran to Eli and told him what happened.",
  "15": "",
  "16": "He said, \"I am the man who just came from the battle. I ran away from the battle today.\" Eli asked, \"What happened, son?\"",
  "17": "The Benjamite man answered, \"Israel ran away from the Philistines. The Israelite army has lost many soldiers. Your two sons are both dead, and the Philistines took God's Holy Box.\"",

  "20": "She was about to die when the women who were helping her said, \"Don't worry, you have given birth to a son.\" But she did not answer or pay attention.",
  "21": "She named the baby Ichabod, that is to say, \"Israel's glory has been taken away.\" She did this because God's Holy Box was taken away and because both her father-inlaw and her husband were dead.",
  "22": "She said, \"Israel's glory has been taken away\" because the Philistines had taken God's Holy Box."
