  "2": "When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was very pleased. He held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther went in to the room and went near the king. Then she touched the end of the king's gold scepter.",

  "4": "Esther said, \"I have prepared a party for you and Haman. Will you and Haman please come to the party today?\"",

  "9": "Haman left the king's palace that day very happy and in a good mood. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate, he became very angry. Haman was very mad at him because Mordecai didn't show any respect when Haman walked by. Mordecai was not afraid of Haman, and this made Haman mad.",

  "11": "Haman started bragging about how rich he was. He was bragging to his friends about his many sons, and about all the ways the king had honored him. And he was bragging about how the king had promoted him higher than all the other leaders.",
  "12": "\"And that's not all,\" Haman added. \"I'm the only one Queen Esther invited to be with the king at the party she gave. And the Queen also has invited me to be with the king again tomorrow.",
  "13": "But all these things don't really make me happy. I'm not really happy as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate.\"",
  "14": "Then Haman's wife Zeresh and all his friends had a suggestion. They said, \"Tell someone to build a post to hang him on. Make it 75 feet tall. In the morning, ask the king to hang Mordecai on it. Then go to the party with the king and you can be happy.\" Haman liked this suggestion, so he ordered someone to build the hanging post."
