  "3": "In every province where the king's command had come, there was much crying and sadness among the Jews. They were fasting and crying loudly. Many Jews were lying on the ground dressed in sackcloth with ashes on their heads.",
  "4": "Esther's slave women and eunuchs came to her and told her about Mordecai. This made Queen Esther very sad and upset. She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of sackcloth, but he would not accept them.",
  "5": "Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been chosen to serve her. She commanded him to find out what was bothering Mordecai, and why.",
  "6": "So Hathach went out to where Mordecai was in the open place of the city in front of the king's gate.",

  "8": "Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the king's command to kill the Jews. The command had been sent out all over the city of Susa.

That person must be put to death unless the king holds out his gold scepter to the person. If the king does this, that person's life will be saved. And I have not been called to go see the king for 30 days.\"",

  "15": "Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai: \"Mordecai, go and get all the Jews in Susa together, and fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days and nights. I and my women servants will fast too. After we fast, I will go to the king. I know it is against the law to go to the king if he didn't call me, but I will do it anyway. If I die, I die.\"",
