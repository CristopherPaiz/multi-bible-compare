  "21": "Hear this message, you foolish people who have no sense. You have eyes, but you don't see! You have ears, but you don't listen!",
  "22": "Surely you are afraid of me.\" This message is from the Lord. \"You should shake with fear in front of me. I am the one who made the sandy shores to hold back the sea.
