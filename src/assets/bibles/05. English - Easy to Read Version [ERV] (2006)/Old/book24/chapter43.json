  "1": "So Jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the Lord their God. He told them everything that the Lord their God had sent him to tell them.",
  "2": "Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and some other men were proud and stubborn. They became angry with Jeremiah. They said to him, \"Jeremiah, you are lying! The Lord our God didn't send you to say to us, 'You must not go to Egypt to live there.'",
  "3": "Jeremiah, we think that Baruch son of Neriah is encouraging you to be against us. He wants you to give us to the Babylonians. He wants you to do this so they can kill us. Or he wants you to do this so that they can make us captives and take us to Babylon.\"",
  "4": "So Johanan, the army officers, and all the people disobeyed the Lord's command. The Lord had commanded them to stay in Judah.",
  "5": "But instead of obeying the Lord, Johanan and the army officers took the survivors from Judah to Egypt. In the past the enemy had taken the survivors to other countries, but they had come back to Judah.",
  "6": "Now Johanan and all the army officers took all the men, women, and children and led them to Egypt. Among those people were the king's daughters. (Nebuzaradan had put Gedaliah in charge of those people. Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of Babylon's special guards.) Johanan also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.",
  "7": "These people didn't listen to the Lord. So they all went to Egypt to the town of Tahpanhes.",

He is my servant, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here. Nebuchadnezzar will spread his canopy above these stones.",
  "11": "He will come here and attack Egypt. He will bring death to those who are to die. He will bring captivity to those who are to be taken captive. And he will bring the sword to those who are to be killed with a sword.",
  "12": "Nebuchadnezzar will start a fire in the temples of the false gods of Egypt. He will burn the temples and he will take the idols away. Shepherds pick the bugs and thorns off their clothes to make them clean. In the same way Nebuchadnezzar will pick Egypt clean. Then he will safely leave Egypt.",
  "13": "He will destroy the memorial stones that are in the temple of the Sun God in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of the false gods of Egypt.'\""
