These are the names of the officials: Nergal- Sharezer, the governor of the district of Samgar, a very high official; Nebo Sarsekim, another very high official; and various other important officials were there also.",
  "4": "King Zedekiah of Judah saw the officials from Babylon, so he and the soldiers with him ran away. They left Jerusalem at night. They went out through the king's garden and out through the gate that was between the two walls. Then they went toward the desert.",
  "5": "The Babylonian army chased Zedekiah and the soldiers with him. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured Zedekiah and took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar was at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath. At that place, Nebuchadnezzar decided what to do to Zedekiah.",

  "11": "Nebuchadnezzar also gave an order about Jeremiah to commander Nebuzaradan:",
  "12": "\"Find Jeremiah and take care of him. Don't hurt him. Give him whatever he asks for.\"",

  "14": "They had Jeremiah taken out of the Temple yard where he had been under the guard of the king of Judah. They turned Jeremiah over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. Gedaliah had orders to take Jeremiah back home. So Jeremiah was taken home, and he stayed among his own people.",
  "15": "While the guards were watching Jeremiah in the Temple yard, a message from the Lord came to him. This was the message:",
  "16": "\"Jeremiah, go and tell Ebed Melech the Ethiopian this message: 'This is what the Lord All-Powerful, the God of the people of Israel, says: Very soon I will make my messages about this city of Jerusalem come true. My messages will come true through disaster, not through something good. You will see everything come true with your own eyes.",
  "17": "But I will save you on that day, Ebed Melech.' This is the message of the Lord. 'You will not be given to the people you are afraid of.",
  "18": "I will save you, Ebed Melech. You will not die from a sword, but you will escape and live. That will happen because you have trusted in me.'\" This message is from the Lord."
