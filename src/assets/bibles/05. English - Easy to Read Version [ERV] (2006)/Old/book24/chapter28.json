  "4": "I will also bring the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, back to this place.

  "5": "Then the prophet Jeremiah answered the prophet Hananiah. They were standing in the Temple of the Lord. The priests and all the people there could hear Jeremiah's answer.",
  "6": "Jeremiah said to Hananiah, \"Amen! May the Lord do that. May the Lord make the message you say come true. May he bring the things of the Lord's Temple back to this place from Babylon. And may he bring all those who were forced to leave their homes back to this place.",
  "7": "\"But listen to what I must say, Hananiah. Listen to what I say to all you people.",

  "11": "Then Hananiah spoke loudly so that all the people could hear him. He said, \"This is what the Lord says: 'In the same way I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He put that yoke on all the nations of the world, but I will break it before two years are over.'\" After Hananiah said that, Jeremiah left the Temple.",

  "14": "The Lord All-Powerful, the God of Israel, is the one saying this. I will put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations. I will do that to make them serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and they will be slaves to him. I will even give Nebuchadnezzar control over the wild animals.'\"",
  "15": "Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, \"Listen, Hananiah! The Lord did not send you. But you have made the people of Judah trust in lies.",
