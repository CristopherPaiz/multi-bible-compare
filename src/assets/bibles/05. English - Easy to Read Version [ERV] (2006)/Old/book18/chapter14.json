  "2": "Our life is like a flower. It grows quickly and then dies away. Our life is like a shadow that is here for a short time and then is gone.",
  "3": "God, do you need to keep an eye on something so small? Why bother to bring charges against me?",
  "4": "\"No one can make something clean from something so dirty.",
  "5": "The length of our life has been decided. You alone know how long that is. You have set the limits for us and nothing can change them.",
  "6": "So stop watching us. Leave us alone. Let us enjoy this hard life until, like hired workers, we have put in our time.",

  "16": "You would still watch every step I take, but you would not remember my sins.",
  "17": "It would be as if you had sealed my sins in a bag. It would be as if you had covered my guilt with plaster.",
  "18": "\"Mountains fall and crumble away. Large rocks break loose and fall.",
  "19": "Water flowing over stones wears them down. Floods wash away the soil on the ground. In the same way, God, you destroy the hope people have.",
  "20": "You defeat them completely and then they are gone. You change the way they look and send them away forever to the place of death.",
