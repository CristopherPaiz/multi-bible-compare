  "1": "\"People have a hard struggle on earth. Their life is like that of a hired worker.",
  "2": "They are like a slave looking for cool shade or a hired worker waiting for payday.",
  "3": "Month after frustrating month has gone by. I have suffered night after night.",
  "4": "When I lie down, I think, 'How long before it's time to get up?' The night drags on. I toss and turn until the sun comes up.",
  "5": "My skin is covered with worms and scabs. It is cracked and covered with sores.",
  "6": "\"My days pass by faster than a weaver's shuttle, and my life will end without hope.",
  "7": "God, remember, my life is like a breath. I will not get a second chance to enjoy it.",
  "8": "Those who see me now will never see me again. You watch me for a while, but then I am gone.",
  "9": "Just as clouds that come and go, people are put in the grave, never to rise again.",
  "10": "They don't come back to their old homes. The people there would not know them.",
  "11": "\"So I will not be quiet! I will let my suffering spirit speak! I will let my bitter soul complain!",
  "12": "Am I one of your enemies? Is that why you put a guard over me?",
  "13": "My bed should bring me comfort. My couch should give me rest and relief.",
  "14": "But when I lie down, you scare me with dreams; you frighten me with visions.",
  "15": "So I would rather be choked to death than to live like this.",
  "16": "I hate my lifeâ€”I give up. I don't want to live forever. Leave me alone! My life means nothing.",
  "17": "God, why are people so important to you? Why do you even notice them?",
  "18": "Why do you visit them every morning and test them at every moment?",
  "19": "You never look away from me or leave me alone for a second.",
  "20": "You are always watching us! If I sinned, would that hurt you? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a problem for you?",
  "21": "Why don't you just pardon me for doing wrong? Why don't you just forgive me for my sins? Soon I will die and be in my grave. You will search for me, but I will be gone.\""
