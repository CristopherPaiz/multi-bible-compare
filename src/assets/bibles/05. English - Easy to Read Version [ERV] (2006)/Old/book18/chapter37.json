  "1": "\"The thunder and lightning frighten me; my heart pounds in my chest.",
  "2": "Listen to God's thundering voice! Listen to the sound coming from his mouth.",
  "3": "He sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky. It lights up the earth from one end to the other.",
  "4": "After the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice. He thunders with his wonderful voice! And while his voice thunders, the lightning flashes continue.",
  "5": "God's thundering voice is amazing! He does great things that we cannot understand.",
  "6": "He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth.' And he says to the rain, 'Pour down on the earth.'",
  "7": "God does this to stop everyone's work and to show the people he made what he can do.",
  "8": "The animals run into their dens and stay there.",
  "9": "Whirlwinds come from the south. The cold winds come from the north.",
  "10": "God's breath makes ice and freezes even large bodies of water.",
  "11": "He fills the clouds with water and scatters his lightning through them.",
  "12": "He orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth. The clouds do whatever he commands.",
  "13": "He causes the clouds to punish people with floods or to water his earth and show his love.",
  "14": "\"Job, stop for a minute and listen. Think about the wonderful things God does.",

  "19": "\"Job, tell us what we should say to God! We cannot think of what to say because of our ignorance.",
  "20": "I would not tell God that I wanted to talk to him. That would be like asking to be destroyed.",
  "21": "A person cannot look at the sun. It is too bright as it shines in the sky after the wind blows the clouds away.",
  "22": "In the same way God's golden glory shines from the Holy Mountain. He is surrounded by the brightest light.",
  "23": "We have seen that God All-Powerful really is all powerful! But he is just and never treats anyone unfairly.",
  "24": "That is why people fear and respect him. He shows no respect for those who think they are wise.\""
