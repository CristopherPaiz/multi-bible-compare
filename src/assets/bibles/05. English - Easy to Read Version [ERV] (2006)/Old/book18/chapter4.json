  "7": "Can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed? Do you know of any place where good people are punished?",
  "8": "Yes, I have seen people whose lives were cut short, but they were evil troublemakers.",
  "9": "They lost the breath God gave them. They were cut off from his breath of life.",

  "17": "'A person cannot be more right than God. People cannot be more pure than their Maker.",
  "18": "Look, God cannot even trust his heavenly servants. He sees faults even in his angels.",
  "19": "So surely people are worse! They live in houses of clay built on dust. They can be crushed as easily as a moth!",
  "20": "From dawn to sunset people are destroyed. They die—gone forever—and no one even notices.",
  "21": "The ropes of their tent are pulled up, and they die before gaining wisdom.'"
