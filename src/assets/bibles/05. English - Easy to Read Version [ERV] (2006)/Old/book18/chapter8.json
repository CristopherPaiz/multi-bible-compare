  "1": "Then Bildad from Shuah answered:",
  "2": "\"How long will you talk like that? Your words are nothing but hot air!",
  "3": "God is always fair. God All-Powerful does what is right.",
  "4": "If your children sinned against God, he punished them. They paid for their sins.",
  "5": "But now, look to God and pray to the All-Powerful.",
  "6": "If you are pure and good, he will quickly come to help you. He will give your family back to you.",
  "7": "Then you will have a lot more than you had in the beginning!",
  "8": "\"Ask those who are now old. Find out what their ancestors learned.",
  "9": "It seems as though we were born yesterday. We are too young to know anything. Our days on earth are very short, like a shadow.",
  "10": "Maybe the old people can tell you something. Maybe they will teach you what they learned.",
  "11": "\"Can papyrus grow tall on a dry land? Can reeds grow without water?",
  "12": "No, they will dry up before harvest. They will be too small to cut and use.",
  "13": "People who forget God are like that. Those who oppose him have no hope.",
  "14": "They have put their trust in something weak. It is like a spider's web.",
  "15": "When they lean against it, it will break. When they reach out for it, it will not hold them up.",
  "16": "Such people are like a vine that gets plenty of water and sunshine, and its branches spread throughout the garden.",
  "17": "Its roots spread among the rocks, searching for good soil.",
  "18": "But if you move it, it will die, and no one can tell it was ever there.",
  "19": "Everything might have been going well, but another vine will take its place.",
  "20": "God does not support evil people, and he does not abandon the innocent.",
  "21": "So perhaps you might laugh again. Maybe shouts of joy will come from your lips.",
  "22": "Maybe your enemies will be humiliated and the homes of the wicked destroyed.\""
