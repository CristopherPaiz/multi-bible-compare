  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"How long will you hurt me and crush me with your words?",
  "3": "You have insulted me ten times now. You have attacked me without shame!",
  "4": "Even if I have sinned, it is my problem, not yours!",
  "5": "You want me to look bad to make yourselves look good. You say my troubles are proof that I did wrong.",
  "6": "I want you to know it was God who did this. He set this trap for me.",
  "7": "I shout, 'He hurt me!' but get no answer. No one hears my cry for fairness.",
  "8": "God has blocked my way to keep me from getting through. He has hidden my path in darkness.",
  "9": "He took away my honor. He took the crown from my head.",
  "10": "He hits me on every side until I am worn out. He takes away my hope. It is like a tree pulled up by the roots.",
  "11": "His anger burns against me. He treats me like an enemy.",
  "12": "He sends his army to attack me. They build attack towers around me. They camp around my tent.",
  "13": "\"God has made my brothers hate me. Those who knew me have become strangers.",
  "14": "My relatives have left me. My friends have forgotten me.",
  "15": "My servant girls and visitors in my home look at me as if I am a stranger and a foreigner.",
  "16": "I call for my servant, but he does not answer. Even if I beg for help, he will not answer.",
  "17": "My wife hates the smell of my breath. My own brothers hate me.",
  "18": "Even little children make fun of me. When I get up, they say bad things about me.",
  "19": "All my close friends hate me. Even my loved ones have turned against me.",
  "20": "\"I am so thin, my skin hangs loose on my bones. I have little life left in me.",
  "21": "\"Pity me, my friends, pity me, because God is against me.",
  "22": "Why do you persecute me like God does? Don't you get tired of hurting me?",
  "23": "\"I wish someone would write down everything I say. I wish my words were written on a scroll.",
  "24": "I wish they were carved with an iron tool into lead or scratched on a rock so that they would last forever.",
  "25": "I know that there is someone to defend me and that he lives! And in the end, he will stand here on earth and defend me.",
  "26": "After I leave my body and my skin has been destroyed, I know I will still see God.",
  "27": "I will see him with my own eyes. I myself, not someone else, will see God. And I cannot tell you how excited that makes me feel!",
  "28": "\"Maybe you will say, 'How can we push Job a little harder and make him realize that he is the source of his problems?'",
  "29": "But you need to worry about your own punishment. God might use the sword against you so that you will know that there is a time of judgment.\""
