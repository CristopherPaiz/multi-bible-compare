  "1": "Then Eliphaz from Teman answered Job:",
  "2": "\"If you were really wise, you would not answer with your worthless personal opinions! A wise man would not be so full of hot air.",
  "3": "Do you think a wise man would use empty words and meaningless speeches to win his arguments?",
  "4": "If you had your way, no one would respect God and pray to him.",
  "5": "What you say clearly shows your sin. Job, you are trying to hide your sin by using clever words.",
  "6": "I don't need to prove to you that you are wrong. The words from your own mouth show that you are wrong. Your own lips speak against you.",
  "7": "\"Do you think you were the first person ever to be born? Were you born before the hills?",
  "8": "Did you listen to God's secret plans? Do you think you are the only wise person?",
  "9": "We know as much as you do! We understand as well as you.",
  "10": "The old, gray-haired men agree with us. People older than your father are on our side.",
  "11": "God tries to comfort you, but that is not enough for you. We have spoken his message to you in a gentle way.",
  "12": "Why will you not understand? Why can you not see the truth?",
  "13": "You are expressing your anger against God when you say these things.",
  "14": "\"People cannot really be pure. They cannot be more right than God!",
  "15": "God does not even trust his angels. He does not even think the sky is pure.",
  "16": "People are even worse. They are disgusting and dirty. They drink up evil like water.",
  "17": "\"Listen to me, and I will explain it to you. Let me tell you what I have seen.",
  "18": "I will tell you what wise men would say, things they heard from their fathers and then freely passed on. They didn't hide any secrets from me.",
  "19": "These are important people in our country! Everyone knows who they are.",
  "20": "And they said that an evil man suffers all his life. A cruel man suffers all his numbered years.",
  "21": "Every noise scares him. His enemy will attack him when he thinks he is safe.",
  "22": "An evil man has no hope of escaping the darkness. There is a sword somewhere waiting to kill him.",
  "23": "He wanders from place to place, looking for food. But he knows a dark day is coming, which he brought on himself.",
  "24": "He lives in fear, with worry and suffering threatening him like a king ready to attack.",
  "25": "That is because that evil man shook his fist at God, refusing to obey. He dared to attack God All-Powerful,",
  "26": "like a soldier with a thick, strong shield who runs at his enemy to strike him in the neck.",
  "27": "He might be rich and fat,",
  "28": "but his town will be ruined; his home will be destroyed; his house will be empty.",
  "29": "He will not be rich for long. His wealth will not last. His crops will not grow large.",
  "30": "He will not escape the darkness. He will be like a tree whose leaves die from disease and are blown away by the wind.",
  "31": "That evil man should not fool himself by trusting in worthless things, because he will keep nothing.",
  "32": "He will die before his time, like a tree whose top branches have already begun to die.",
  "33": "He will be like a vine that loses its grapes before they ripen. He will be like an olive tree that loses its buds.",
  "34": "That is because people without God have nothing. Those who take bribes will have their homes destroyed by fire.",
  "35": "These are people who are always thinking of ways to do evil and cause trouble. They are always planning how they might cheat others.\""
