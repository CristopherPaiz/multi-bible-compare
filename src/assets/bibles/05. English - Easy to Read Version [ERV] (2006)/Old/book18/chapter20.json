  "1": "Then Zophar from Naamah answered:",
  "2": "\"You upset me, so I must answer you. I must tell you what I am thinking.",
  "3": "You insulted me with your answers! But I am wise and know how to answer you.",
  "4": "\"You know that the joy of the wicked does not last long. That has been true a long time, ever since Adam was put on earth. Those who don't know God are happy for only a short time.",
  "5": "",
  "6": "Maybe an evil man's pride will reach up to the sky, and his head will touch the clouds.",
  "7": "But he will be gone forever, like his own body waste. People who knew him will say, 'Where is he?'",
  "8": "Like a dream, he will fly away, never to be found. He will be chased away like a bad dream.",
  "9": "Those who knew him before will not see him again. His family will never again get to see him.",
  "10": "His children will give back what he took from the poor, and his own hands must give back his wealth.",
  "11": "When he was young, his bones were strong, but, like the rest of his body, they will soon lie in the dirt.",
  "12": "\"Evil tastes sweet in his mouth. He keeps it under his tongue to enjoy it fully.",
  "13": "He hates to let it go and holds it in his mouth.",
  "14": "But that evil will turn sour in his stomach. It will be like a snake's bitter poison inside him.",

  "18": "He will be forced to give back his profits. He will not be allowed to enjoy what he worked for,",
  "19": "because he hurt the poor and left them with nothing. He took houses he did not build.",
  "20": "\"The evil man is never satisfied. But the things he wants cannot save him.",
  "21": "After filling himself, there is nothing left. His success will not continue.",
  "22": "Even while he has plenty, he will be pressed down with trouble. His problems will come down on him!",
  "23": "If he does get all he wants, God will throw his burning anger against him. God will attack him and rain down punishment on him.",
  "24": "Maybe he will run away from an iron sword, but then a bronze arrow will strike him down.",
  "25": "It will go through his body and stick out of his back. Its shining point will pierce his liver, and he will be shocked with terror.",
  "26": "All his treasures will be lost in darkness. He will be destroyed by a fire, a fire that no human started. It will destroy everything left in his house.",
  "27": "Heaven will prove that he is guilty. The earth will be a witness against him.",
  "28": "His house and everything in it will be carried away in the flood of God's anger.",
  "29": "That is what God will do to those who are evil. That is what he plans to give them.\""
