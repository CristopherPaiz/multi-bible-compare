  "1": "Then Job's three friends gave up trying to answer him, because he was so sure that he was innocent.",
  "2": "But there was a young man there named Elihu son of Barakel. He was a descendant of a man named Buz. Elihu was from the family of Ram. He became very angry because Job kept saying he was innocentâ€”that he was right and God was wrong.",
  "3": "Elihu was also angry with Job's three friends because they could not answer him, and yet they still considered him guilty of doing wrong.",
  "4": "Elihu was the youngest one there, so he had waited until everyone finished talking.",
  "5": "But when he saw that Job's three friends had nothing more to say, his anger forced him to speak.",
  "6": "So here's what Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: \"I am only a young man, and you are all older. That is why I was afraid to tell you what I think.",
  "7": "I thought to myself, 'Older people should speak first. They have lived many years, so they have learned many things.'",
  "8": "But it is the spirit in people, the breath from God All-Powerful, that makes them understand.",
  "9": "Old men are not the only wise people. They are not the only ones who understand what is right.",
  "10": "\"So please listen to me, and I will tell you what I think.",
  "11": "I waited patiently while you men talked. I listened to the answers you gave as you searched for the right words.",
  "12": "I listened carefully to what you said. Not one of you proved Job wrong. Not one of you answered his arguments.",
  "13": "You men cannot say that you have found wisdom. The answer to Job's arguments must come from God, not people.",
  "14": "Job was arguing with you, not me, so I will not use your arguments to answer him.",
  "15": "\"Job, these men lost the argument. They don't have anything more to say. They don't have any more answers.",
  "16": "I waited for them to answer you. But now they are quiet. They stand there with nothing more to say.",
  "17": "So now I will give you my answer. Yes, I will tell you what I think.",
  "18": "I have so much to say that I cannot hold it in.",
  "19": "I feel like a jar of wine that has never been opened. I am like a new wineskin ready to burst.",
  "20": "I must speak so that I will feel better. I must answer your arguments.",
  "21": "I will treat you the same as I would treat anyone else. I will not praise you to win your favor.",
  "22": "I cannot treat one person better than another. If I did, God my Maker would punish me!"
