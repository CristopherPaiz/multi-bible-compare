  "2": "I know as much as you do. I am as smart as you are.",
  "3": "But I don't want to argue with you. I want to speak to God All-Powerful. I want to argue with God about my troubles.",
  "4": "But you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies. You are like worthless doctors who cannot heal anyone.",
  "5": "I wish you would just be quiet. That would be the wisest thing you could do.",
  "6": "\"Now, listen to my argument. Listen to what I have to say.",
  "7": "Will you speak lies for God? Do you really believe your lies are what God wants you to say?",
  "8": "Are you trying to defend God against me? You are not being fair. You are choosing God's side simply because he is God.",
  "9": "If God checked you very closely, would he see that you are right? Do you really think you can fool God the same as you fool people?",
  "10": "You know that God would criticize you if you chose someone's side simply because they were important.",
  "11": "God's majesty frightens you. You are afraid of him.",
  "12": "The wise sayings you quote are worthless. Your arguments are as weak as clay.",
  "13": "\"Be quiet and let me talk! I accept whatever happens to me.",
  "14": "I will put myself in danger and take my life in my own hands.",
  "15": "I will continue to trust God even if he kills me. But I will defend myself to his face.",
  "16": "And if he lets me live, it will be because I had the confidence to speak. No guilty person would dare meet God face to face.",
  "17": "Listen carefully to what I say. Let me explain.",
  "18": "I am ready now to defend myself. I will carefully present my arguments. I know I will be shown to be right.",
  "19": "If anyone can prove I am wrong, I will shut up and wait to die.",
  "20": "\"God, just give me two things, and then I will not hide from you:",
  "21": "Stop punishing me, and don't frighten me with your terrors.",
  "22": "Then call to me, and I will answer you. Or let me speak, and you answer me.",
  "23": "How many sins have I committed? What wrongs have I done? Show me where I went wrong or how I sinned.",
  "24": "God, why do you avoid me and treat me like your enemy?",
  "25": "Are you trying to scare me? I am only a leaf blowing in the wind. You are attacking a piece of straw!",
  "26": "You have a list of terrible charges against me. Are you making me suffer for the sins I did when I was young?",
  "27": "You have put chains on my feet. You watch every step I take. You see every move I make.",
  "28": "So I am becoming weaker and weaker, like a piece of wood rotting away, like a piece of cloth eaten by moths."
