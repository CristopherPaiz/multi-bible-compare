  "4": "They pull up salt plants in the desert and eat the roots from the broom tree.",
  "5": "They are forced away from other people, who shout at them as if they were thieves.",
  "6": "They must live in the dry riverbeds, hillside caves, and holes in the ground.",
  "7": "They howl in the bushes and huddle together under thornbushes.",
  "8": "They are a bunch of worthless people without names, who were forced to leave their country.",
  "9": "\"Now their sons sing songs to make fun of me. My name has become a bad word to them.",

  "11": "God has taken the string from my bow and made me weak, so they feel free to do whatever they want to me.",
  "12": "They attack me on my right side. They knock my feet out from under me. They build ramps to attack and destroy me like a city.",
  "13": "They guard the road so that I cannot escape. They succeed in destroying me, without help from anyone.",

  "26": "But when I hoped for good, trouble came instead. When I looked for light, darkness came.",
  "27": "I constantly feel upset. And my suffering has only just begun.",
  "28": "I am always sad and depressed, without any relief. I stand up in the public meeting and cry for help,",

  "31": "My harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow. My flute makes sad sounds like someone crying."
