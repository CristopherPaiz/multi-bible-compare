  "1": "\"Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook? Can you tie his tongue with a rope?",
  "2": "Can you put a rope through his nose or a hook through his jaw?",
  "3": "Will he beg you to let him go free? Will he speak to you with gentle words?",
  "4": "Will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever?",
  "5": "Will you play with Leviathan as you would play with a bird? Will you put a rope on him so that your girls can play with him?",
  "6": "Will fishermen try to buy him from you? Will they cut him into pieces and sell him to the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you throw spears into his skin or head?",
  "8": "\"If you ever lay a hand on Leviathan, you will never do it again! Just think about the battle that would be!",
  "9": "Do you think you can defeat him? Well, forget it! There is no hope. Just looking at him will scare you!",
  "10": "No one is brave enough to wake him up and make him angry. \"Well, no one can challenge me either!",
  "11": "I owe nothing to anyone. Everything under heaven belongs to me.",
  "12": "\"I will tell you about Leviathan's legs, his strength, and his graceful shape.",
  "13": "No one can pierce his skin. It is like armor!",
  "14": "No one can force him to open his jaws. The teeth in his mouth scare people.",
  "15": "His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together.",
  "16": "They are so close to each other that no air can pass between them.",
  "17": "The shields are joined to each other. They hold together so tightly that they cannot be pulled apart.",
  "18": "When Leviathan sneezes, it is like lightning flashing out. His eyes shine like the light of dawn.",
  "19": "Burning torches come from his mouth. Sparks of fire shoot out.",
  "20": "Smoke pours from his nose like burning weeds under a boiling pot.",
  "21": "His breath sets coals on fire, and flames shoot from his mouth.",
  "22": "His neck is very powerful. People are afraid and run away from him.",
  "23": "There is no soft spot in his skin. It is as hard as iron.",
  "24": "His heart is like a rock; he has no fear. It is as hard as a lower millstone.",
  "25": "When he gets up, even the strongest people are afraid. They run away when he swings his tail.",
  "26": "Swords, spears, and darts only bounce off when they hit him. These weapons don't hurt him at all!",
  "27": "He breaks iron as easily as straw. He breaks bronze like rotten wood.",
  "28": "Arrows don't make him run away. Rocks thrown at him seem as light as chaff.",
  "29": "When a wood club hits him, it feels to him like a piece of straw. He laughs when anyone throws a spear at him.",
  "30": "The skin on his belly is like sharp pieces of broken pottery. He leaves tracks in the mud like a threshing board.",
  "31": "He stirs up the water like a boiling pot. He makes it bubble like a pot of boiling oil.",
  "32": "When he swims, he leaves a sparkling path behind him. He stirs up the water and makes it white with foam.",
  "33": "No animal on earth is like him. He is an animal made without fear.",
  "34": "He looks down on the proudest of creatures. He is king over all the wild animals.\""
