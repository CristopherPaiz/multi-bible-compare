  "1": "Then Eliphaz from Teman answered:",
  "2": "\"Does God need our help? Even the wisest of us is not really useful to him.",
  "3": "Does your living right benefit him? Does God All-Powerful gain anything if you follow him?",
  "4": "Why does God blame and punish you? Is it because you worship him?",
  "5": "No, it is because you sin so much. You never stop sinning.",
  "6": "Maybe to guarantee loans you took things from people for no reason. Maybe you took a poor man's clothes to make sure he paid you back.",
  "7": "Maybe you failed to give water or food to people who were tired or hungry.",
  "8": "You have a lot of farmland, and people respect you.",
  "9": "But maybe you sent widows away without giving them anything. And maybe you took advantage of orphans.",
  "10": "That is why traps are all around you, and sudden trouble makes you afraid.",
  "11": "That is why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.",
  "12": "\"God lives in the highest part of heaven and looks down on the highest stars.",
  "13": "But you might say, 'What does God know? Can he see through the dark clouds to judge us?",
  "14": "Thick clouds hide us from his eyes, so he cannot see us as he walks around the edge of the sky.'",
  "15": "\"Job, you are walking on the old path that evil people walked on long ago.",
  "16": "They were destroyed before it was their time to die. They were washed away by the flood.",
  "17": "They told God, 'Leave us alone!' and said, 'God All-Powerful cannot do anything to us!'",
  "18": "And it was God who filled their houses with good things. No, I would never follow the advice of evil people.",
  "19": "Those who do what is right are happy to see them destroyed. The innocent laugh at them and say,",
  "20": "'Surely our enemies are destroyed! Their wealth burned up in the fire!'",
  "21": "\"Now, Job, give yourself to God and make peace with him. Do this, and you will get many good things.",
  "22": "Accept his teaching. Pay attention to what he says.",
  "23": "If you return to God All-Powerful, you will be restored. But remove the evil from your house.",
  "24": "Think of your gold as nothing but dirt. Think of your finest gold as rocks from a stream.",
  "25": "And let God All-Powerful be your gold. Let him be your pile of silver.",
  "26": "Then you will enjoy God All-Powerful, and you will look up to him.",
  "27": "When you pray, he will hear you. And you will be able to do all that you promised him.",
  "28": "If you decide to do something, it will be successful. And your future will be very bright!",
  "29": "When people are brought down and you ask God to help them, he will rescue those who have been humbled.",
  "30": "Even those who are guilty will be forgiven. They will be saved because you did what was right.\""
