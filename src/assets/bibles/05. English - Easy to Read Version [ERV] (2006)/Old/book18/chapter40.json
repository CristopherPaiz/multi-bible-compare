  "1": "Then the Lord said to Job,",
  "2": "\"You wanted to argue with God All-Powerful. You wanted to correct me and prove that I was wrong. So give me your answer!\"",
  "3": "Then Job answered the Lord:",
  "4": "\"I am not worthy to speak! What can I say to you? I cannot answer you! I will put my hand over my mouth.",
  "5": "I spoke once, but I will not speak again. I spoke twice, but I will not say anything more.\"",
  "6": "Then the Lord spoke to Job again from the storm:",
  "7": "\"Brace yourself and get ready to answer the questions I will ask you.",
  "8": "\"Are you trying to show that I am unfair? Are you trying to look innocent by saying that I am guilty?",
  "9": "Are your arms as strong as mine? Do you have a voice like mine that is as loud as thunder?",
  "10": "If so, you can be proud and wear glory and honor like clothes.",
  "11": "If you are as powerful as God, then show your anger! Punish those who are proud and humble them.",
  "12": "Yes, just look at the proud and make them humble. Crush those evil people where they stand.",
  "13": "Bury them all in the dirt. Wrap their bodies up and put them in their graves.",
  "14": "If you can do any of these things, then even I will praise you. And I will admit that you can save yourself by your own power.",
  "15": "\"Look at the behemoth. I made the behemoth, and I made you. He eats grass like a cow.",
  "16": "But he has great strength in his body. The muscles in his stomach are powerful.",
  "17": "His tail stands strong like a cedar tree. His leg muscles are very strong.",
  "18": "His bones are as strong as bronze. His legs are like iron bars.",
  "19": "The behemoth is the most amazing animal I made, but I can defeat him.",
  "20": "He eats the grass that grows on the hills where the wild animals play.",
  "21": "He lies under the lotus plants. He hides among the reeds of the swamp.",
  "22": "The lotus plants hide him in their shade. He lives under the willow trees that grow near the river.",
  "23": "If the river floods, the behemoth will not run away. He is not afraid if the Jordan River splashes on his face.",
  "24": "No one can blind his eyes and capture him. No one can catch him in a trap."
