  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"I have heard all these things before. You men give me trouble, not comfort.",
  "3": "Your long speeches never end! Why do you continue arguing?",
  "4": "I also could say the same things you say, if you had my troubles. I could say wise things against you and shake my head at you.",

  "19": "Even now there is someone in heaven who will speak for me. There is someone above who will testify for me.",
  "20": "My friend speaks for me, while my eyes pour out tears to God.",
  "21": "He speaks to God for me, like someone presenting an argument for a friend.",
  "22": "\"In only a few years I will go to that place of no return."
