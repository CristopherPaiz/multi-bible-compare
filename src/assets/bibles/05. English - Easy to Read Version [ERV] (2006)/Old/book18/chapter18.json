  "18": "They will be forced from light into darkness. They will be chased out of this world.",
  "19": "They will leave behind no children, no descendants. None of their people will be left alive.",
  "20": "People in the west will be shocked at what happened to them. People in the east will be numb with fear.",
  "21": "This is what will happen to the homes of those who are evil. This is the place of those who don't know God!\""
