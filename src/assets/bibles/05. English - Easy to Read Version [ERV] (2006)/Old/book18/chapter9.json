  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"Of course, I know that this is true. But how can a human being win an argument with God?",
  "3": "Anyone who chose to argue with him could not answer one question in a thousand!",
  "4": "God is so wise and powerful that no one could oppose him and survive.",
  "5": "When God is angry, he moves mountains before they know what happened.",
  "6": "He can shake the earth, and it will tremble down to its foundations.",
  "7": "With one command he can stop the sun from rising. He can lock up the stars and keep them from shining.",
  "8": "He alone made the skies, and he walks on the ocean waves.",
  "9": "\"God made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades. He made the planets that cross the southern sky.",
  "10": "He does things too marvelous for people to understand. He does too many miracles to count!",
  "11": "When he passes by, I cannot see him. He goes right past me, and I don't notice.",
  "12": "If he takes something away, no one can stop him. No one can say to him, 'What are you doing?'",
  "13": "God will not hold back his anger. Even Rahab's helpers are afraid of him.",
  "14": "So I cannot argue with God. I would not know what to say to him.",
  "15": "I am innocent, but I cannot give him an answer. All I can do is beg my Judge for mercy.",
  "16": "Even if I called and he answered, I cannot believe he would listen to me.",
  "17": "He would just send storms to crush me. He would give me more wounds for no reason.",
  "18": "He would not let me catch my breath again. He would just give me more trouble.",
  "19": "I cannot defeat God. He is too powerful! I cannot take him to court for justice. Who could force him to come?",
  "20": "I am innocent, but anything I say makes me seem guilty. I am innocent, but if I speak, my mouth proves me wrong.",
  "21": "I am innocent, but I don't know what to think. I hate my own life.",
  "22": "So I say, 'Does it make any difference? God destroys the innocent as well as the guilty.'",
  "23": "Does God just laugh when a disaster kills innocent people?",
  "24": "Is it God who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control? If it is not God, then who is it?",
  "25": "\"My days are passing faster than a runner. They are flying by without any joy.",
  "26": "They go by as quickly as papyrus boats, as fast as an eagle swooping down on its prey.",
  "27": "\"I could say, 'I will not complain. I will forget my pain and put a smile on my face.'",
  "28": "But the suffering still frightens me. I know that God will not see me as innocent.",
  "29": "I will be found guilty, so why should I even think about it?",
  "30": "Even if I scrubbed my hands with soap and washed myself whiter than snow,",
  "31": "God would still push me into the slime pit, and even my clothes would hate to touch me.",
  "32": "God is not a human like me, so I cannot argue with him. I cannot take him to court.",
  "33": "I wish there were someone who could listen to both sides, someone to judge both of us in a fair way.",
  "34": "I wish someone could take away the threat of God's punishment. Then he would not frighten me anymore.",
  "35": "Then I could say what I want without being afraid of him. But I cannot do that now."
