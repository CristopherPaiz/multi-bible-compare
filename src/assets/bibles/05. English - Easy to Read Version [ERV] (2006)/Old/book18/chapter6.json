  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"I wish my suffering could be weighed and all my trouble be put on the scales.",
  "3": "They would be heavier than all the sand of the sea! That is why my words are so crazy.",
  "4": "God All-Powerful has shot me with his arrows. My spirit feels their poison! God's terrible weapons are lined up against me.",
  "5": "Even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat. And a cow is quiet when it has food.",
  "6": "Food without salt does not taste good, and the white of an egg has no taste.",
  "7": "I refuse to touch that kind of food; it makes me sick!",
  "8": "\"I wish I could have what I ask for. I wish God would give me what I want.",
  "9": "I wish he would crush meâ€” just go ahead and kill me!",
  "10": "Then I would be comforted by this one thing: even through all this pain I never refused to obey the commands of the Holy One.",
  "11": "\"With my strength gone, I have no hope to go on living. With nothing to look forward to, why should I be patient?",
  "12": "I am not strong like a rock. My body is not made from bronze.",
  "13": "I don't have the power to help myself, because all hope of success has been taken away from me.",
  "14": "\"Friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble, even if you turn away from God All-Powerful.",
  "15": "But I cannot depend on you, my brothers. You are like a stream that has no water when the weather is dry but is flooded when the rains come.",
  "16": "In the winter, it is choked with ice and melting snow.",
  "17": "But when the weather is hot and dry, the water stops flowing, and the stream disappears.",
  "18": "It twists and turns along the way and then disappears into the desert.",
  "19": "Traders from Tema search for it. Travelers from Sheba hope to find it.",
  "20": "They are sure they can find water, but they will be disappointed.",
  "21": "Now, you are like those streams. You see my troubles and are afraid.",
  "22": "But have I ever asked you to help me? Did I ask you to offer a bribe for me from your wealth?",
  "23": "No, and I never said, 'Save me from my enemies!' or 'Save me from those who are cruel!'",
  "24": "\"So now, teach me, and I will be quiet. Show me what I have done wrong.",
  "25": "Honest words are powerful, but your arguments prove nothing.",
  "26": "Do you plan to criticize me? Will you speak more tiring words?",
  "27": "Are you the kind of people who would gamble for orphans and sell out your own friends?",
  "28": "Now, look me in the face, and see that I am telling the truth!",
  "29": "You need to start over and stop being so unfair! Think again, because I am innocent.",
  "30": "I am not lying. I know right from wrong."
