  "4": "\"Where were you when I made the earth? If you are so smart, answer me.",
  "5": "And who decided how big the earth should be? Who measured it with a measuring line?",
  "6": "What is the earth resting on? Who put the first stone in its place",
  "7": "when the morning stars sang together and the angels shouted with joy?",
  "8": "\"Who closed the flood gates as the sea gushed from the womb?",
  "9": "Who covered it with clouds and wrapped it in darkness?",
  "10": "I set the limits for the sea and put it behind locked gates.",
  "11": "I said to the sea, 'You can come this far, but no farther. This is where your proud waves will stop.'",
  "12": "\"Did you ever in your life command the morning to begin or the day to dawn?",
  "13": "Did you ever tell the morning light to grab the earth and shake those who are evil out of their hiding places?",
  "14": "The morning light makes the hills and valleys easy to see. When the daylight comes to the earth, the shapes of these places stand out like the folds of a coat. They take shape like soft clay that is pressed with a stamp.",
  "15": "Evil people don't like the daylight. When it shines bright, it keeps them from doing the bad things they do.",

  "19": "\"Where does light come from? Where does darkness come from?",
  "20": "Can you take them back to where they belong? Do you know how to get there?",
  "21": "Surely you know these things, since you are so old and wise. You were alive when I made them, weren't you?",
  "22": "\"Have you ever gone into the storerooms where I keep the snow and the hail?",
  "23": "I save them there for times of trouble, for the times of war and battle.",
  "24": "Have you ever gone to the place where the sun comes up, where it makes the east wind blow all over the earth?",
  "25": "Who dug ditches in the sky for the heavy rain? Who made a path for the thunderstorm?",
  "26": "Who makes it rain even in desert places where no one lives?",
  "27": "The rain gives that dry empty land all the water it needs, and grass begins to grow.",
  "28": "Does the rain have a father? Who produces the drops of dew?",
  "29": "Does ice have a mother? Who gives birth to the frost?",
  "30": "That's when the water freezes as hard as a rock. Even the deep sea freezes over!",
  "31": "\"Can you tie up the Pleiades? Can you unfasten the belt of Orion?",
  "32": "Can you bring out the constellations at the right times? Or can you lead out the Bear with its cubs?",
  "33": "Do you know the laws that control the sky? Can you put each star in its place above the earth?",
  "34": "\"Can you shout at the clouds and command them to cover you with rain?",
