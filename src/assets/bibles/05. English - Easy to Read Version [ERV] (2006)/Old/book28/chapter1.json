  "3": "So Hosea married Gomer daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Hosea.",
  "4": "The Lord said to Hosea, \"Name him Jezreel, because soon I will punish the family of Jehu for the people he killed at Jezreel Valley. Then I will put an end to the kingdom of the nation of Israel.",

  "11": "\"Then the people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together. They will choose one ruler for themselves, and their nation will be too large for the land. Jezreel's day will be great!\""
