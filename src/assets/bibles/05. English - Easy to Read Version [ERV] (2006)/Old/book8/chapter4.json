  "3": "Then Boaz spoke to the close relative. He said, \"Naomi came back from the hill country of Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.",
  "4": "I decided to tell you about this in front of the people living here and in front of the elders of my people. If you want to buy back the land, buy it. If you don't want to redeem the land, tell me. I know that I am the next one after you who can redeem the land. If you don't buy the land back, I will.\"",

  "6": "The close relative answered, \"I cannot buy back the land. That land should belong to me, but I cannot buy it. If I do, I might lose my own land. So you can buy the land.\"",
  "7": "(Long ago in Israel, when people bought or redeemed property, one person took off a shoe and gave it to the other person. This was their proof of purchase.)",

  "14": "The women told Naomi, \"Praise the Lord who gave you this child. He will become famous in Israel.",
  "15": "He will make you alive again, and care for you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law made it happen. She bore this child for you. She loves you, and she is better for you than seven sons.\"",
  "16": "Naomi took the boy, held him in her arms, and cared for him.",
  "17": "The neighbors gave the boy his name. These women said, \"Naomi has a son now!\" They named him Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.",
