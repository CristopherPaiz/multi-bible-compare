Ahaziah's father's name was Jehoram, the king of Judah. Joram's father's name was Ahab. Joram was in the town of Jezreel because he was wounded.",

They said, \"Ahaziah is the descendant of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat followed the Lord with all his heart.\" Ahaziah's family had no power to hold the kingdom of Judah together.",

Jehoiada was a priest, and Jehosheba was Ahaziah's sister. Athaliah did not kill Joash, because Jehosheba hid him.",
