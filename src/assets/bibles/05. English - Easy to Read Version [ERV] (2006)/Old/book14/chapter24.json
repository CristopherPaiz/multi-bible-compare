  "6": "So King Joash called Jehoiada the leading priest. The king said, \"Jehoiada, why haven't you made the Levites bring in the tax money from Judah and Jerusalem? Moses the Lord's servant and the Israelites used that tax money for the Tent of the Agreement. \"",
  "7": "In the past, Athaliah's sons broke into God's Temple and used the holy things in the Lord's Temple for their worship of the Baal gods. Athaliah was a very wicked woman.",
  "8": "King Joash gave a command for a box to be made and put outside the gate at the Lord's Temple.",
  "9": "Then the Levites made an announcement in Judah and Jerusalem. They told the people to bring in the tax money for the Lord. That tax money is what Moses the servant of God had required the Israelites to give while they were in the desert.",
  "10": "All the leaders and the people were happy. They brought their money and put it in the box. They continued giving until the box was full.",
  "11": "Then the Levites would take the box to the king's officials. They saw that the box was full of money. The king's secretary and the leading priest's officer came and took the money out of the box. Then they took the box back to its place again. They did this often and gathered much money.",
  "12": "Then King Joash and Jehoiada gave the money to the people who worked on the Lord's Temple.

They also hired workers who knew how to work with iron and bronze to rebuild the Lord's Temple.",
  "13": "The men who supervised the work were very faithful. The work to rebuild the Lord's Temple was successful. They built God's Temple the way it was before and they made it stronger.",
  "14": "When the workers finished, they brought the money that was left to King Joash and Jehoiada. They used that money to make things for the Lord's Temple. These things were used for the service in the Temple and for offering burnt offerings. They also made bowls and other things from gold and silver. The priests offered burnt offerings in the Lord's Temple every day while Jehoiada was alive.",
  "15": "Jehoiada became old. He had a very long life, and he died when he was 130 years old.",

  "17": "After Jehoiada died, the leaders of Judah came and bowed to King Joash. The king listened to the leaders.",
  "18": "The king and these leaders rejected the Temple of the Lord God. Their ancestors followed the Lord God. They worshiped the Asherah poles and other idols. God was angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem because the king and those leaders were guilty.",

  "22": "Joash the king didn't remember Jehoiada's kindness to him. Jehoiada was Zechariah's father. But Joash killed Zechariah, Jehoiada's son. Before Zechariah died, he said, \"May the Lord see what you are doing and punish you!\"",
  "23": "At the end of the year, the Aramean army came against Joash. They attacked Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the valuable things to the king of Damascus.",
  "24": "The Aramean army came with a small group of men, but the Lord let them defeat a very large army from Judah. The Lord did this because the people of Judah left the Lord God their ancestors followed. So Joash was punished.",
  "25": "When the Arameans left Joash, he was badly wounded. His own servants made plans against him. They did this because Joash killed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest. The servants killed Joash on his own bed. After he died, the people buried him in the City of David. But they didn't bury him in the place where the kings are buried.",
  "26": "These are the servants who made plans against Joash: Zabad and Jehozabad. Zabad's mother's name was Shimeath. Shimeath was from Ammon. And Jehozabad's mother's name was Shimrith. Shimrith was from Moab.",
