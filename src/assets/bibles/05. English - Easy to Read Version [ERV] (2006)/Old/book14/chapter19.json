  "4": "Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he would go out among the people throughout Judah, from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim. He helped the people turn back to the Lord, the God who their ancestors worshiped.",
  "5": "Jehoshaphat went from town to town and appointed judges in each of the fortresses of Judah.",
  "6": "He told the judges, \"Be careful in what you are doing, because you are not judging for people, but for the Lord. The Lord will be with you when you make decisions.",

  "9": "Jehoshaphat commanded them, \"You must serve faithfully with all your heart. You must fear the Lord.",
  "10": "People from cities around the country will bring their problems to you. You will listen to cases where people have broken a law or a command or maybe killed someone. In all of these cases you must warn the people not to sin against the Lord. You must do this so that the Lord will not become angry and punish you and the people.",
  "11": "\"Amariah is the high priest, so he will make the final decision about the people's responsibilities to the Lord. Zebadiah son of Ishmael is the leader of the tribe of Judah, so he will make the final decision about the people's responsibilities to the king. The Levites will serve as scribes for you. Be brave and do what is right! May the Lord be with those of you who are good judges.\""
