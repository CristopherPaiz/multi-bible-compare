The priests blew their trumpets as they stood across from the Levites. And all the Israelites were standing.",
  "7": "King Solomon also dedicated the yard in front of the Temple. He offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat from the animals that were used as fellowship offerings. King Solomon made these offerings there in the yard. He did this because the bronze altar in front of the Lord was too small to hold them all.",
  "8": "So there at the Temple, King Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the festival. People came from as far away as Hamath Pass in the north and the border of Egypt in the south. This huge crowd of people who ate, drank, and enjoyed themselves together with the Lord for seven days.",

  "13": "When I close the sky so that there is no rain, or command the locusts to destroy the land, or send sicknesses to my people",
  "14": "and if my people who are called by my name become humble and pray, and look for me, and turn away from their evil ways, then I will hear them from heaven. I will forgive their sin and heal their land.",
  "15": "Now, my eyes are open, and my ears will pay attention to the prayers prayed in this place.",
  "16": "I have chosen this Temple, and I have made it a holy place. So I will be honored there forever. I will watch over it and think of it always.",
  "17": "You must serve me with a pure and honest heart, just as your father David did. You must obey my laws and do everything that I commanded you. If you obey all I have commanded, and if you obey my laws and rules,",

  "20": "then I will take the Israelites out from my land that I gave them. And I will leave this Temple that I have made holy for my name. I will make this Temple something that all the nations will speak evil about.",
  "21": "Everyone who sees it will be amazed. They will ask, 'Why did the Lord do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple?'",
  "22": "People will say, 'This happened because they left the Lord their God. He brought their ancestors out of Egypt, but they decided to follow other gods. They began to worship and to serve those gods. That is why the Lord caused all these bad things to happen to them.'\""
