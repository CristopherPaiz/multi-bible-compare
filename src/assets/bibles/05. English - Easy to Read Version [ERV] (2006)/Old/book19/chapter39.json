  "2": "So I didn't say anything. I didn't even say anything good, but I became even more upset.",
  "3": "I was very angry, and the more I thought about it, the angrier I became. So I said something.",
  "4": "Lord, tell me, what will happen to me now? Tell me, how long will I live? Let me know how short my life really is.",
  "5": "You gave me only a short life. Compared to you, my whole life is nothing. The life of every human is like a cloud that quickly disappears. Selah",
  "6": "Our life is like an image in a mirror. We rush through life collecting things, but we don't know who will get them after we die.",
  "7": "So, Lord, what hope do I have? You are my hope!",
  "8": "Save me from the bad things I did. Don't let me be treated like a fool.",
  "9": "I will not open my mouth. I will not say anything. You did what should have been done.",
  "10": "But please stop punishing me. You will destroy me if you do not stop.",
  "11": "You punish people for doing wrong to teach them the right way to live. As a moth destroys cloth, you destroy what people love. Yes, our lives are like a small cloud that quickly disappears. Selah",
  "12": "Lord, hear my prayer! Listen to the words I cry to you. Look at my tears. I am only a traveler passing through this life with you. Like all my ancestors, I will live here only a short time.",
  "13": "Leave me alone and let me be happy before I am dead and gone."
