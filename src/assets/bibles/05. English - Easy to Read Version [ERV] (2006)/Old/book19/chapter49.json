  "1": "To the director: A song from the Korah family. Listen to this, all you nations. Pay attention, all you people on earth.",
  "2": "Everyone, rich and poor, listen to me.",
  "3": "I have some very wise words for you. My thoughts will give you understanding.",
  "4": "I listened to these sayings. And now, with my harp, I will sing and make the hidden meaning clear.",
  "5": "Why should I be afraid when trouble comes? There is no need to fear when evil enemies surround me.",
  "6": "They think their wealth will protect them. They brag about how rich they are.",
  "7": "But no one has enough to buy back a life, and you cannot bribe God.",
  "8": "You will never get enough money to pay for your own life.",
  "9": "You will never have enough to buy the right to live forever and keep your body out of the grave.",
  "10": "Look, the wise die the same as fools and stupid people. They die and leave their wealth to others.",
  "11": "The grave will be their new home forever. And how much land they owned will not make any difference.",
  "12": "People might be wealthy, but they cannot stay here forever. They will die like the animals.",
  "13": "That is what happens to all who trust in themselves and to anyone who accepts their way of life. Selah",
  "14": "They are just like sheep, but the grave will be their pen. Death will be their shepherd. When morning comes, the good people will enjoy victory, as the bodies of the proud slowly rot in the grave, far away from their fancy houses.",
  "15": "But God will pay the price to save me from the grave. He will take me to be with him. Selah",
  "16": "Don't be afraid of people just because they are rich. Don't be afraid of people just because they have big, fancy houses.",
  "17": "They will not take anything with them when they die. They will not take their wealth with them.",
  "18": "A wealthy man might tell himself how well he has done in life. And other people might praise him.",
  "19": "But the time will come for him to die and go to his ancestors. And he will never again see the light of day.",
  "20": "Wealthy people don't seem to understand that they will die like the animals."
