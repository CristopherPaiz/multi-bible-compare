  "1": "My soul, praise the Lord! Lord my God, you are very great! You are clothed with glory and honor.",
  "2": "You wear light like a robe. You spread out the skies like a curtain.",
  "3": "You built your home above them. You use the thick clouds like a chariot and ride across the sky on the wings of the wind.",
  "4": "You make the winds your messengers and flames of fire your servants.",
  "5": "You built the earth on its foundations, so it can never be moved.",
  "6": "You covered it with water like a blanket. The water covered even the mountains.",
  "7": "But you gave the command, and the water turned back. You shouted at the water, and it rushed away.",
  "8": "The water flowed down from the mountains into the valleys, to the places you made for it.",
  "9": "You set the limits for the seas, and the water will never again rise to cover the earth.",
  "10": "Lord, you cause water to flow from springs into the streams that flow down between the mountains.",
  "11": "The streams provide water for all the wild animals. Even the wild donkeys come there to drink.",
  "12": "Wild birds come to live by the pools; they sing in the branches of nearby trees.",
  "13": "You send rain down on the mountains. The earth gets everything it needs from what you have made.",
  "14": "You make the grass grow to feed the animals. You provide plants for the crops we grow—the plants that give us food from the earth.",
  "15": "You give us the wine that makes us happy, the oil that makes our skin soft, and the food that makes us strong.",
  "16": "The great cedar trees of Lebanon belong to the Lord. He planted them and gives them the water they need.",
  "17": "That's where the birds make their nests, and the storks live in the fir trees.",
  "18": "The high mountains are a home for wild goats. The large rocks are hiding places for rock badgers.",
  "19": "Lord, you made the moon to show us when the festivals begin. And the sun always knows when to set.",
  "20": "You made darkness to be the night— the time when wild animals come out and roam around.",
  "21": "Lions roar as they attack, as if they are asking God for the food he gives them.",
  "22": "When the sun rises, they leave and go back to their dens to rest.",
  "23": "Then people go out to do their work, and they work until evening.",
  "24": "Lord, you created so many things! With your wisdom you made them all. The earth is full of the living things you made.",
  "25": "Look at the ocean, so big and wide! It is filled with all kinds of sea life. There are creatures large and small— too many to count!",
  "26": "Ships sail over the ocean, and playing there is Leviathan, the great sea creature you made.",
  "27": "Lord, all living things depend on you. You give them food at the right time.",
  "28": "You give it, and they eat it. They are filled with good food from your open hands.",
  "29": "When you turn away from them, they become frightened. When you take away their breath, they die, and their bodies return to the dust.",
  "30": "But when you send out your lifegiving breath, things come alive, and the world is like new again!",
  "31": "May the Lord's glory continue forever! May the Lord enjoy what he made.",
  "32": "He just looks at the earth, and it trembles. He just touches the mountains, and smoke rises from them.",
  "33": "I will sing to the Lord for the rest of my life. I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.",
  "34": "May my words be pleasing to him. The Lord is the one who makes me happy.",
  "35": "I wish sinners would disappear from the earth. I wish the wicked would be gone forever. My soul, praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!"
