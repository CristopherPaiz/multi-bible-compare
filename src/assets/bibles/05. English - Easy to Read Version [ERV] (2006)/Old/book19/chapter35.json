  "3": "Take a spear and javelin and fight those who are chasing me. Tell me, \"I will rescue you.\"",
  "4": "Some people are trying to kill me. Disappoint them and make them ashamed. Make them turn and run away. They are planning to hurt me. Defeat and embarrass them.",
  "5": "Make them like chaff blown by the wind. Let them be chased by the Lord's angel.",
  "6": "Make their road dark and slippery. Let the Lord's angel chase them.",
  "7": "I did nothing wrong, but they tried to trap me. For no reason at all, they dug a pit to catch me.",
  "8": "So let them fall into their own traps. Let them stumble into their own nets. Let some unknown danger catch them.",
  "9": "Then I will rejoice in the Lord. I will be happy when he saves me.",
  "10": "With my whole self I will say, \"Lord, there is no one like you. You protect the poor from those who are stronger. You save the poor and helpless from those who try to rob them.\"",

  "22": "Lord, surely you can see what is happening. So don't keep quiet. Lord, don't leave me.",
  "23": "Wake up! Get up! My God and my Lord, fight for me, and bring me justice.",
  "24": "Lord my God, judge me with your fairness. Don't let those people laugh at me.",
  "25": "Don't let them think, \"Aha! We got what we wanted!\" Don't let them say, \"We destroyed him!\"",
  "26": "Let my enemies be ashamed and embarrassedâ€” all those who were happy about my troubles. Proud of themselves, they treated me as worthless. So let them be covered with shame and disgrace.",
