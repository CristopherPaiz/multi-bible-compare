  "1": "A song from the Korah family. To the director: About a painful sickness. A maskil from Heman the Ezrahite. Lord God, you are my Savior. I have been praying to you day and night.",
  "2": "Please pay attention to my prayers. Listen to my prayers for mercy.",
  "3": "My soul has had enough of this pain! I am ready to die.",
  "4": "People already treat me like a dead man, like someone too weak to live.",
  "5": "Look for me among the dead, like a body in the grave. I am one of those you have forgotten, cut off from you and your care.",
  "6": "You put me in that hole in the ground. Yes, you put me in that dark place.",
  "7": "Your anger presses down on me like a heavy weight. It's like one wave after another pounding against me. Selah",
  "8": "You made my friends leave me. They all avoid me like someone no one wants to touch. Like a prisoner in my house, I cannot go out.",
  "9": "My eyes hurt from crying. Lord, I pray to you constantly! I lift my arms in prayer to you.",
  "10": "Do you do miracles for the dead? Do ghosts rise up and praise you? No! Selah",
  "11": "The dead in their graves cannot talk about your faithful love. People in the world of the dead cannot talk about your faithfulness.",
  "12": "The dead who lie in darkness cannot see the amazing things you do. Those in the world of the forgotten cannot talk about your goodness.",
  "13": "Lord, I am asking you to help me! Early each morning I pray to you.",
  "14": "Lord, why have you abandoned me? Why do you refuse to listen to me?",
  "15": "I have been sick and weak since I was young. I have suffered your anger, and I am helpless.",
  "16": "Your anger covers me like a flood. Your attacks are killing me.",
  "17": "They surround me on every side. I feel like a drowning man.",
  "18": "You caused my friends and loved ones to leave me. Now darkness is my closest friend."
