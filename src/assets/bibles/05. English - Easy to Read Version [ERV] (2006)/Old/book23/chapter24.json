Buyers and sellers will be the same. Those who borrow and those who lend will be the same. Bankers and those who owe the bank will be the same.",
  "3": "Everyone will be forced out of the land. All the wealth will be taken. This will happen because the Lord commanded it.",
  "4": "The country will be empty and sad. The world will be empty and weak. The great leaders of the people in this land will become weak.",
  "5": "The people have ruined the land. They did what God said was wrong. They did not obey God's laws. They made an agreement with God a long time ago, but they broke their agreement with God.",

  "12": "All that is left is destruction. Even the gates are crushed.",
  "13": "At harvest time, people knock olives from the trees. But a few olives are left in the trees. It will be like that in this land and among the nations.",

  "19": "There will be earthquakes, and the earth will split open.",
  "20": "The sins of the world are very heavy, so the earth will fall under the weight. It will shake like an old house. It will fall like a drunk. It will not be able to stand.",
  "21": "At that time the Lord will judge the heavenly armies in heaven and the earthly kings on earth.",
