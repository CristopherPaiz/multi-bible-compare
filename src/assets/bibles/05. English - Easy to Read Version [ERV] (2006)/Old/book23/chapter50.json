  "1": "This is what the Lord says: \"People of Israel, you say that I divorced your mother, Jerusalem. But where is the legal paper that proves I divorced her? My children, did I owe money to someone? Did I sell you to pay a debt? No, you were sold because of the bad things you did. Your mother was sent away because of the bad things you did.",
  "2": "I came home and found no one there. I called and called, but no one answered. Do you think I cannot get you back? Do you think I cannot save you? Look, if I gave the command, the ocean would dry up! I can turn rivers into a desert. The fish would die without water, and their bodies would rot.",

  "6": "I will let those people beat me and pull the hair from my beard. I will not hide my face when they say bad things to me and spit at me.",
  "7": "The Lord God will help me, so the bad things they say will not hurt me. I will be strong. I know I will not be disappointed.",
  "8": "The Lord is with me. He shows that I am innocent, so no one will be able to show I am guilty. If someone wants to try to prove I am wrong, that person should come to me, and we will have a trial.",
  "9": "But look, the Lord God helps me, so no one can prove me guilty. As for them, they will all be like worthless old clothes, eaten by moths.",
  "10": "People who respect the Lord also listen to his servant. That servant lives completely trusting in God without knowing what will happen. He really trusts in the Lord's name and depends on his God.",
  "11": "The Lord says, \"Look, you people want to do whatever you want. So light your own fires and torches, but you will be punished. You will fall into your fires and torches and be burned. I will make that happen.\""
