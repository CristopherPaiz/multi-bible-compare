  "3": "Then I went to the woman prophet. She became pregnant and had a son. The Lord told me, \"Name the boy Maher Shalal Hash Baz.\"",
  "4": "He said that because before the boy learns to say \"Mama\" and \"Daddy,\" God will take all the wealth and riches from Damascus and Samaria and give them to the king of Assyria.",
  "5": "The Lord spoke to me again.",
  "6": "He said, \"These people refuse to accept the slowmoving waters of Shiloah. They prefer Rezin and Remaliah's son.\"",

  "9": "All you nations, prepare for war. You will be defeated. Listen, all you faraway countries! Prepare for battle. You will be defeated.",
  "10": "Make your plans for the fight. Your plans will be defeated. Give orders to your armies, but your orders will be useless, because God is with us!",

  "12": "\"Don't think there is a plan against you just because the people say there is. Don't be afraid of what they fear. Don't let them frighten you!\"",

  "14": "If you people would respect the Lord, he would be a safe place for you. But you don't respect him, so he is like a stone that you stumble over. He is a rock that makes the two families of Israel fall. The Lord has become a trap to all the people of Jerusalem.",
  "15": "(Many people will trip over this rock. They will fall and be broken. They will be caught in the trap.)",
