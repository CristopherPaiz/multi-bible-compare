  "5": "And you are not really his children. Your sins would make him dirty. You are crooked liars.",
  "6": "Is this the way you repay the Lord for all he has done for you? You are stupid, foolish people. He is your Father and your Creator. He made you and he supports you.",
  "7": "\"Remember the days of the past. Think about what happened so long ago. Ask your father; he will tell you. Ask your leaders; they will tell you.",

  "11": "like an eagle when she makes her young leave the nest to fly. She stays close to them, ready to help. She spreads her wings to catch them when they fall and carries them to a safe place.",
  "12": "\"The Lord alone led his people. They had no help from any foreign god.",
  "13": "The Lord helped them take control of the hill country. They took the harvest in the fields. He gave them honey from the cliffs and olive oil from the rocky ground.",
  "14": "He gave his people butter from the herd and milk from the flock. He gave them lambs and goats. They had the best rams from Bashan, and the finest wheat. They drank the best wine, made from the juice of red grapes.",
  "15": "\"But Jeshurun became fat and kicked like a bull. (Yes, you people were fed well and became full and fat.) They left the God who made them! They ran away from the Rock who saved them.",

  "19": "\"The Lord saw this and became upset. His sons and daughters made him angry!",
  "20": "So he said, 'I will turn away from them, then let's see what happens! They are a rebellious people. They are like children who will not learn their lessons.",
  "21": "They made me jealous with demons that aren't gods. They made me angry with these worthless idols. So I will use people who are not a real nation to make them jealous. I will use a foolish nation to make them angry.",

  "30": "Can one person chase away 1000 men? Can two men cause 10,000 men to run away? This will happen only if the Lord gives them to their enemy. This will happen only if their Rock sells them like slaves.",

  "37": "Then the Lord will say, 'Where are the false gods? Where is the \"rock\" that you ran to for protection?",
  "38": "Those false gods ate the fat of your sacrifices. And they drank the wine of your offerings. So let them get up and help you! Let them protect you!",
