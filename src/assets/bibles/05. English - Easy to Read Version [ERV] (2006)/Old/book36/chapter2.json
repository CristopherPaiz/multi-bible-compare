  "9": "So, as surely as I am alive, Moab and the people of Ammon will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah. I am the Lord All- Powerful, the God of Israel, and I promise those countries will be destroyed completely forever. Their land will be overgrown with weeds.

It will be an empty place where only wild animals go to rest. People who pass by will whistle and shake their heads when they see how badly the city was destroyed."
