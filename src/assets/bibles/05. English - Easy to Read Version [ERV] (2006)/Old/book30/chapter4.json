  "1": "Listen to me, you cows of Bashan on Samaria's mountain. You hurt the poor and crush those in need. You tell your husbands, \"Bring us something to drink!\"",
  "2": "The Lord God made a promise. He promised by his holiness, that troubles will come to you. People will use hooks and take you away as prisoners. They will use fishhooks to take away your children.",
  "3": "Your city will be destroyed. The women will rush out through cracks in the wall and throw themselves onto the pile of dead bodies. This is what the Lord says:",
  "4": "\"Go to Bethel and sin. Go to Gilgal and sin even more. Offer your sacrifices in the morning. Bring a tenth of your crops for the threeday festival.",
  "5": "And offer a thank offering made with yeast. Tell everyone about the freewill offerings. Israel, you love to do those things. So go and do them.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "6": "\"I didn't give you any food to eat. There was no food in any of your cities, but you didn't come back to me.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "7": "\"I also stopped the rain, and it was three months before harvest time. So no crops grew. Then I let it rain on one city, but not on another city. Rain fell on one part of the country, but on the other part of the country, the land became very dry.",
  "8": "So the people from two or three cities staggered to another city to get water, but there was not enough water for everyone. Still you didn't come to me for help.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "9": "\"I made your crops die from heat and disease. I destroyed your gardens and your vineyards. Locusts ate your fig trees and olive trees. But you still didn't come to me for help.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "10": "\"I sent diseases against you, as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with swords. I took away your horses. I made your camp smell very bad from all the dead bodies, but still you didn't come back to me for help.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "11": "\"I destroyed you as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. And those cities were completely destroyed. You were like a burned stick pulled from a fire, but still you didn't come back to me for help.\" This is what the Lord said.",
  "12": "\"So this is what I will do to you, Israel. Prepare to meet your God, Israel.",
  "13": "I am the one who made the mountains. I created your minds. I taught people how to speak. I change the darkness into dawn. I walk over the mountains of the earth.\" His name is Yahweh, God of the armies."
