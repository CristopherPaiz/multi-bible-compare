  "5": "You play your harps, and like David, you practice on your musical instruments.",
  "6": "You drink wine in fancy cups. You use the best perfumes. And it doesn't even bother you that Joseph's family is being destroyed.",

We must not mention the name of the Lord.\"",
  "11": "Look, the Lord God will give the command, and the large houses will be broken to pieces, and the small houses will be broken to small pieces.",
  "12": "Do horses run over loose rocks? No, and people don't use cows for plowing. But you turned everything upside down. You changed justice and goodness to bitter poison.",
  "13": "You are happy in Lo-Debar. You say, \"We have taken Karnaim by our own strength.\"",
  "14": "\"But Israel, I will bring a nation against you that will bring troubles to your whole country from Lebo-Hamath to Arabah Brook.\" This is what the Lord God All- Powerful said."
