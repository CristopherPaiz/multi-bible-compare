  "17": "He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.",
  "18": "For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.",
  "19": "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,",

  "21": "In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.",
  "22": "And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit."
