  "1": "Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children",
  "2": "and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.",
  "3": "But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.",
  "4": "Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.",
  "5": "For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.",
  "7": "Therefore do not be partners with them.",
  "8": "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light",
  "9": "(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)",
  "10": "and find out what pleases the Lord.",
  "11": "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.",
  "12": "For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.",
  "13": "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,",
  "14": "for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\"",
  "15": "Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,",
  "16": "making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.",
  "17": "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.",
  "18": "Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.",
  "19": "Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,",
  "20": "always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "21": "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.",
  "23": "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.",
  "24": "Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her",
  "26": "to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,",
  "27": "and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.",
  "28": "In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
  "29": "After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--",
  "30": "for we are members of his body.",
  "31": "\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"",
  "32": "This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.",
  "33": "However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
