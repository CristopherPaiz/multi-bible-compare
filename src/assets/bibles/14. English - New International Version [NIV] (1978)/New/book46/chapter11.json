  "1": "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.",
  "2": "I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you.",
  "3": "Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.",
  "4": "Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.",
  "5": "And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved.",
  "6": "If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.",
  "7": "A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.",
  "8": "For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;",
  "9": "neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.",
  "10": "For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.",
  "11": "In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.",
  "12": "For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.",
  "13": "Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?",
  "14": "Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,",
  "15": "but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.",
  "16": "If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God.",
  "17": "In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.",
  "18": "In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.",
  "19": "No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.",
  "20": "When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,",
  "21": "for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.",
  "22": "Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!",
  "23": "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,",
  "24": "and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\"",
  "25": "In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"",
  "26": "For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.",
  "27": "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.",
  "29": "For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.",
  "30": "That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.",
  "31": "But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.",
  "32": "When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.",
  "33": "So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.",
  "34": "If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions."
