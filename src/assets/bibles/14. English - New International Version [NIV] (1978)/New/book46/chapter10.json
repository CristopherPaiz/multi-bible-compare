  "6": "Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.",
  "7": "Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.\"",
  "8": "We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.",

  "14": "Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.",
  "15": "I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.",
  "16": "Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?",
  "17": "Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.",
  "18": "Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?",
  "19": "Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
  "20": "No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.",
