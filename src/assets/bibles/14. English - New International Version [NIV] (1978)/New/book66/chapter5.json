  "13": "Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: \"To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!\"",
  "14": "The four living creatures said, \"Amen,\" and the elders fell down and worshiped."
