  "1": "The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and",
  "2": "saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed.",
  "3": "(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.",
  "4": "When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )",
  "5": "So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\"",
  "6": "He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.",
  "7": "They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'",
  "8": "You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\"",
  "9": "And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!",
  "10": "For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'",
  "11": "But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),",
  "12": "then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.",
  "13": "Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\"",
  "14": "Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.",
  "15": "Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\"",
  "16": "See Footnote",
  "17": "After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.",
  "18": "\"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?",
  "19": "For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\")",
  "20": "He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'",
  "21": "For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,",
  "22": "greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.",
  "23": "All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\"",
  "24": "Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.",
  "25": "In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.",
  "26": "The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.",
  "27": "\"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\"",
  "28": "\"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\"",
  "29": "Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\"",

  "31": "Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.",
  "32": "There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.",
  "33": "After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.",
  "34": "He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ).",
  "35": "At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.",
  "36": "Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.",
  "37": "People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\""
