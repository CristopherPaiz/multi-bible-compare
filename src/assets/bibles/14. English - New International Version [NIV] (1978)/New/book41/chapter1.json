  "1": "The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
  "2": "It is written in Isaiah the prophet: \"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way\"--",
  "3": "\"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\"",
  "4": "And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
  "5": "The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.",
  "6": "John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
  "7": "And this was his message: \"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.",
  "8": "I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"",
  "9": "At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
  "10": "As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
  "11": "And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\"",
  "12": "At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,",
  "13": "and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.",
  "14": "After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.",
  "15": "\"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\"",
  "16": "As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.",
  "17": "\"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\"",
  "18": "At once they left their nets and followed him.",
  "19": "When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.",
  "20": "Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
  "21": "They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
  "22": "The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.",
  "23": "Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,",
  "24": "\"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\"",
  "25": "\"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\"",
  "26": "The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.",
  "27": "The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\"",
  "28": "News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.",
  "29": "As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.",
  "30": "Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.",
  "31": "So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.",
  "32": "That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.",
  "33": "The whole town gathered at the door,",
  "34": "and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.",
  "35": "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.",
  "36": "Simon and his companions went to look for him,",
  "37": "and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\"",
  "38": "Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\"",
  "39": "So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.",
  "40": "A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\"",
  "41": "Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\"",
  "42": "Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.",
  "43": "Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:",
  "44": "\"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\"",
  "45": "Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere."
