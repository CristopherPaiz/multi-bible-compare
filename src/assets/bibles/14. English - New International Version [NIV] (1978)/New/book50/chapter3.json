  "1": "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.",
  "2": "Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.",
  "3": "For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--",
  "4": "though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:",
  "5": "circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;",
  "6": "as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.",
  "7": "But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.",
  "8": "What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ",
  "9": "and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.",
  "10": "I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,",
  "11": "and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.",

  "14": "I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.",
  "15": "All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.",
  "16": "Only let us live up to what we have already attained.",
  "17": "Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.",
  "18": "For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.",
  "19": "Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.",
  "20": "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "21": "who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."
