  "1": "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:",
  "2": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "3": "I thank my God every time I remember you.",
  "4": "In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy",
  "5": "because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,",
  "6": "being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.",
  "7": "It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.",
  "8": "God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.",
  "9": "And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,",
  "10": "so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,",
  "11": "filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.",
  "12": "Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.",
  "13": "As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.",
  "14": "Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.",
  "15": "It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.",
  "16": "The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.",
  "17": "The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.",
  "18": "But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.",
  "19": "Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.",
  "20": "I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.",
  "21": "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.",
  "22": "If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!",
  "23": "I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;",
  "24": "but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.",
  "25": "Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,",
  "26": "so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.",
  "27": "Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel",
  "28": "without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.",
  "29": "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,",
  "30": "since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have."
