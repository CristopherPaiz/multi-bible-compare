  "7": "They discussed this among themselves and said, \"It is because we didn't bring any bread.\"",
  "8": "Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, \"You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?",
  "9": "Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?",
  "10": "Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?",
  "11": "How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\"",
  "12": "Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
  "13": "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\"",
