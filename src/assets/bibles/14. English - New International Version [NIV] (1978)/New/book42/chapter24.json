  "1": "On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.",
  "2": "They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,",
  "3": "but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
  "4": "While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.",
  "5": "In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead?",
  "6": "He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:",
  "7": "'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\"",
  "8": "Then they remembered his words.",
  "9": "When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.",
  "10": "It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.",
  "11": "But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.",
  "12": "Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.",
  "13": "Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.",
  "14": "They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.",
  "15": "As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;",
  "16": "but they were kept from recognizing him.",
  "17": "He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\"",
  "18": "They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\"",
  "19": "\"What things?\" he asked.",
  "20": "\"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;",
  "21": "but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.",
  "22": "In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning",
  "23": "but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.",
  "24": "Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\"",
  "25": "He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "26": "Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\"",
  "27": "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.",
  "28": "As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.",
  "29": "But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them.",
  "30": "When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.",
  "31": "Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.",
  "32": "They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\"",
  "33": "They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together",
  "34": "and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\"",
  "35": "Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.",
  "36": "While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\"",
  "37": "They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.",
  "38": "He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?",
  "39": "Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\"",
  "40": "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.",
  "41": "And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\"",
  "42": "They gave him a piece of broiled fish,",
  "43": "and he took it and ate it in their presence.",
  "44": "He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\"",
  "45": "Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.",
  "46": "He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,",
  "47": "and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.",
  "48": "You are witnesses of these things.",
  "49": "I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\"",
  "50": "When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.",
  "51": "While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.",
  "52": "Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.",
  "53": "And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God."
