  "15": "And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths.",
  "16": "\"He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\"",
  "17": "The seventy-two returned with joy and said, \"Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.\"",
  "18": "He replied, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.",
  "19": "I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.",
  "20": "However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\"",
  "21": "At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.",

  "25": "On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\"",
  "26": "\"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\"",
  "27": "He answered: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\"",
  "28": "\"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\"",
