  "1": "Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.",
  "2": "Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.",
  "3": "Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.",
  "4": "See Footnote",
  "5": "One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.",
  "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\"",
  "7": "\"Sir,\" the invalid replied, \"I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\"",
  "8": "Then Jesus said to him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\"",
  "9": "At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,",
  "10": "and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\"",
  "11": "But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\"",
  "12": "So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\"",
  "13": "The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.",
  "14": "Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\"",
  "15": "The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
  "16": "So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.",
  "17": "Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\"",
  "18": "For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
  "19": "Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.",
  "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.",
  "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.",
  "22": "Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,",
  "23": "that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.",
  "24": "\"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.",
  "25": "I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.",
  "26": "For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.",
  "27": "And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.",
  "28": "\"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice",
  "29": "and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.",
  "30": "By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.",
  "31": "\"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.",
  "32": "There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.",
  "33": "\"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.",
  "34": "Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.",
  "35": "John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.",
  "36": "\"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.",
  "37": "And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,",
  "38": "nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.",
  "39": "You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,",
  "40": "yet you refuse to come to me to have life.",
  "41": "\"I do not accept praise from men,",
  "42": "but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.",
  "43": "I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.",
  "44": "How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?",
  "45": "\"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.",
  "46": "If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.",
  "47": "But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?\""
