  "1": "I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "2": "God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:",
  "3": "\"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me\"?",
  "4": "And what was God's answer to him? \"I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\"",
  "5": "So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.",
  "6": "And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.",
  "7": "What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,",
  "8": "as it is written: \"God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day.\"",
  "9": "And David says: \"May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.",
  "10": "May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.\"",
  "11": "Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.",
  "12": "But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!",
  "13": "I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry",
  "14": "in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.",
  "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?",
  "16": "If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.",
  "17": "If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,",
  "18": "do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.",
  "19": "You will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\"",
  "20": "Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.",
  "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.",
  "22": "Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.",
  "23": "And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",
  "24": "After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!",
  "25": "I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.",
  "26": "And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.",
  "27": "And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\"",
  "28": "As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,",
  "29": "for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.",
  "30": "Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,",
  "31": "so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.",
  "32": "For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.",
  "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!",
  "34": "\"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\"",
  "35": "\"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\"",
  "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen."
