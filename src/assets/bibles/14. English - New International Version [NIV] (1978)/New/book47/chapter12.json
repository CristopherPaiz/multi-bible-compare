  "1": "I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.",
  "2": "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God knows.",
  "3": "And I know that this man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows--",
  "4": "was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.",
  "5": "I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.",
  "6": "Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.",
  "7": "To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.",
  "8": "Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.",
  "9": "But he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.",
  "10": "That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
  "11": "I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the \"super-apostles,\" even though I am nothing.",
  "12": "The things that mark an apostle--signs, wonders and miracles--were done among you with great perseverance.",
  "13": "How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!",
  "14": "Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.",
  "15": "So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?",
  "16": "Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!",
  "17": "Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you?",
  "18": "I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course?",
  "19": "Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.",
  "20": "For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.",
  "21": "I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged."
