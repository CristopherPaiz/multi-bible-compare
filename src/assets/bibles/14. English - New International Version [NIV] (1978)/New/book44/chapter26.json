  "1": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, \"You have permission to speak for yourself.\" So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:",
  "2": "\"King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,",
  "3": "and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.",
  "4": "\"The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.",
  "5": "They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.",
  "6": "And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.",
  "7": "This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.",
  "8": "Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?",
  "9": "\"I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",
  "10": "And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.",
  "11": "Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.",
  "12": "\"On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.",
  "13": "About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.",
  "14": "We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'",
  "15": "\"Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?'",
  "16": "\"'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied. 'Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.",
  "17": "I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them",
  "18": "to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'",
  "19": "\"So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.",
  "20": "First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.",
  "21": "That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.",
  "22": "But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--",
  "23": "that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles.\"",
  "24": "At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. \"You are out of your mind, Paul!\" he shouted. \"Your great learning is driving you insane.\"",
  "25": "\"I am not insane, most excellent Festus,\" Paul replied. \"What I am saying is true and reasonable.",
  "26": "The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.",
  "27": "King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.\"",
  "28": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, \"Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?\"",
  "29": "Paul replied, \"Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.\"",
  "30": "The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.",
  "31": "They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, \"This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.\"",
  "32": "Agrippa said to Festus, \"This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.\""
