  "1": "Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.",
  "2": "When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: \"We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.",
  "3": "Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.",
  "4": "But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.",
  "5": "\"We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect",
  "6": "and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.",
  "7": "See Footnote",
  "8": "By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.\"",
  "9": "The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.",
  "10": "When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: \"I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.",
  "11": "You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.",
  "12": "My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.",
  "13": "And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.",
  "14": "However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,",
  "15": "and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.",
  "16": "So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.",
  "17": "\"After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.",
  "18": "I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.",
  "19": "But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.",
  "20": "Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--",
  "21": "unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'\"",
  "22": "Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. \"When Lysias the commander comes,\" he said, \"I will decide your case.\"",
  "23": "He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.",
  "24": "Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.",
  "25": "As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, \"That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.\"",
  "26": "At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.",
  "27": "When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison."
