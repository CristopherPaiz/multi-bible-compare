  "4": "Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face and then goes to a prophet, I the LORD will answer him myself in keeping with his great idolatry.",
  "5": "I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.'",
