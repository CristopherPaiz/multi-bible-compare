  "3": "Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.",
  "4": "\"Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.",
  "5": "I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel.",
  "6": "\"After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.",

  "14": "Then I said, \"Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.\"",
  "15": "\"Very well,\" he said, \"I will let you bake your bread over cow manure instead of human excrement.\"",
  "16": "He then said to me: \"Son of man, I will cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair,",
  "17": "for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin."
