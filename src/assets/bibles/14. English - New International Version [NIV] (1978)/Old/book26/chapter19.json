  "1": "\"Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel",
  "2": "and say: \"'What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.",
  "3": "She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.",
  "4": "The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt.",
  "5": "\"'When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.",
  "6": "He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.",
  "7": "He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.",
  "8": "Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit.",
  "9": "With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.",
  "10": "\"'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.",
  "11": "Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.",
  "12": "But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.",
  "13": "Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.",
  "14": "Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's scepter.' This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.\""
