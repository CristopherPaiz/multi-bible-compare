  "3": "Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?",
  "4": "And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?",
  "5": "If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?",
  "6": "\"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.",
  "7": "I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD.",
  "8": "I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD.\""
