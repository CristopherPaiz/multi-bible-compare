  "3": "and say to her: 'This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.",
  "4": "Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.",
  "5": "Then all people will know that I the LORD have drawn my sword from its scabbard; it will not return again.'",
  "6": "\"Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter grief.",
  "7": "And when they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt and every hand go limp; every spirit will become faint and every knee become as weak as water.' It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD.\"",

  "13": "\"'Testing will surely come. And what if the scepter of Judah, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Sovereign LORD.'",
  "14": "\"So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is a sword for slaughter- a sword for great slaughter, closing in on them from every side.",
  "15": "So that hearts may melt and the fallen be many, I have stationed the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Oh! It is made to flash like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter.",

  "20": "Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.",
  "21": "For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will consult his idols, he will examine the liver.",
  "22": "Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to give the command to slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp and to erect siege works.",
