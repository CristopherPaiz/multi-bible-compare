  "6": "But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.'",
  "7": "\"My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "8": "But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart.",
  "9": "Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood-he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'",
  "10": "\"The LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",

  "31": "so that they will fear you and walk in your ways all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers.",
  "32": "\"As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm-when he comes and prays toward this temple,",
