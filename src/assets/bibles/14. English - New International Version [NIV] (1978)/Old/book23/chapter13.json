  "1": "An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:",
  "2": "Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.",
  "3": "I have commanded my holy ones; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath- those who rejoice in my triumph.",
  "4": "Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war.",
  "5": "They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens- the LORD and the weapons of his wrath- to destroy the whole country.",
  "6": "Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.",
  "7": "Because of this, all hands will go limp, every man's heart will melt.",
  "8": "Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.",
  "9": "See, the day of the LORD is coming -a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.",
  "10": "The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.",
  "11": "I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.",
  "12": "I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir.",
  "13": "Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger.",
  "14": "Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.",
  "15": "Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword.",
  "16": "Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished.",
  "17": "See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.",
  "18": "Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children.",
  "19": "Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.",
  "20": "She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there.",
  "21": "But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about.",
  "22": "Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged."
