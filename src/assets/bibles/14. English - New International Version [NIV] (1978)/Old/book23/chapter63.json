  "1": "Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? \"It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.\"",
  "2": "Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress?",
  "3": "\"I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.",
  "4": "For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come.",
  "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.",

  "13": "who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;",
  "14": "like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name.",

  "16": "But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.",
  "17": "Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.",
  "18": "For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.",
  "19": "We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name."
