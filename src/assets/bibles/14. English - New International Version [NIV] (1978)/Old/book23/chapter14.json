  "10": "They will all respond, they will say to you, \"You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us.\"",
  "11": "All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.",

  "19": "But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot,",
  "20": "you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again.",
  "21": "Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.",

  "28": "This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died:",
  "29": "Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.",
  "30": "The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors.",
