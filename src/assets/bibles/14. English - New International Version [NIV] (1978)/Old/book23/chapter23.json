  "1": "An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them.",
  "2": "Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.",
  "3": "On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations.",
  "4": "Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: \"I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.\"",
  "5": "When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.",
  "6": "Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.",
  "7": "Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?",
  "8": "Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?",
  "9": "The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.",
  "10": "Till your land as along the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.",
  "11": "The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed.",

  "15": "At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:",
  "16": "\"Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered.\"",
  "17": "At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.",
  "18": "Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes."
