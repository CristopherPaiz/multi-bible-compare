  "1": "See, the LORD is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants-",

  "3": "The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The LORD has spoken this word.",
  "4": "The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the exalted of the earth languish.",
  "5": "The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.",
  "6": "Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.",

  "8": "The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent.",
  "9": "No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.",

  "11": "In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished from the earth.",
  "12": "The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.",
  "13": "So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.",

  "20": "The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls-never to rise again.",
  "21": "In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.",
  "22": "They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days.",
  "23": "The moon will be abashed, the sun ashamed; for the LORD Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, gloriously."
