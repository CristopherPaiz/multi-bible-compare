  "1": "The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
  "2": "Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.",
  "3": "The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\"",
  "4": "Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.",
  "5": "Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.",
  "6": "From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.",
  "7": "Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.",
  "8": "The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.",
  "9": "Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.",
  "10": "Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!",
  "11": "\"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.",
  "12": "When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?",
  "13": "Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.",
  "14": "Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.",
  "15": "When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;",
  "16": "wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,",
  "17": "learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.",
  "18": "\"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.",
  "19": "If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;",
  "20": "but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.",
  "21": "See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers!",
  "22": "Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.",
  "23": "Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.",
  "24": "Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.",
  "25": "I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.",
  "26": "I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\"",
  "27": "Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.",
  "28": "But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.",
  "29": "\"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.",
  "30": "You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.",
  "31": "The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\""
