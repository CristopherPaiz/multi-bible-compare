  "3": "I clothe the sky with darkness and make sackcloth its covering.\"",
  "4": "The Sovereign LORD has given me an instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being taught.",
  "5": "The Sovereign LORD has opened my ears, and I have not been rebellious; I have not drawn back.",

  "10": "Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the word of his servant? Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.",
  "11": "But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand: You will lie down in torment."
