  "8": "Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf.",
  "9": "All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of them foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, \"It is true.\"",
  "10": "\"You are my witnesses,\" declares the LORD, \"and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.",

  "22": "\"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel.",

  "25": "\"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.",
