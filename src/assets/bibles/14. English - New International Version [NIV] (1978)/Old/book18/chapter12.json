  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!",
  "3": "But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?",
  "4": "\"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!",
  "5": "Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.",
  "6": "The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure- those who carry their god in their hands.",
  "7": "\"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;",
  "8": "or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.",
  "9": "Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?",
  "10": "In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.",
  "11": "Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?",
  "12": "Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?",
  "13": "\"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.",
  "14": "What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.",

  "16": "To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.",
  "17": "He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.",
  "18": "He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.",
  "19": "He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.",
  "20": "He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.",
  "21": "He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.",
  "22": "He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.",
  "23": "He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.",
  "24": "He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.",
  "25": "They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards."
