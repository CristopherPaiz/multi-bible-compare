  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:",
  "2": "\"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?",
  "3": "Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?",
  "4": "You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'",
  "5": "Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you",
  "6": "and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.",
  "7": "\"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?",
  "8": "They are higher than the heavens-what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave -what can you know?",
  "9": "Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.",
  "10": "\"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?",
  "11": "Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?",
  "12": "But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.",
  "13": "\"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,",
  "14": "if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,",
  "15": "then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.",
  "16": "You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.",
  "17": "Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.",
  "18": "You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.",
  "19": "You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.",
  "20": "But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp.\""
