  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"How long will you torment me and crush me with words?",
  "3": "Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.",
  "4": "If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.",
  "5": "If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,",
  "6": "then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.",
  "7": "\"Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.",
  "8": "He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.",
  "9": "He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.",
  "10": "He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.",
  "11": "His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.",
  "12": "His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.",
  "13": "\"He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.",

  "22": "Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?",
  "23": "\"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,",
  "24": "that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!",
  "25": "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.",
  "26": "And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;",
  "27": "I myself will see him with my own eyes-I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!",
  "28": "\"If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, '",
  "29": "you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. \""
