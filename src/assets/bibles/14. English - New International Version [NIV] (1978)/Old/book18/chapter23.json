  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.",
  "3": "If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!",
  "4": "I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.",
  "5": "I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.",
  "6": "Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.",
  "7": "There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.",
  "8": "\"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.",
  "9": "When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.",
  "10": "But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.",
  "11": "My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.",
  "12": "I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.",
  "13": "\"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.",
  "14": "He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.",
  "15": "That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.",
  "16": "God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.",
  "17": "Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face."
