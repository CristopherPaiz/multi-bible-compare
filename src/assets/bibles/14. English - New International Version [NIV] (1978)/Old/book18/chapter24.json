  "1": "\"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?",
  "2": "Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.",
  "3": "They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.",
  "4": "They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.",
  "5": "Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.",
  "6": "They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.",
  "7": "Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.",
  "8": "They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.",
  "9": "The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.",
  "10": "Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.",
  "11": "They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.",
  "12": "The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.",

  "23": "He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.",
  "24": "For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.",
  "25": "\"If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?\""
