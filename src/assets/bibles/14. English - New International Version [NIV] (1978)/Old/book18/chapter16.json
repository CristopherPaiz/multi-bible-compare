  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!",
  "3": "Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?",
  "4": "I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.",
  "5": "But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.",
  "6": "\"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.",
  "7": "Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.",
  "8": "You have bound me-and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.",
  "9": "God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.",
  "10": "Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.",

  "12": "All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;",
  "13": "his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.",

  "15": "\"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.",
  "16": "My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;",
  "17": "yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.",
  "18": "\"O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!",
  "19": "Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.",
  "20": "My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;",
  "21": "on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.",
  "22": "\"Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return."
