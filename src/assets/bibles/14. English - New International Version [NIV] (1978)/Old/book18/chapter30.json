  "1": "\"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.",
  "2": "Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?",
  "3": "Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.",
  "4": "In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.",
  "5": "They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.",
  "6": "They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.",
  "7": "They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.",
  "8": "A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.",
  "9": "\"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.",
  "10": "They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.",
  "11": "Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.",
  "12": "On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.",
  "13": "They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me- without anyone's helping them.",
  "14": "They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.",
  "15": "Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.",

  "18": "In his great power God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.",
  "19": "He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.",
  "20": "\"I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.",
  "21": "You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.",
  "22": "You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.",
  "23": "I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.",

  "26": "Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.",
  "27": "The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.",
  "28": "I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.",
  "29": "I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.",
  "30": "My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.",
  "31": "My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing."
