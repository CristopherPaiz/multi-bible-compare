  "1": "Job continued his discourse:",
  "2": "\"How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,",
  "3": "when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!",
  "4": "Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,",
  "5": "when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,",
  "6": "when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.",
  "7": "\"When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,",
  "8": "the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;",
  "9": "the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;",
  "10": "the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.",
  "11": "Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,",
  "12": "because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.",
  "13": "The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.",
  "14": "I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.",
  "15": "I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.",
  "16": "I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.",
  "17": "I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.",
  "18": "\"I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.",
  "19": "My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.",
  "20": "My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'",
  "21": "\"Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.",
  "22": "After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.",
  "23": "They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.",
  "24": "When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.",
  "25": "I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners."
