  "1": "Then Elihu said:",
  "2": "\"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.",
  "3": "For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.",
  "4": "Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.",
  "5": "\"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.",
  "6": "Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'",
  "7": "What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?",
  "8": "He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.",
  "9": "For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'",
  "10": "\"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.",
  "11": "He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.",
  "12": "It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.",
  "13": "Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?",
  "14": "If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,",
  "15": "all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.",
  "16": "\"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.",
  "17": "Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?",
  "18": "Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'",
  "19": "who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?",
  "20": "They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.",
  "21": "\"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.",
  "22": "There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.",
  "23": "God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.",
  "24": "Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.",
  "25": "Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.",
  "26": "He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,",
  "27": "because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.",
  "28": "They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.",
  "29": "But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,",
  "30": "to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.",
  "31": "\"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.",
  "32": "Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'",
  "33": "Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.",
  "34": "\"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,",
  "35": "'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'",
  "36": "Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!",
  "37": "To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.\""
