  "1": "\"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?",
  "2": "Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,",
  "3": "so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.",
  "4": "When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.",
  "5": "My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.",
  "6": "\"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.",
  "7": "Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.",
  "8": "The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.",
  "9": "As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.",
  "10": "He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.",
  "11": "\"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?",
  "13": "When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,",
  "14": "even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,",
  "15": "so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.",
  "16": "I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.",
  "17": "\"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,",
  "18": "that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?",
  "19": "Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?",
  "20": "If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?",
  "21": "Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more.\""
