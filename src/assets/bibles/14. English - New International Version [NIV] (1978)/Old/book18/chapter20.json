  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:",
  "2": "\"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.",
  "3": "I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.",
  "4": "\"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,",
  "5": "that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.",
  "6": "Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,",
  "7": "he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'",
  "8": "Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.",
  "9": "The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.",
  "10": "His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.",
  "11": "The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.",

  "17": "He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.",
  "18": "What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.",

  "20": "\"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.",
  "21": "Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.",
  "22": "In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.",
  "23": "When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.",
  "24": "Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.",
  "25": "He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;",
  "26": "total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.",
  "27": "The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.",
  "28": "A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.",
  "29": "Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God.\""
