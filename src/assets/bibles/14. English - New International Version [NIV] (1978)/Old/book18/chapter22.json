  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:",
  "2": "\"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?",
  "3": "What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?",
  "4": "\"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?",
  "5": "Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?",
  "6": "You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.",
  "7": "You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,",
  "8": "though you were a powerful man, owning land- an honored man, living on it.",
  "9": "And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.",
  "10": "That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,",
  "11": "why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.",
  "12": "\"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!",
  "13": "Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?",
  "14": "Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'",
  "15": "Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?",
  "16": "They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.",
  "17": "They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'",
  "18": "Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.",
  "19": "\"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,",
  "20": "'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'",
  "21": "\"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.",
  "22": "Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent",
  "24": "and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,",
  "25": "then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.",
  "26": "Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.",
  "28": "What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.",
  "29": "When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.",
  "30": "He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.\""
