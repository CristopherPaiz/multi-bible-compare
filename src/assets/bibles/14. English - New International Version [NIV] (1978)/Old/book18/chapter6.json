  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!",
  "3": "It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas- no wonder my words have been impetuous.",
  "4": "The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.",
  "5": "Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?",
  "6": "Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?",
  "7": "I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.",
  "8": "\"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,",
  "9": "that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!",
  "10": "Then I would still have this consolation- my joy in unrelenting pain- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "\"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?",
  "12": "Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?",
  "13": "Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?",
  "14": "\"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow",
  "16": "when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,",
  "17": "but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.",
  "18": "Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.",
  "19": "The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.",
  "20": "They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.",
  "21": "Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.",
  "22": "Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,",
  "23": "deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?",
  "24": "\"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.",
  "25": "How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?",
  "26": "Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?",
  "27": "You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.",
  "28": "\"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?",
  "29": "Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.",
  "30": "Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?"
