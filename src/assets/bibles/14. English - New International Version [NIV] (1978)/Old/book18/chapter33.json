  "1": "\"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.",
  "2": "I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.",
  "3": "My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.",
  "4": "The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.",
  "6": "I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.",
  "7": "No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.",
  "8": "\"But you have said in my hearing- I heard the very words-",
  "9": "'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.",
  "10": "Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.",
  "11": "He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'",
  "12": "\"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.",
  "13": "Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?",
  "14": "For God does speak-now one way, now another- though man may not perceive it.",
  "15": "In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,",
  "16": "he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,",
  "17": "to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,",
  "18": "to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.",
  "19": "Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,",
  "20": "so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.",
  "21": "His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.",
  "22": "His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.",
  "23": "\"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,",
  "24": "to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'-",
  "25": "then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.",
  "26": "He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.",
  "27": "Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.",
  "28": "He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'",
  "29": "\"God does all these things to a man- twice, even three times-",
  "30": "to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.",
  "31": "\"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.",
  "32": "If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.",
  "33": "But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.\""
