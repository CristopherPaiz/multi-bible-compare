  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:",
  "2": "\"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?",
  "3": "Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?",
  "4": "But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.",
  "5": "Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.",
  "6": "Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.",
  "7": "\"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?",
  "10": "The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.",
  "11": "Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?",
  "12": "Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,",
  "13": "so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?",
  "14": "\"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?",
  "15": "If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,",
  "16": "how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!",
  "17": "\"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,",
  "18": "what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers",

  "20": "All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.",
  "21": "Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.",
  "22": "He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.",
  "23": "He wanders about-food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.",
  "24": "Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,",
  "25": "because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,",
  "26": "defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.",
  "27": "\"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,",
  "28": "he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.",
  "29": "He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.",
  "30": "He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.",
  "31": "Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.",
  "32": "Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.",
  "33": "He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.",
  "34": "For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.",
  "35": "They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit.\""
