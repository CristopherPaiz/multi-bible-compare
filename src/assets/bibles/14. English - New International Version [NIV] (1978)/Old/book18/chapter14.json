  "1": "\"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.",
  "2": "He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.",
  "3": "Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?",
  "4": "Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!",
  "5": "Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.",
  "6": "So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.",
  "7": "\"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.",
  "8": "Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,",
  "9": "yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.",
  "10": "But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.",
  "11": "As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,",
  "12": "so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.",
  "13": "\"If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!",
  "14": "If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.",
  "15": "You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.",
  "16": "Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.",
  "17": "My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.",
  "18": "\"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,",
  "19": "as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.",
  "20": "You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.",
  "21": "If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.",
  "22": "He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.\""
