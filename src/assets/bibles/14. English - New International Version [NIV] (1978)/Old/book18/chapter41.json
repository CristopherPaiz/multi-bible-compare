  "1": "\"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?",
  "2": "Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?",
  "3": "Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?",
  "4": "Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?",
  "5": "Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?",
  "6": "Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!",
  "9": "Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.",
  "10": "No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?",
  "11": "Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.",
  "12": "\"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.",
  "13": "Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?",
  "14": "Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?",
  "15": "His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;",
  "16": "each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.",

  "21": "His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.",
  "22": "Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.",
  "23": "The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.",
  "24": "His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.",
  "25": "When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.",
  "26": "The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.",
  "27": "Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.",
  "28": "Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.",
  "29": "A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.",
  "30": "His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.",
  "31": "He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.",
  "32": "Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.",
  "33": "Nothing on earth is his equal- a creature without fear.",
  "34": "He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.\""
