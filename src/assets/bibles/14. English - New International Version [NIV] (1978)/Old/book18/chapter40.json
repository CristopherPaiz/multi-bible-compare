  "1": "The LORD said to Job:",
  "2": "\"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!\"",
  "3": "Then Job answered the LORD:",
  "4": "\"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.",
  "5": "I spoke once, but I have no answer- twice, but I will say no more.\"",
  "6": "Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:",
  "7": "\"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.",
  "8": "\"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?",
  "9": "Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?",
  "10": "Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.",
  "11": "Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,",
  "12": "look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.",
  "13": "Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.",
  "14": "Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.",
  "15": "\"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.",
  "16": "What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!",
  "17": "His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.",
  "18": "His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.",
  "19": "He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.",
  "20": "The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.",
  "21": "Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.",
  "22": "The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.",
  "23": "When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.",
  "24": "Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?"
