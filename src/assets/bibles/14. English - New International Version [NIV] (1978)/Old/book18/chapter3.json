  "1": "After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.",
  "2": "He said:",
  "3": "\"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'",
  "4": "That day-may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.",
  "5": "May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.",
  "6": "That night-may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.",
  "7": "May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.",
  "8": "May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.",
  "9": "May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,",

  "13": "For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest",
  "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,",
  "15": "with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.",
  "16": "Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?",
  "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.",
  "19": "The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.",
  "20": "\"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,",
  "21": "to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,",
  "22": "who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?",
  "23": "Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?",
  "24": "For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.",
  "25": "What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.",
  "26": "I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.\""
