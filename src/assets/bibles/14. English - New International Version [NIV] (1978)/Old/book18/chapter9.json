  "1": "Then Job replied:",
  "2": "\"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?",
  "3": "Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.",
  "4": "His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?",
  "5": "He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.",
  "7": "He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.",
  "8": "He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.",
  "9": "He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.",
  "10": "He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.",
  "11": "When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.",
  "12": "If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'",
  "13": "God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.",
  "14": "\"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?",
  "15": "Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.",
  "16": "Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.",
  "17": "He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.",
  "18": "He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.",
  "19": "If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?",
  "20": "Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.",
  "21": "\"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.",
  "22": "It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'",
  "23": "When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?",
  "25": "\"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.",
  "26": "They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.",
  "27": "If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'",
  "28": "I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.",
  "29": "Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?",
  "30": "Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,",
  "31": "you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.",
  "32": "\"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.",
  "33": "If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,",
  "34": "someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.",
  "35": "Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot."
