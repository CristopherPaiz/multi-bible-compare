  "3": "Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.",
  "4": "\"Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?",
  "5": "Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.",
  "6": "When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.",
  "7": "Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?",
  "8": "They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.",
  "9": "Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.",
  "10": "Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.",
  "11": "They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.",
  "12": "They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.",
  "13": "They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.",
  "14": "Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.",
  "15": "Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'",
  "16": "But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.",
  "17": "\"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?",
  "18": "How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?",

  "24": "his body well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.",
  "25": "Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.",
  "26": "Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.",
  "27": "\"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.",
  "28": "You say, 'Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'",
  "29": "Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts-",
  "30": "that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from the day of wrath?",
  "31": "Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?",
  "32": "He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.",
  "33": "The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes before him.",
  "34": "\"So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!\""
