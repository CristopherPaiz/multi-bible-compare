  "1": "And Job continued his discourse:",
  "2": "\"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,",

  "4": "my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.",
  "5": "I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.",
  "6": "I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.",
  "7": "\"May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!",
  "8": "For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?",

  "20": "Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.",
  "21": "The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.",
  "22": "It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.",
  "23": "It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place."
