  "1": "My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge for another,",
  "2": "if you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth,",
  "3": "then do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your neighbor!",
  "4": "Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.",
  "5": "Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!",
  "7": "It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,",
  "8": "yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.",
  "9": "How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest-",
  "11": "and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.",
  "12": "A scoundrel and villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,",
  "13": "who winks with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,",
  "14": "who plots evil with deceit in his heart- he always stirs up dissension.",
  "15": "Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed-without remedy.",
  "16": "There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:",
  "17": "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,",
  "18": "a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,",
  "19": "a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.",
  "20": "My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.",
  "21": "Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.",
  "22": "When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.",
  "23": "For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,",
  "24": "keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.",
  "25": "Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,",
  "26": "for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.",
  "27": "Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?",
  "28": "Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?",
  "29": "So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.",
  "30": "Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.",
  "31": "Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.",
  "32": "But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.",
  "33": "Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;",
  "34": "for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.",
  "35": "He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is."
