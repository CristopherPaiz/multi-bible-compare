  "1": "My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,",
  "2": "turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,",
  "3": "and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,",
  "4": "and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,",
  "5": "then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.",
  "6": "For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.",
  "7": "He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,",
  "8": "for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.",
  "9": "Then you will understand what is right and just and fair-every good path.",
  "10": "For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.",
  "11": "Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.",
  "12": "Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,",
  "13": "who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,",
  "14": "who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,",
  "15": "whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.",
  "16": "It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,",
  "17": "who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.",
  "18": "For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.",
  "19": "None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.",
  "20": "Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.",
  "21": "For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;",
  "22": "but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it."
