  "1": "My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,",

  "3": "For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;",
  "4": "but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.",
  "6": "She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.",
  "7": "Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.",
  "8": "Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,",

  "10": "lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.",
  "11": "At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.",

  "15": "Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.",

  "18": "May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.",
  "19": "A loving doe, a graceful deer- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.",
  "20": "Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?",
  "21": "For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.",
  "22": "The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.",
  "23": "He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly."
