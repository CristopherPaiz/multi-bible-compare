  "9": "They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.",
  "10": "\"Hear the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.'",

  "18": "\"I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God.",
  "19": "After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'",

  "27": "\"The days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will plant the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the offspring of men and of animals.",

  "30": "Instead, everyone will die for his own sin; whoever eats sour grapes-his own teeth will be set on edge.",
  "31": "\"The time is coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.",
  "32": "It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them, \"declares the LORD.",
