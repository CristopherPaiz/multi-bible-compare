  "11": "Then he is to take off these clothes and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean.",
  "12": "The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add firewood and arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.",

  "14": "\"'These are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron's sons are to bring it before the LORD, in front of the altar.",
