  "3": "Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.",
  "4": "\"But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.",
  "5": "And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man.",
  "6": "\"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.",

  "11": "I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.\"",

  "23": "But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father's nakedness.",
  "24": "When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,",
  "25": "he said, \"Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.\"",
  "26": "He also said, \"Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.",
