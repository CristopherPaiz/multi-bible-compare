  "1": "Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.",

  "5": "From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.",

  "7": "and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, \"Come to bed with me!\"",
  "8": "But he refused. \"With me in charge,\" he told her, \"my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.",
  "9": "No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?\"",

  "17": "Then she told him this story: \"That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.",

  "19": "When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, \"This is how your slave treated me,\" he burned with anger.",
  "20": "Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,",
  "21": "the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.",
  "22": "So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.",
  "23": "The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did."
