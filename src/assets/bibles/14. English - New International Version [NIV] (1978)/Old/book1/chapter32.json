  "1": "Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.",
  "2": "When Jacob saw them, he said, \"This is the camp of God!\" So he named that place Mahanaim.",
  "3": "Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.",
  "4": "He instructed them: \"This is what you are to say to my master Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.",
  "5": "I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'\"",
  "6": "When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, \"We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.\"",
  "7": "In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.",
  "8": "He thought, \"If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.\"",
  "9": "Then Jacob prayed, \"O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'",
  "10": "I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.",
  "11": "Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.",
  "12": "But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'\"",
  "13": "He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:",
  "14": "two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,",
  "15": "thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.",
  "16": "He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, \"Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.\"",
  "17": "He instructed the one in the lead: \"When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'",
  "18": "then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'\"",
  "19": "He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: \"You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.",
  "20": "And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'\" For he thought, \"I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.\"",
  "21": "So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.",
  "22": "That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.",
  "23": "After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.",
  "24": "So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.",
  "25": "When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.",
  "26": "Then the man said, \"Let me go, for it is daybreak.\" But Jacob replied, \"I will not let you go unless you bless me.\"",
  "27": "The man asked him, \"What is your name?Jacob,\" he answered.",
  "28": "Then the man said, \"Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.\"",
  "29": "Jacob said, \"Please tell me your name.\" But he replied, \"Why do you ask my name?\" Then he blessed him there.",
  "30": "So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, \"It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.\"",
  "31": "The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.",
  "32": "Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon."
