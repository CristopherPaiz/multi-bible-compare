  "4": "\"The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend out fifteen hundred feet from the town wall.",
  "5": "Outside the town, measure three thousand feet on the east side, three thousand on the south side, three thousand on the west and three thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns.",
  "6": "\"Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns.",
  "7": "In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands.",
  "8": "The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few.\"",
