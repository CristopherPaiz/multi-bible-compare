  "23": "Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,",
  "24": "and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.",

  "26": "Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,",
  "27": "and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.",

  "32": "If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.\"",
  "33": "So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.",
  "34": "The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.",
  "35": "Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, \"Rise up, O LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you.\"",
  "36": "Whenever it came to rest, he said, \"Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.\""
