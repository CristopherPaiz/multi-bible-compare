  "11": "Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded.\"",
  "12": "Balaam answered Balak, \"Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,",
  "13": "'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD -and I must say only what the LORD says'?",

  "17": "\"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth.",
  "18": "Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.",
  "19": "A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.\"",
  "20": "Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: \"Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last.\"",
  "21": "Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: \"Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;",
  "22": "yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.\"",
