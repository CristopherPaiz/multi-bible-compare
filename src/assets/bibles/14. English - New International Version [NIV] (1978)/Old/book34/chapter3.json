  "1": "Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!",
  "2": "The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots!",
  "3": "Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses-",
  "4": "all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.",
  "5": "\"I am against you,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.",
  "6": "I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.",
  "7": "All who see you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is in ruins-who will mourn for her?' Where can I find anyone to comfort you?\"",
  "8": "Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her? The river was her defense, the waters her wall.",

  "11": "You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.",
  "12": "All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.",

  "14": "Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses! Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork!",
  "15": "There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down and, like grasshoppers, consume you. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!",
  "16": "You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more than the stars of the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.",
  "17": "Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day- but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where.",
  "18": "O king of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.",
  "19": "Nothing can heal your wound; your injury is fatal. Everyone who hears the news about you claps his hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?"
