  "8": "Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, \"What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the third day from now?\"",
  "9": "Isaiah answered, \"This is the LORD's sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?\"",
  "10": "\"It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps,\" said Hezekiah. \"Rather, have it go back ten steps.\"",

  "12": "At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.",
  "13": "Hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his storehouses-the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine oil-his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.",
  "14": "Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, \"What did those men say, and where did they come from?From a distant land,\" Hezekiah replied. \"They came from Babylon.\"",

  "17": "The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.",
  "18": "And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, that will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.\"",
