  "1": "At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.",

  "8": "Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.",
  "9": "Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: \"The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,\" so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.",

  "17": "then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.",
  "18": "Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.",
