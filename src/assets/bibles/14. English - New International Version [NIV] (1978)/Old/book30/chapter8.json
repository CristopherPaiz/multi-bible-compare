  "1": "This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.",
  "2": "\"What do you see, Amos?\" he asked. \"A basket of ripe fruit,\" I answered. Then the LORD said to me, \"The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.",
  "3": "\"In that day,\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \"the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many, many bodies-flung everywhere! Silence!\"",
  "4": "Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,",
  "5": "saying, \"When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?\"- skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,",
  "6": "buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.",
  "7": "The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: \"I will never forget anything they have done.",
  "8": "\"Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.",
  "9": "\"In that day,\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \"I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.",
  "10": "I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.",
  "11": "\"The days are coming,\" declares the Sovereign LORD, \"when I will send a famine through the land- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.",
  "12": "Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.",
  "13": "\"In that day \"the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.",
  "14": "They who swear by the shame of Samaria, or say, 'As surely as your god lives, O Dan,' or, 'As surely as the god of Beersheba lives'- they will fall, never to rise again.\""
