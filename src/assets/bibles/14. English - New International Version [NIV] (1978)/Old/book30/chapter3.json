  "1": "Hear this word the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel-against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:",
  "2": "\"You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins.\"",
  "3": "Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?",
  "4": "Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?",
  "5": "Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?",
  "6": "When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?",
  "7": "Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.",
  "8": "The lion has roared- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken- who can but prophesy?",
  "9": "Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: \"Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.\"",

  "12": "This is what the LORD says: \"As a shepherd saves from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites be saved, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches. \"",
  "13": "\"Hear this and testify against the house of Jacob,\" declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty.",
  "14": "\"On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.",
  "15": "I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished,\" declares the LORD."
