  "1": "Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'\"",
  "2": "Pharaoh said, \"Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.\"",
  "3": "Then they said, \"The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.\"",
  "4": "But the king of Egypt said, \"Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!\"",
  "5": "Then Pharaoh said, \"Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.\"",
  "6": "That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:",
  "7": "\"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.",
  "8": "But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'",
  "9": "Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.\"",
  "10": "Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, \"This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw.",
  "11": "Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'\"",
  "12": "So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.",
  "13": "The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, \"Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.\"",
  "14": "The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, \"Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?\"",
  "15": "Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: \"Why have you treated your servants this way?",
  "16": "Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.\"",
  "17": "Pharaoh said, \"Lazy, that's what you are-lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'",
  "18": "Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.\"",
  "19": "The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, \"You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.\"",
  "20": "When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,",
  "21": "and they said, \"May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.\"",
  "22": "Moses returned to the LORD and said, \"O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?",
  "23": "Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.\""
