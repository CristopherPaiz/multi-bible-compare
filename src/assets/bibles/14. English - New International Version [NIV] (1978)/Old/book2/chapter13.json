  "8": "On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'",

  "15": "When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'",
  "16": "And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.\"",
  "17": "When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, \"If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.\"",
