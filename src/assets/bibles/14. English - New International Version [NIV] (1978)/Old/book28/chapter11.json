  "1": "\"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.",
  "2": "But the more I called Israel, the further they went from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.",
  "3": "It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.",
  "4": "I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love; I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them.",
  "5": "\"Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?",
  "6": "Swords will flash in their cities, will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans.",
  "7": "My people are determined to turn from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will by no means exalt them.",
  "8": "\"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.",
  "9": "I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I am God, and not man- the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath.",
  "10": "They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.",
  "11": "They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes,\" declares the LORD.",
  "12": "Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One."
