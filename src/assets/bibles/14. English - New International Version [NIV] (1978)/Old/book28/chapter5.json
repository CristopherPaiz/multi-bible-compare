  "1": "\"Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you Israelites! Listen, O royal house! This judgment is against you: You have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor.",
  "2": "The rebels are deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them.",
  "3": "I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt.",
  "4": "\"Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; they do not acknowledge the LORD.",
  "5": "Israel's arrogance testifies against them; the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them.",
  "6": "When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.",
  "7": "They are unfaithful to the LORD; they give birth to illegitimate children. Now their New Moon festivals will devour them and their fields.",
  "8": "\"Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven; lead on, O Benjamin.",

  "14": "For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them.",
  "15": "Then I will go back to my place until they admit their guilt. And they will seek my face; in their misery they will earnestly seek me.\""
