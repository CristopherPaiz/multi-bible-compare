  "1": "Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, \"As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.\"",
  "2": "Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah:",
  "3": "\"Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.",
  "4": "You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.\"",
  "5": "So he did what the LORD had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.",
  "6": "The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.",
  "7": "Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.",
  "8": "Then the word of the LORD came to him:",
  "9": "\"Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food.\"",
  "10": "So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, \"Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?\"",
  "11": "As she was going to get it, he called, \"And bring me, please, a piece of bread.\"",
  "12": "\"As surely as the LORD your God lives,\" she replied, \"I don't have any bread-only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it-and die.\"",
  "13": "Elijah said to her, \"Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.",
  "14": "For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives rain on the land.'\"",
  "15": "She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.",
  "16": "For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.",
  "17": "Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.",
  "18": "She said to Elijah, \"What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?\"",
  "19": "\"Give me your son,\" Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.",
  "20": "Then he cried out to the LORD, \"O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?\"",
  "21": "Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the LORD, \"O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!\"",
  "22": "The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.",
  "23": "Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, \"Look, your son is alive!\"",
  "24": "Then the woman said to Elijah, \"Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth.\""
