  "3": "Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, \"Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.",
  "4": "I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.I will redeem it,\" he said.",

  "6": "At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, \"Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.\"",
  "7": "(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)",

  "14": "The women said to Naomi: \"Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!",
  "15": "He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.\"",
