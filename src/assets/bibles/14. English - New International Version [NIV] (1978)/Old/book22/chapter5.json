  "1": "I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink your fill, O lovers.",
  "2": "I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking: \"Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.\"",
  "3": "I have taken off my robe- must I put it on again? I have washed my feet- must I soil them again?",
  "4": "My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.",
  "5": "I arose to open for my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.",
  "6": "I opened for my lover, but my lover had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.",
  "7": "The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!",
  "8": "O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you- if you find my lover, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.",
  "9": "How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you charge us so?",
  "10": "My lover is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.",
  "11": "His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.",
  "12": "His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.",
  "13": "His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.",
  "14": "His arms are rods of gold set with chrysolite. His body is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires.",
  "15": "His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.",
  "16": "His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my lover, this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."
