  "12": "The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, \"What about this awful crime that was committed among you?",
  "13": "Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.\" But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.",

  "29": "Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.",
  "30": "They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.",
  "31": "The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads-the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.",
  "32": "While the Benjamites were saying, \"We are defeating them as before,\" the Israelites were saying, \"Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.\"",
  "33": "All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah.",
  "34": "Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.",
  "35": "The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.",
  "36": "Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.",
  "37": "The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.",
  "38": "The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,",
  "39": "and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, \"We are defeating them as in the first battle.\"",
  "40": "But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.",
  "41": "Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.",
  "42": "So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.",
  "43": "They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.",
  "44": "Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.",
