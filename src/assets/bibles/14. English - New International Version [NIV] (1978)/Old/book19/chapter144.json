  "1": "Praise be to the LORD my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.",
  "2": "He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.",
  "3": "O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him?",
  "4": "Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.",
  "5": "Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.",
  "6": "Send forth lightning and scatter {the enemies}; shoot your arrows and rout them.",
  "7": "Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners",
  "8": "whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.",
  "9": "I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,",
  "10": "to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.",
  "11": "Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.",
  "12": "Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.",
  "13": "Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;",
  "14": "our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.",
  "15": "Blessed are the people of whom this is true; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD."
