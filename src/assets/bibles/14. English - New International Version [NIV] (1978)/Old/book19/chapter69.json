  "1": "Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.",
  "2": "I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.",
  "3": "I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.",
  "4": "Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.",
  "5": "You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.",
  "6": "May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.",
  "7": "For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.",
  "8": "I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;",
  "9": "for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.",
  "10": "When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;",
  "11": "when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.",
  "12": "Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.",
  "13": "But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.",
  "14": "Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.",
  "15": "Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.",
  "16": "Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.",
  "17": "Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.",
  "18": "Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes.",
  "19": "You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.",
  "20": "Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.",
  "21": "They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.",
  "22": "May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.",
  "23": "May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.",
  "24": "Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.",
  "25": "May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.",
  "26": "For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.",
  "27": "Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.",
  "28": "May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.",
  "29": "I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me.",
  "30": "I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.",
  "31": "This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.",
  "32": "The poor will see and be glad- you who seek God, may your hearts live!",
  "33": "The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.",
  "34": "Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,",
  "35": "for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;",
  "36": "the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there."
