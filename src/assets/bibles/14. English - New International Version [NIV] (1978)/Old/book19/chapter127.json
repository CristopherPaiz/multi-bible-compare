  "1": "Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.",
  "2": "In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat- for he grants sleep to those he loves.",
  "3": "Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth.",
  "5": "Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate."
