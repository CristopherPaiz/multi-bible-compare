  "1": "Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth",
  "2": "before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.",
  "3": "Restore us, O God; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.",
  "4": "O LORD God Almighty, how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?",
  "5": "You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.",
  "6": "You have made us a source of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.",
  "7": "Restore us, O God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.",
  "8": "You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.",
  "9": "You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.",
  "10": "The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.",
  "11": "It sent out its boughs to the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.",
  "12": "Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?",

  "14": "Return to us, O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,",
  "15": "the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.",
  "16": "Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.",
  "17": "Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.",
  "18": "Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.",
  "19": "Restore us, O LORD God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved."
