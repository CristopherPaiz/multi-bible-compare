  "1": "O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.",
  "2": "I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.",
  "3": "Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.",
  "4": "I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.",
  "5": "My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.",
  "6": "On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.",
  "7": "Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.",
  "8": "My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.",
  "9": "They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.",
