  "1": "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.",
  "2": "But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.",
  "3": "He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.",
  "4": "Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.",
  "5": "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.",
  "6": "For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish."
