  "1": "We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.",
  "2": "With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.",
  "3": "It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.",
  "4": "You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.",
  "5": "Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.",
  "6": "I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;",
  "7": "but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.",
  "8": "In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah",
  "9": "But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.",
  "10": "You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.",
  "11": "You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.",
  "12": "You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.",
  "13": "You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.",

  "15": "My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame",
  "16": "at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.",
  "17": "All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.",
  "18": "Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.",
  "19": "But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness.",
  "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,",
  "21": "would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?",
  "22": "Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.",
  "23": "Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.",
  "24": "Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?",
  "25": "We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.",
  "26": "Rise up and help us; redeem us because of your unfailing love."
