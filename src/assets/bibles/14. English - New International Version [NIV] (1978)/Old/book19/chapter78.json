  "4": "We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.",
  "5": "He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,",
  "6": "so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.",
  "7": "Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.",
  "8": "They would not be like their forefathers- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.",
  "9": "The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;",
  "10": "they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.",
  "11": "They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.",
  "12": "He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.",
  "13": "He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.",
  "14": "He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.",
  "15": "He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;",
  "16": "he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.",
  "17": "But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.",
  "18": "They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.",
  "19": "They spoke against God, saying, \"Can God spread a table in the desert?",
  "20": "When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?\"",
  "21": "When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,",
  "22": "for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.",
  "23": "Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;",
  "24": "he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.",
  "25": "Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.",
  "26": "He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.",
  "27": "He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.",
  "28": "He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.",
  "29": "They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.",
  "30": "But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,",
  "31": "God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.",
  "32": "In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.",

  "34": "Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.",
  "35": "They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.",
  "36": "But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;",
  "37": "their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.",
  "38": "Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.",
  "39": "He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.",
  "40": "How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!",
  "41": "Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.",
  "42": "They did not remember his power- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,",
  "43": "the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.",
  "44": "He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.",
  "45": "He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.",
  "46": "He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.",
  "47": "He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.",
  "48": "He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.",
  "49": "He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility- a band of destroying angels.",
  "50": "He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.",
  "51": "He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.",
  "52": "But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.",
  "53": "He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.",
  "54": "Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.",
  "55": "He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.",
  "56": "But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.",
  "57": "Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.",
  "58": "They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.",
  "59": "When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.",
  "60": "He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.",
  "61": "He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.",
  "62": "He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.",
  "63": "Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;",
  "64": "their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.",
  "65": "Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.",
  "66": "He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.",
  "67": "Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;",
  "68": "but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.",
  "69": "He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.",
  "70": "He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;",
  "71": "from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.",
  "72": "And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them."
