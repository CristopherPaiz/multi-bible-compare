  "1": "The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.",
  "2": "He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,",
  "3": "he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.",
  "4": "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.",
