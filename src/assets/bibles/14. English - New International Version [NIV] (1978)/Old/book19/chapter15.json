  "1": "LORD, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?",
  "2": "He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart",
  "3": "and has no slander on his tongue, who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman,",
  "4": "who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his oath even when it hurts,",
  "5": "who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken."
