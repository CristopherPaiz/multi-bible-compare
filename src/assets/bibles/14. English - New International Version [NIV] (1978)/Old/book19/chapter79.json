  "1": "O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.",
  "2": "They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.",
  "3": "They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.",
  "4": "We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.",
  "5": "How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;",
  "7": "for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.",
  "8": "Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.",
  "9": "Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.",
  "10": "Why should the nations say, \"Where is their God?\" Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.",
  "11": "May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.",
  "12": "Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.",
  "13": "Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise."
