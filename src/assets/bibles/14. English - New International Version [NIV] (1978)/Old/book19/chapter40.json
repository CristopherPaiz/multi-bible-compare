  "1": "I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.",
  "2": "He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.",
  "3": "He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.",
  "4": "Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.",
  "5": "Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.",
  "6": "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced,; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.",
  "7": "Then I said, \"Here I am, I have come- it is written about me in the scroll.",
  "8": "I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.\"",
  "9": "I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you know, O LORD.",
  "10": "I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.",
  "11": "Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.",
  "12": "For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.",
  "13": "Be pleased, O LORD, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.",
  "14": "May all who seek to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.",
  "15": "May those who say to me, \"Aha! Aha!\" be appalled at their own shame.",
  "16": "But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, \"The LORD be exalted!\"",
  "17": "Yet I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay."
