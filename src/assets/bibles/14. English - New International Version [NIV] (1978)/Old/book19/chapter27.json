  "1": "The LORD is my light and my salvation- whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life- of whom shall I be afraid?",
  "2": "When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.",
  "3": "Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident.",
  "4": "One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.",
  "5": "For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.",
  "6": "Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.",
  "7": "Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me.",
  "8": "My heart says of you, \"Seek his face!\" Your face, LORD, I will seek.",
  "9": "Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior.",
  "10": "Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.",
  "11": "Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.",
  "12": "Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.",
  "13": "I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.",
  "14": "Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD."
