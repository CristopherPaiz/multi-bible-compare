  "1": "Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer- it does not rise from deceitful lips.",
  "2": "May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.",
  "3": "Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.",
  "4": "As for the deeds of men- by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.",
  "5": "My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped.",
  "6": "I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.",
  "7": "Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.",
  "8": "Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings",
  "9": "from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.",
  "10": "They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.",
  "11": "They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.",
  "12": "They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover.",
  "13": "Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.",
  "14": "O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.",
  "15": "And I-in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness."
