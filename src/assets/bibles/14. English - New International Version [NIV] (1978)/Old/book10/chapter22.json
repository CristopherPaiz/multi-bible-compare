  "25": "The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.",
  "26": "\"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,",

  "28": "You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.",
  "29": "You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.",
  "30": "With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.",
  "31": "\"As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.",
  "32": "For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?",
  "33": "It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.",
  "34": "He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.",
  "35": "He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.",

  "41": "You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.",
  "42": "They cried for help, but there was no one to save them- to the LORD, but he did not answer.",
  "43": "I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.",
  "44": "\"You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me,",
  "45": "and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me.",
  "46": "They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.",
  "47": "\"The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!",
  "48": "He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,",
  "49": "who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.",
