  "6": "The Spirit of the LORD will come upon you in power, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.",
  "7": "Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.",

  "10": "When they arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he joined in their prophesying.",
  "11": "When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, \"What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\"",
  "12": "A man who lived there answered, \"And who is their father?\" So it became a saying: \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"",
  "13": "After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.",
  "14": "Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, \"Where have you been?Looking for the donkeys,\" he said. \"But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.\"",

  "25": "Samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own home.",
