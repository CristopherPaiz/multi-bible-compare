  "19": "The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.",
  "20": "And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.",
  "21": "The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word."
