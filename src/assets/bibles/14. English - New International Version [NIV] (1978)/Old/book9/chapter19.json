  "5": "He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?\"",

  "12": "So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.",
  "13": "Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.",
  "14": "When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, \"He is ill.\"",
  "15": "Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, \"Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.\"",
  "16": "But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.",
  "17": "Saul said to Michal, \"Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?\" Michal told him, \"He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'\"",
  "18": "When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.",
  "19": "Word came to Saul: \"David is in Naioth at Ramah\";",
  "20": "so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.",
  "21": "Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.",
  "22": "Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, \"Where are Samuel and David?Over in Naioth at Ramah,\" they said.",

  "24": "He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\""
