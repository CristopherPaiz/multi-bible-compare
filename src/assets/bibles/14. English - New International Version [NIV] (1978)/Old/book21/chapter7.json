  "2": "It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart.",
  "3": "Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.",
  "4": "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.",
  "5": "It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.",
  "6": "Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.",
  "7": "Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.",
