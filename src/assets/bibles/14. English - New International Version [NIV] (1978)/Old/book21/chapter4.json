  "1": "Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors- and they have no comforter.",
  "2": "And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.",
  "3": "But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.",
  "4": "And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
  "5": "The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.",
  "6": "Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.",
