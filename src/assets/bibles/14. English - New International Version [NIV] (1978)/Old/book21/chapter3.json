  "1": "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:",
  "2": "a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,",
  "3": "a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,",
  "4": "a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,",
  "5": "a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,",
  "6": "a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,",
  "7": "a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,",
  "8": "a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.",
  "9": "What does the worker gain from his toil?",
  "10": "I have seen the burden God has laid on men.",
  "11": "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.",
  "12": "I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.",
  "13": "That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil-this is the gift of God.",
  "14": "I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.",
  "15": "Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.",
  "16": "And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment-wickedness was there, in the place of justice-wickedness was there.",
  "17": "I thought in my heart, \"God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed.\"",
  "18": "I also thought, \"As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.",
  "19": "Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.",
  "20": "All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.",
  "21": "Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?\"",
  "22": "So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?"
