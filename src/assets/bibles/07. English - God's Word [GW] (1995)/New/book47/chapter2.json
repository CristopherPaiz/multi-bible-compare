  "1": "I decided not to visit you again while I was distressed.",
  "2": "After all, if I had made you uncomfortable, how could you have cheered me up when you were uncomfortable?",
  "3": "This is the very reason I wrote to you. I didn't want to visit you and be distressed by those who should make me happy. I'm confident about all of you that whatever makes me happy also makes you happy.",
  "4": "I was deeply troubled and anguished. In fact, I had tears in my eyes when I wrote to you. I didn't write to make you uncomfortable but to let you know how much I love you.",
  "5": "If someone caused distress, I'm not the one really affected. To some extent—although I don't want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you.",

  "14": "But I thank God, who always leads us in victory because of Christ. Wherever we go, God uses us to make clear what it means to know Christ. It's like a fragrance that fills the air.",
  "15": "To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are saved and among those who are dying.",
  "16": "To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a life-giving fragrance. Who is qualified to tell about Christ?",
  "17": "At least we don't go around selling an impure word of God like many others. The opposite is true. As Christ's spokesmen and in God's presence, we speak the pure message that comes from God."
