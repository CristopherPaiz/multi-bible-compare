  "1": "For this reason we must pay closer attention to what we have heard. Then we won't drift away {from the truth}.",
  "2": "After all, the message that the angels brought was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience was properly punished.",
  "3": "So how will we escape punishment if we reject the important message, the message that God saved us? First, the Lord told this saving message. Then those who heard him confirmed that message.",
  "4": "God verified what they said through miraculous signs, amazing things, other powerful acts, and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit as he wanted.",
  "5": "He didn't put the world that will come (about which we are talking) under the angels' control.",
  "6": "Instead, someone has declared this somewhere in Scripture: \"What is a mortal that you should remember him, or the Son of Man that you take care of him?",
  "7": "You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor.",
  "8": "You put everything under his control.\" When God put everything under his Son's control, nothing was left out. However, at the present time we still don't see everything under his Son's control.",
  "9": "Jesus was made a little lower than the angels, but we see him crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death. Through God's kindness he died on behalf of everyone.",
  "10": "God is the one for whom and through whom everything exists. Therefore, while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was the right time to bring Jesus, the source of their salvation, to the end of his work through suffering.",
  "11": "Jesus, who makes people holy, and all those who are made holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus isn't ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.",
  "12": "He says, \"I will tell my people about your name. I will praise you within the congregation.\"",
  "13": "In addition, Jesus says, \"I will trust him.\" And Jesus says, \"I am here with the sons and daughters God has given me.\"",
  "14": "Since all of these sons and daughters have flesh and blood, Jesus took on flesh and blood to be like them. He did this so that by dying he would destroy the one who had power over death (that is, the devil).",
  "15": "In this way he would free those who were slaves all their lives because they were afraid of dying.",
  "16": "So Jesus helps Abraham's descendants rather than helping angels.",
  "17": "Therefore, he had to become like his brothers and sisters so that he could be merciful. He became like them so that he could serve as a faithful chief priest in God's presence and make peace with God for their sins.",
  "18": "Because Jesus experienced temptation when he suffered, he is able to help others when they are tempted."
