  "2": "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first and foremost, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee;",
  "3": "Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James (son of Alphaeus), and Thaddaeus;",
  "4": "Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.",

  "7": "As you go, spread this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'",
  "8": "Cure the sick, bring the dead back to life, cleanse those with skin diseases, and force demons out of people. Give these things without charging, since you received them without paying.",
  "9": "\"Don't take any gold, silver, or even copper coins in your pockets.",
  "10": "Don't take a traveling bag for the trip, a change of clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. After all, the worker deserves to have his needs met.",

  "20": "Indeed, you're not the ones who will be speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.",

  "24": "\"A student is not better than his teacher. Nor is a slave better than his owner.",
  "25": "It is enough for a student to become like his teacher and a slave like his owner. If they have called the owner of the house Beelzebul, they will certainly call the family members the same name.",

  "36": "A person's enemies will be the members of his own family.",
  "37": "\"The person who loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve to be my disciple. The person who loves a son or daughter more than me does not deserve to be my disciple.",
  "38": "Whoever doesn't take up his cross and follow me doesn't deserve to be my disciple.",
  "39": "The person who tries to preserve his life will lose it, but the person who loses his life for me will preserve it.",
  "40": "\"The person who welcomes you welcomes me, and the person who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.",
