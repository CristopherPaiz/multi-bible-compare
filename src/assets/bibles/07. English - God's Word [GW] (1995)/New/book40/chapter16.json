  "1": "The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. So they asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.",
  "2": "He responded to them, \"In the evening you say that the weather will be fine because the sky is red.",
  "3": "And in the morning you say that there will be a storm today because the sky is red and overcast. You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.",
  "4": "\"Evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will be given is that of Jonah.\" Then he left them standing there and went away.",
  "5": "The disciples had forgotten to take any bread along when they went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.",
  "6": "Jesus said to them, \"Be careful! Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\"",
  "7": "The disciples had been discussing among themselves that they had not taken any bread along.",
  "8": "Jesus knew about their conversation and asked, \"Why are you discussing among yourselves that you don't have any bread? You have so little faith!",
  "9": "Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you filled?",
  "10": "Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many large baskets you filled?",
  "11": "Why don't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\"",
  "12": "Then they understood that he didn't say to watch out for the yeast in bread, but to watch out for the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
  "13": "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\"",
  "14": "They answered, \"Some say you are John the Baptizer, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\"",
  "15": "He asked them, \"But who do you say I am?\"",
  "16": "Simon Peter answered, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!\"",
  "17": "Jesus replied, \"Simon, son of Jonah, you are blessed! No human revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven revealed it to you.",
  "18": "You are Peter, and I can guarantee that on this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not overpower it.",
  "19": "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you imprison, God will imprison. And whatever you set free, God will set free.\"",
  "20": "Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.",
  "21": "From that time on Jesus began to inform his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem. There he would have to suffer a lot because of the leaders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be brought back to life.",
  "22": "Peter took him aside and objected to this. He said, \"Heaven forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you!\"",
  "23": "But Jesus turned and said to Peter, \"Get out of my way, Satan! You are tempting me to sin. You aren't thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think.\"",
  "24": "Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"Those who want to come with me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses, and follow me.",
  "25": "Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will find them.",
  "26": "What good will it do for people to win the whole world and lose their lives? Or what will a person give in exchange for life?",
  "27": "The Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father's glory. Then he will pay back each person based on what that person has done.",
  "28": "I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\""
