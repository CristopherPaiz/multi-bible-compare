  "5": "Or haven't you read in Moses' Teachings that on the day of worship the priests in the temple do things they shouldn't on the day of worship yet remain innocent?",
  "6": "I can guarantee that something greater than the temple is here.",

  "19": "He will not quarrel or shout, and no one will hear his voice in the streets.",

  "33": "\"Make a tree good, and then its fruit will be good. Or make a tree rotten, and then its fruit will be rotten. A person can recognize a tree by its fruit.",
  "34": "You poisonous snakes! How can you evil people say anything good? Your mouth says what comes from inside you.",

  "44": "Then it says, 'I'll go back to the home I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and in order.",
  "45": "Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before. That is what will happen to the evil people of this day.\"",
