  "1": "After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John (the brother of James) and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone.",
  "2": "Jesus' appearance changed in front of them. His face became as bright as the sun and his clothes as white as light.",
  "3": "Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them and were talking with Jesus.",
  "4": "Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it's good that we're here. If you want, I'll put up three tents hereâ€”one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\"",
  "5": "He was still speaking when a bright cloud overshadowed them. Then a voice came out of the cloud and said, \"This is my Son, whom I love and with whom I am pleased. Listen to him!\"",

  "9": "On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, \"Don't tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has been brought back to life.\"",
  "10": "So the disciples asked him, \"Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?\"",
  "11": "Jesus answered, \"Elijah is coming and will put everything in order again.",
  "12": "Actually, I can guarantee that Elijah has already come. Yet, people treated him as they pleased because they didn't recognize him. In the same way they're going to make the Son of Man suffer.\"",

  "25": "\"Certainly,\" he answered. Peter went into the house. Before he could speak, Jesus asked him, \"What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the world collect fees or taxes? Is it from their family members or from other people?\"",
