  "2": "When the day of worship came, he began to teach in the synagogue. He amazed many who heard him. They asked, \"Where did this man get these ideas? Who gave him this kind of wisdom and the ability to do such great miracles?",
  "3": "Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" So they took offense at him.",
  "4": "But Jesus told them, \"The only place a prophet isn't honored is in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.\"",
  "5": "He couldn't work any miracles there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them.",

  "30": "The apostles gathered around Jesus. They reported to him everything they had done and taught.",
  "31": "So he said to them, \"Let's go to a place where we can be alone to rest for a while.\" Many people were coming and going, and Jesus and the apostles didn't even have a chance to eat.",
  "32": "So they went away in a boat to a place where they could be alone.",
  "33": "But many people saw them leave and recognized them. The people ran from all the cities and arrived ahead of them.",
