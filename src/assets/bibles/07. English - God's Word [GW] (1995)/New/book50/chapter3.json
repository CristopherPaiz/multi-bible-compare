  "3": "We are the {true} circumcised people {of God} because we serve God's Spirit and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don't place any confidence in physical things,",
  "4": "although I could have confidence in my physical qualifications. If anyone else thinks that he can trust in something physical, I can claim even more.",
  "5": "I was circumcised on the eighth day. I'm a descendant of Israel. I'm from the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a pure-blooded Hebrew. When it comes to living up to standards, I was a Pharisee.",
  "6": "When it comes to being enthusiastic, I was a persecutor of the church. When it comes to winning God's approval by keeping Jewish laws, I was perfect.",
  "7": "These things that I once considered valuable, I now consider worthless for Christ.",
  "8": "It's far more than that! I consider everything else worthless because I'm much better off knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It's because of him that I think of everything as worthless. I threw it all away in order to gain Christ",

  "13": "Brothers and sisters, I can't consider myself a winner yet. This is what I do: I don't look back, I lengthen my stride, and",
  "14": "I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God's heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus.",
  "15": "Whoever has a mature faith should think this way. And if you think differently, God will show you how to think.",

  "18": "I have often told you, and now tell you with tears in my eyes, that many live as the enemies of the cross of Christ.",
  "19": "In the end they will be destroyed. Their own emotions are their god, and they take pride in the shameful things they do. Their minds are set on worldly things.",
  "20": "We, however, are citizens of heaven. We look forward to the Lord Jesus Christ coming from heaven as our Savior.",
  "21": "Through his power to bring everything under his authority, he will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified body."
