  "5": "After all, this is how holy women who had confidence in God expressed their beauty in the past. They placed themselves under their husbands' authority",
  "6": "as Sarah did. Sarah obeyed Abraham and spoke to him respectfully. You became Sarah's daughters by not letting anything make you afraid to do good.",
  "7": "Husbands, in a similar way, live with your wives with understanding since they are weaker than you are. Honor your wives as those who share God's life-giving kindness so that nothing will interfere with your prayers.",
