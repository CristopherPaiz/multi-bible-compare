  "7": "God's favor has been given to each of us. It was measured out to us by Christ who gave it.",
  "8": "That's why the Scriptures say: \"When he went to the highest place, he took captive those who had captured us and gave gifts to people.\"",
  "9": "Now what does it mean that he went up except that he also had gone down to the lowest parts of the earth?",

  "11": "He also gave apostles, prophets, missionaries, as well as pastors and teachers as gifts {to his church}.",

  "21": "You have certainly heard his message and have been taught his ways. The truth is in Jesus.",
  "22": "You were taught to change the way you were living. The person you used to be will ruin you through desires that deceive you.",
