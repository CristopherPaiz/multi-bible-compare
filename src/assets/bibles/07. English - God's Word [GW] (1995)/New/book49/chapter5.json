  "1": "Imitate God, since you are the children he loves.",
  "2": "Live in love as Christ also loved us. He gave his life for us as an offering and sacrifice, a soothing aroma to God.",
  "3": "Don't let sexual sin, perversion of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you. This is not appropriate behavior for God's holy people.",
  "4": "It's not right that dirty stories, foolish talk, or obscene jokes should be mentioned among you either. Instead, give thanks {to God}.",
  "5": "You know very well that no person who is involved in sexual sin, perversion, or greed (which means worshiping wealth) can have any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
  "6": "Don't let anyone deceive you with meaningless words. It is because of sins like these that God's anger comes to those who refuse to obey him.",
  "7": "Don't be partners with them.",
  "8": "Once you lived in the dark, but now the Lord has filled you with light. Live as children who have light.",

  "11": "Have nothing to do with the useless works that darkness produces. Instead, expose them for what they are.",
  "12": "It is shameful to talk about what some people do in secret.",
  "13": "Light exposes the true character of everything",
  "14": "because light makes everything easy to see. That's why it says: \"Wake up, sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\"",
  "15": "So then, be very careful how you live. Don't live like foolish people but like wise people.",
  "16": "Make the most of your opportunities because these are evil days.",
  "17": "So don't be foolish, but understand what the Lord wants.",
  "18": "Don't get drunk on wine, which leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Spirit",
  "19": "by reciting psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for your own good. Sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts.",
  "20": "Always thank God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "21": "Place yourselves under each other's authority out of respect for Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority.",
  "23": "The husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is his body, and he is its Savior.",
  "24": "As the church is under Christ's authority, so wives are under their husbands' authority in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.",
  "26": "He did this to make the church holy by cleansing it, washing it using water along with spoken words.",
  "27": "Then he could present it to himself as a glorious church, without any kind of stain or wrinkleâ€”holy and without faults.",
  "28": "So husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.",
  "29": "No one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds and takes care of it, as Christ takes care of the church.",
  "30": "We are parts of his body.",
  "31": "That's why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will be one.",
  "32": "This is a great mystery. (I'm talking about Christ's relationship to the church.)",
  "33": "But every husband must love his wife as he loves himself, and wives should respect their husbands."
