  "1": "Agrippa said to Paul, \"You're free to speak for yourself.\" Paul acknowledged King Agrippa and then began his defense.",
  "2": "\"King Agrippa, I think I'm fortunate today to stand in front of you and defend myself against every charge that the Jews brought against me.",
  "3": "I say this since you are especially familiar with every custom and controversy in Judaism. So I ask you to listen patiently to me.",
  "4": "\"All the Jews know how I lived the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem.",
  "5": "They've known me for a long time and can testify, if they're willing, that I followed the strictest party of our religion. They know that I lived my life as a Pharisee.",
  "6": "\"I'm on trial now because I expect God to keep the promise that he made to our ancestors.",
  "7": "Our twelve tribes expect this promise to be kept as they worship with intense devotion day and night. Your Majesty, the Jews are making accusations against me because I expect God to keep his promise.",
  "8": "Why do all of you refuse to believe that God can bring dead people back to life?",
  "9": "\"I used to think that I had to do a lot of things to oppose the one named Jesus of Nazareth.",
  "10": "That is what I did in Jerusalem. By the authority I received from the chief priests, I locked many Christians in prison. I voted to have them killed every time a vote was taken.",
  "11": "I even went to each synagogue, punished believers, and forced them to curse {the name of Jesus}. In my furious rage against them, I hunted them down in cities outside {Jerusalem}.",
  "12": "\"I was carrying out these activities when I went to the city of Damascus. I had the power and authority of the chief priests.",
  "13": "Your Majesty, at noon, while I was traveling, I saw a light that was brighter than the sun. The light came from the sky and shined around me and those who were with me.",
  "14": "All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It's hard for {a mortal like} you to resist God.'",
  "15": "\"I asked, 'Who are you, sir?' \"The Lord answered, 'I am Jesus, the one you're persecuting.",
  "16": "Stand up! I have appeared to you for a reason. I'm appointing you to be a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.",
  "17": "I will rescue you from the Jewish people and from the non-Jewish people to whom I am sending you.",
  "18": "You will open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's control to God's. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and a share among God's people who are made holy by believing in me.'",
  "19": "\"At that point I did not disobey the vision I saw from heaven, King Agrippa.",
  "20": "Instead, I spread the message that I first told to the {Jewish} people in Damascus and Jerusalem and throughout the whole country of Judea. I spread the same message to non-Jewish people. Both groups were expected to change the way they thought and acted and to turn to God. I told them to do things that prove they had changed their lives.",
  "21": "For this reason the Jews took me prisoner in the temple courtyard and tried to murder me.",
  "22": "\"God has been helping me to this day so that I can stand and testify to important and unimportant people. I tell them only what the prophets and Moses said would happen.",
  "23": "They said that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to come back to life and would spread light to Jewish and non-Jewish people.\"",
  "24": "As Paul was defending himself in this way, Festus shouted, \"Paul, you're crazy! Too much education is driving you crazy!\"",
  "25": "Paul replied, \"I'm not crazy, Your Excellency Festus. What I'm saying is true and sane.",
  "26": "I can easily speak to a king who knows about these things. I'm sure that none of these things has escaped his attention. None of this was done secretly.",
  "27": "King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!\"",
  "28": "Agrippa said to Paul, \"Do you think you can quickly persuade me to become a Christian?\"",
  "29": "Paul replied, \"I wish to God that you and everyone listening to me today would quickly and completely become as I am (except for being a prisoner).\"",
  "30": "The king, the governor, Bernice, and the people who were sitting with them got up.",
  "31": "As they were leaving, they said to each other, \"This man isn't doing anything for which he deserves to die or be put in prison.\"",
  "32": "Agrippa told Festus, \"This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed his case to the emperor.\""
