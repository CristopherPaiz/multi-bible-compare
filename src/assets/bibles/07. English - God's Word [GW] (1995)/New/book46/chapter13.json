  "1": "I may speak in the languages of humans and of angels. But if I don't have love, I am a loud gong or a clashing cymbal.",
  "2": "I may have the gift to speak what God has revealed, and I may understand all mysteries and have all knowledge. I may even have enough faith to move mountains. But if I don't have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "I may even give away all that I have and give up my body to be burned. But if I don't have love, none of these things will help me.",
  "4": "Love is patient. Love is kind. Love isn't jealous. It doesn't sing its own praises. It isn't arrogant.",
  "5": "It isn't rude. It doesn't think about itself. It isn't irritable. It doesn't keep track of wrongs.",
  "6": "It isn't happy when injustice is done, but it is happy with the truth.",
  "7": "Love never stops being patient, never stops believing, never stops hoping, never gives up.",
  "8": "Love never comes to an end. There is the gift of speaking what God has revealed, but it will no longer be used. There is the gift of speaking in other languages, but it will stop by itself. There is the gift of knowledge, but it will no longer be used.",
  "9": "Our knowledge is incomplete and our ability to speak what God has revealed is incomplete.",
  "10": "But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will no longer be used.",
  "11": "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I no longer used childish ways.",
  "12": "Now we see a blurred image in a mirror. Then we will see very clearly. Now my knowledge is incomplete. Then I will have complete knowledge as God has complete knowledge of me.",
  "13": "So these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the best one of these is love."
