  "1": "People should think of us as servants of Christ and managers who are entrusted with God's mysteries.",

  "3": "It means very little to me that you or any human court should cross-examine me. I don't even ask myself questions.",
  "4": "I have a clear conscience, but that doesn't mean I have God's approval. It is the Lord who cross-examines me.",
  "5": "Therefore, don't judge anything before the appointed time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will also bring to light what is hidden in the dark and reveal people's motives. Then each person will receive praise from God.",
  "6": "Brothers and sisters, I have applied this to Apollos and myself for your sake. You should learn from us not to go beyond what is written in Scripture. Then you won't arrogantly place one of us in opposition to the other.",
  "7": "Who says that you are any better than other people? What do you have that wasn't given to you? If you were given what you have, why are you bragging as if it weren't a gift?",

  "14": "I'm not writing this to make you feel ashamed but to instruct you as my dear children.",
  "15": "You may have countless Christian guardians, but you don't have many {spiritual} fathers. I became your father in the Christian life by telling you the Good News about Christ Jesus.",
  "16": "So I encourage you to imitate me.",
  "17": "That's why I've sent Timothy to you to help you remember my Christian way of life as I teach it everywhere in every church. Timothy is my dear child, and he faithfully does the Lord's work.",
  "18": "Some of you have become arrogant because you think I won't pay you a visit.",
  "19": "If it's the Lord's will, I'll visit you soon. Then I'll know what these arrogant people are saying and what power they have.",
  "20": "God's kingdom is not just talk, it is power.",
