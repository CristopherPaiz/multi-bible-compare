  "1": "From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ. To those who have obtained a faith that is as valuable as ours, a faith based on the approval that comes from our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.",
  "2": "May good will and peace fill your lives through your knowledge about Jesus, our God and Lord!",
  "3": "God's divine power has given us everything we need for life and for godliness. This power was given to us through knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and integrity.",
  "4": "Through his glory and integrity he has given us his promises that are of the highest value. Through these promises you will share in the divine nature because you have escaped the corruption that sinful desires cause in the world.",
  "5": "Because of this, make every effort to add integrity to your faith; and to integrity add knowledge;",
  "6": "to knowledge add self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness;",
  "7": "to godliness add Christian affection; and to Christian affection add love.",
  "8": "If you have these qualities and they are increasing, it demonstrates that your knowledge about our Lord Jesus Christ is living and productive.",
  "9": "If these qualities aren't present in your life, you're shortsighted and have forgotten that you were cleansed from your past sins.",
  "10": "Therefore, brothers and sisters, use more effort to make God's calling and choosing of you secure. If you keep doing this, you will never fall away.",
  "11": "Then you will also be given the wealth of entering into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "Therefore, I will always remind you about these qualities, although you already know about them and are well-grounded in the truth that you now have.",
  "13": "As long as I'm still alive, I think it's right to refresh your memory.",
  "14": "I know that I will die soon. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made that clear to me.",
  "15": "So I will make every effort to see that you remember these things after I die.",
  "16": "When we apostles told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we didn't base our message on clever myths that we made up. Rather, we witnessed his majesty with our own eyes.",
  "17": "For example, we were eyewitnesses when he received honor and glory from God the Father and when the voice of our majestic God spoke these words to him: \"This is my Son, whom I love and in whom I delight.\"",
  "18": "We heard that voice speak to him from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.",
  "19": "So we regard the words of the prophets as confirmed beyond all doubt. You're doing well by paying attention to their words. Continue to pay attention as you would to a light that shines in a dark place as you wait for day to come and the morning star to rise in your hearts.",
  "20": "First, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation.",
  "21": "No prophecy ever originated from humans. Instead, it was given by the Holy Spirit as humans spoke under God's direction."
