  "1": "{Then Jesus said,} \"I am the true vine, and my Father takes care of the vineyard.",
  "2": "He removes every one of my branches that doesn't produce fruit. He also prunes every branch that does produce fruit to make it produce more fruit.",
  "3": "\"You are already clean because of what I have told you.",
  "4": "Live in me, and I will live in you. A branch cannot produce any fruit by itself. It has to stay attached to the vine. In the same way, you cannot produce fruit unless you live in me.",
  "5": "\"I am the vine. You are the branches. Those who live in me while I live in them will produce a lot of fruit. But you can't produce anything without me.",
  "6": "Whoever doesn't live in me is thrown away like a branch and dries up. Branches like this are gathered, thrown into a fire, and burned.",
  "7": "If you live in me and what I say lives in you, then ask for anything you want, and it will be yours.",
  "8": "You give glory to my Father when you produce a lot of fruit and therefore show that you are my disciples.",
  "9": "\"I have loved you the same way the Father has loved me. So live in my love.",
  "10": "If you obey my commandments, you will live in my love. I have obeyed my Father's commandments, and in that way I live in his love.",
  "11": "I have told you this so that you will be as joyful as I am, and your joy will be complete.",
  "12": "Love each other as I have loved you. This is what I'm commanding you to do.",
  "13": "The greatest love you can show is to give your life for your friends.",
  "14": "You are my friends if you obey my commandments.",
  "15": "I don't call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn't know what his master is doing. But I've called you friends because I've made known to you everything that I've heard from my Father.",
  "16": "You didn't choose me, but I chose you. I have appointed you to go, to produce fruit that will last, and to ask the Father in my name to give you whatever you ask for.",
  "17": "Love each other. This is what I'm commanding you to do.",
  "18": "\"If the world hates you, realize that it hated me before it hated you.",
  "19": "If you had anything in common with the world, the world would love you as one of its own. But you don't have anything in common with the world. I chose you from the world, and that's why the world hates you.",
  "20": "Remember what I told you: 'A servant isn't greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they did what I said, they will also do what you say.",
  "21": "Indeed, they will do all this to you because you are committed to me, since they don't know the one who sent me.",
  "22": "If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "The person who hates me also hates my Father.",
  "24": "If I hadn't done among them what no one else has done, they wouldn't have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.",
  "25": "In this way what is written in their Scriptures has come true: 'They hate me for no reason.'",
  "26": "\"The helper whom I will send to you from the Father will come. This helper, the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, will declare the truth about me.",
  "27": "You will declare the truth, too, because you have been with me from the beginning.\""
