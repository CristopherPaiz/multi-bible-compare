  "1": "Before the Passover festival, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. Jesus loved his own who were in the world, and he loved them to the end.",
  "2": "While supper was taking place, the devil had already put the idea of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.",
  "3": "The Father had put everything in Jesus' control. Jesus knew that. He also knew that he had come from God and was going back to God.",
  "4": "So he got up from the table, removed his outer clothes, took a towel, and tied it around his waist.",
  "5": "Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel that he had tied around his waist.",
  "6": "When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter asked him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\"",
  "7": "Jesus answered Peter, \"You don't know now what I'm doing. You will understand later.\"",
  "8": "Peter told Jesus, \"You will never wash my feet.\" Jesus replied to Peter, \"If I don't wash you, you don't belong to me.\"",
  "9": "Simon Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, don't wash only my feet. Wash my hands and my head too!\"",
  "10": "Jesus told Peter, \"People who have washed are completely clean. They need to have only their feet washed. All of you, except for one, are clean.\"",
  "11": "(Jesus knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said, \"All of you, except for one, are clean.\")",
  "12": "After Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer clothes, he took his place at the table again. Then he asked his disciples, \"Do you understand what I've done for you?",
  "13": "You call me teacher and Lord, and you're right because that's what I am.",
  "14": "So if I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you must wash each other's feet.",
  "15": "I've given you an example that you should follow.",
  "16": "I can guarantee this truth: Slaves are not superior to their owners, and messengers are not superior to the people who send them.",
  "17": "If you understand all of this, you are blessed whenever you follow my example.",
  "18": "\"I'm not talking about all of you. I know the people I've chosen {to be apostles}. However, I've made my choice so that Scripture will come true. It says, 'The one who eats my bread has turned against me.'",
  "19": "I'm telling you now before it happens. Then, when it happens, you will believe that I am the one.",
  "20": "\"I can guarantee this truth: Whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.\"",
  "21": "After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled. He declared, \"I can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me!\"",
  "22": "The disciples began looking at each other and wondering which one of them Jesus meant.",
  "23": "One disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, was near him at the table.",
  "24": "Simon Peter motioned to that disciple and said, \"Ask Jesus whom he's talking about!\"",
  "25": "Leaning close to Jesus, that disciple asked, \"Lord, who is it?\"",
  "26": "Jesus answered, \"He's the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I've dipped it in the sauce.\" So Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.",
  "27": "Then, after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered him. So Jesus told him, \"Hurry! Do what you have to do.\"",
  "28": "No one at the table knew why Jesus said this to him.",
  "29": "Judas had the moneybag. So some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the poor.",
  "30": "Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went outside. It was night.",
  "31": "When Judas was gone, Jesus said, \"The Son of Man is now glorified, and because of him God is glorified.",
  "32": "If God is glorified because of the Son of Man, God will glorify the Son of Man because of himself, and he will glorify the Son of Man at once.\"",
  "33": "Jesus said, \"Dear children, I will still be with you for a little while. I'm telling you what I told the Jews. You will look for me, but you can't go where I'm going.",

  "35": "Everyone will know that you are my disciples because of your love for each other.\"",
  "36": "Simon Peter asked him, \"Lord, where are you going?\" Jesus answered him, \"You can't follow me now to the place where I'm going. However, you will follow me later.\"",
  "37": "Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, why can't I follow you now? I'll give my life for you.\"",
  "38": "Jesus replied, \"Will you give your life for me? I can guarantee this truth: No rooster will crow until you say three times that you don't know me."
