  "2": "You will be thrown out of synagogues. Certainly, the time is coming when people who murder you will think that they are serving God.",
  "3": "They will do these things to you because they haven't known the Father or me.",
  "4": "But I've told you this so that when it happens you'll remember what I've told you. I didn't tell you this at first, because I was with you.",
  "5": "\"Now I'm going to the one who sent me. Yet, none of you asks me where I'm going.",
  "6": "But because I've told you this, you're filled with sadness.",
  "7": "However, I am telling you the truth: It's good for you that I'm going away. If I don't go away, the helper won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.",
  "8": "He will come to convict the world of sin, to show the world what has God's approval, and to convince the world that God judges it.",
  "9": "He will convict the world of sin, because people don't believe in me.",
  "10": "He will show the world what has God's approval, because I'm going to the Father and you won't see me anymore.",
  "11": "He will convince the world that God judges it, because the ruler of this world has been judged.",
  "12": "\"I have a lot more to tell you, but that would be too much for you now.",
  "13": "When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into the full truth. He won't speak on his own. He will speak what he hears and will tell you about things to come.",
  "14": "He will give me glory, because he will tell you what I say.",
  "15": "Everything the Father says is also what I say. That is why I said, 'He will take what I say and tell it to you.'",
  "16": "\"In a little while you won't see me anymore. Then in a little while you will see me again.\"",
  "17": "Some of his disciples said to each other, \"What does he mean? He tells us that in a little while we won't see him. Then he tells us that in a little while we will see him again and that he's going to the Father.\"",
  "18": "So they were asking each other, \"What does he mean when he says, 'In a little while'? We don't understand what he's talking about.\"",
  "19": "Jesus knew they wanted to ask him something. So he said to them, \"Are you trying to figure out among yourselves what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you won't see me, and in a little while you will see me again'?",
  "20": "I can guarantee this truth: You will cry because you are sad, but the world will be happy. You will feel pain, but your pain will turn to happiness.",
  "21": "A woman has pain when her time to give birth comes. But after the child is born, she doesn't remember the pain anymore because she's happy that a child has been brought into the world.",
  "22": "\"Now you're in a painful situation. But I will see you again. Then you will be happy, and no one will take that happiness away from you.",
  "23": "When that day comes, you won't ask me any more questions. I can guarantee this truth: If you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you.",
  "24": "So far you haven't asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive so that you can be completely happy.",
  "25": "\"I have used examples to illustrate these things. The time is coming when I won't use examples to speak to you. Rather, I will speak to you about the Father in plain words.",
  "26": "When that day comes, you will ask for what you want in my name. I'm telling you that I won't have to ask the Father for you.",
  "27": "The Father loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.",
  "28": "I left the Father and came into the world. Again, {as I've said,} I'm going to leave the world and go back to the Father.\"",
  "29": "His disciples said, \"Now you're talking in plain words and not using examples.",
  "30": "Now we know that you know everything. You don't need to wait for questions to be asked. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.\"",
  "31": "Jesus replied to them, \"Now you believe.",
  "32": "The time is coming, and is already here, when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go your own way and leave me all alone. Yet, I'm not all alone, because the Father is with me.",
  "33": "I've told you this so that my peace will be with you. In the world you'll have trouble. But cheer up! I have overcome the world.\""
