  "33": "By saying this, he indicated how he was going to die.",
  "34": "The crowd responded to him, \"We have heard from the Scriptures that the Messiah will remain here forever. So how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\"",
  "35": "Jesus answered the crowd, \"The light will still be with you for a little while. Walk while you have light so that darkness won't defeat you. Those who walk in the dark don't know where they're going.",
