  "18": "Those who believe in him won't be condemned. But those who don't believe are already condemned because they don't believe in God's only Son.",
  "19": "This is why people are condemned: The light came into the world. Yet, people loved the dark rather than the light because their actions were evil.",
  "20": "People who do what is wrong hate the light and don't come to the light. They don't want their actions to be exposed.",
