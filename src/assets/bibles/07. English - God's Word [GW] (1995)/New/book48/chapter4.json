  "5": "God sent him to pay for the freedom of those who were controlled by these laws so that we would be adopted as his children.",
  "6": "Because you are God's children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into us to call out, \"Abba! Father!\"",
  "7": "So you are no longer slaves but God's children. Since you are God's children, God has also made you heirs.",
  "8": "When you didn't know God, you were slaves to things which are really not gods at all.",

  "11": "I'm afraid for you. Maybe the hard work I spent on you has been wasted.",
  "12": "Brothers and sisters, I beg you to become like me. After all, I became like you were. You didn't do anything wrong to me.",
  "13": "You know that the first time I brought you the Good News I was ill.",
  "14": "Even though my illness was difficult for you, you didn't despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were God's messenger or Christ Jesus himself.",
  "15": "What happened to your positive attitude? It's a fact that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.",
  "16": "Can it be that I have become your enemy for telling you the truth?",
  "17": "These people {who distort the Good News} are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They don't want you to associate with me so that you will be devoted only to them.",
  "18": "(Devotion to a good cause is always good, even when I'm not with you.)",

  "24": "I'm going to use these historical events as an illustration. The women illustrate two arrangements. The one woman, Hagar, is the arrangement made on Mount Sinai. Her children are born into slavery.",

  "28": "Now you, brothers and sisters, are children of the promise like Isaac.",
  "29": "Furthermore, at that time the son who was conceived in a natural way persecuted the son conceived in a spiritual way. That's exactly what's happening now.",
  "30": "But what does Scripture say? \"Get rid of the slave woman and her son, because the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.\"",
  "31": "Brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman."
