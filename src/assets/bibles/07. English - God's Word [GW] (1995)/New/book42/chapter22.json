  "1": "The Festival of Unleavened Bread, called Passover, was near.",
  "2": "The chief priests and the scribes were looking for some way to kill Jesus. However, they were afraid of the people.",
  "3": "Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles.",
  "4": "Judas went to the chief priests and the temple guards and discussed with them how he could betray Jesus.",
  "5": "They were pleased and agreed to give him some money.",
  "6": "So Judas promised to do it. He kept looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them when there was no crowd.",
  "7": "The day came during the Festival of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb had to be killed.",
  "8": "Jesus sent Peter and John and told them, \"Go, prepare the Passover lamb for us to eat.\"",
  "9": "They asked him, \"Where do you want us to prepare it?\"",
  "10": "He told them, \"Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him into the house he enters.",
  "11": "Tell the owner of the house that the teacher asks, 'Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'",
  "12": "He will take you upstairs and show you a large furnished room. Get things ready there.\"",
  "13": "The disciples left. They found everything as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover.",
  "14": "When it was time to eat the Passover meal, Jesus and the apostles were at the table.",
  "15": "Jesus said to them, \"I've had a deep desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.",
  "16": "I can guarantee that I won't eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\"",
  "17": "Then he took a cup and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He said, \"Take this, and share it.",
  "18": "I can guarantee that from now on I won't drink this wine until the kingdom of God comes.\"",
  "19": "Then Jesus took bread and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the bread, gave it to them, and said, \"This is my body, which is given up for you. Do this to remember me.\"",
  "20": "When supper was over, he did the same with the cup. He said, \"This cup that is poured out for you is the new promise made with my blood.\"",
  "21": "\"The hand of the one who will betray me is with me on the table.",
  "22": "The Son of Man is going to die the way it has been planned for him. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays him.\"",
  "23": "So they began to discuss with each other who could do such a thing.",
  "24": "Then a quarrel broke out among the disciples. They argued about who should be considered the greatest.",
  "25": "Jesus said to them, \"The kings of nations have power over their people, and those in authority call themselves friends of the people.",
  "26": "But you're not going to be that way! Rather, the greatest among you must be like the youngest, and your leader must be like a servant.",
  "27": "Who's the greatest, the person who sits at the table or the servant? Isn't it really the person who sits at the table? But I'm among you as a servant.",
  "28": "\"You have stood by me in the troubles that have tested me.",
  "29": "So as my Father has given me a kingdom, I'm giving it to you.",
  "30": "You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will also sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.\"",
  "31": "{Then the Lord said,} \"Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to have you apostles for himself. He wants to separate you from me as a farmer separates wheat from husks.",
  "32": "But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. So when you recover, strengthen the other disciples.\"",
  "33": "But Peter said to him, \"Lord, I'm ready to go to prison with you and to die with you.\"",
  "34": "Jesus replied, \"Peter, I can guarantee that the rooster won't crow tonight until you say three times that you don't know me.\"",
  "35": "Then Jesus said to them, \"When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn't lack anything, did you?\" \"Not a thing!\" they answered.",
  "36": "Then he said to them, \"But now, the person who has a wallet and a traveling bag should take them along. The person who doesn't have a sword should sell his coat and buy one.",
  "37": "I can guarantee that the Scripture passage which says, 'He was counted with criminals,' must find its fulfillment in me. Indeed, whatever is written about me will come true.\"",
  "38": "The disciples said, \"Lord, look! Here are two swords!\" Then Jesus said to them, \"That's enough!\"",
  "39": "Jesus went out {of the city} to the Mount of Olives as he usually did. His disciples followed him.",
  "40": "When he arrived, he said to them, \"Pray that you won't be tempted.\"",
  "41": "Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and prayed,",
  "42": "\"Father, if it is your will, take this cup {of suffering} away from me. However, your will must be done, not mine.\"",
  "43": "Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.",
  "44": "So he prayed very hard in anguish. His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.",
  "45": "When Jesus ended his prayer, he got up and went to the disciples. He found them asleep and overcome with sadness.",
  "46": "He said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up, and pray that you won't be tempted.\"",
  "47": "While he was still speaking to the disciples, a crowd arrived. The man called Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was leading them. He came close to Jesus to kiss him.",
  "48": "Jesus said to him, \"Judas, do you intend to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?\"",
  "49": "The men who were with Jesus saw what was going to happen. So they asked him, \"Lord, should we use our swords to fight?\"",
  "50": "One of the disciples cut off the right ear of the chief priest's servant.",
  "51": "But Jesus said, \"Stop! That's enough of this.\" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.",
  "52": "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple guards, and leaders who had come for him, \"Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?",
  "53": "I was with you in the temple courtyard every day and you didn't try to arrest me. But this is your time, when darkness rules.\"",
  "54": "So they arrested Jesus and led him away to the chief priest's house. Peter followed at a distance.",
  "55": "Some men had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard. As they sat together, Peter sat among them.",
  "56": "A female servant saw him as he sat facing the glow of the fire. She stared at him and said, \"This man was with Jesus.\"",
  "57": "But Peter denied it by saying, \"I don't know him, woman.\"",
  "58": "A little later someone else saw Peter and said, \"You are one of them.\" But Peter said, \"Not me!\"",
  "59": "About an hour later another person insisted, \"It's obvious that this man was with him. He's a Galilean!\"",
  "60": "But Peter said, \"I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.",
  "61": "Then the Lord turned and looked directly at Peter. Peter remembered what the Lord had said: \"Before a rooster crows today, you will say three times that you don't know me.\"",
  "62": "Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly.",
  "63": "The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him as they beat him.",
  "64": "They blindfolded him and said to him, \"Tell us who hit you.\"",
  "65": "They also insulted him in many other ways.",
  "66": "In the morning the council of the people's leaders, the chief priests and the scribes, gathered together. They brought Jesus in front of their highest court and asked him,",
  "67": "\"Tell us, are you the Messiah?\" Jesus said to them, \"If I tell you, you won't believe me.",
  "68": "And if I ask you, you won't answer.",
  "69": "But from now on, the Son of Man will be in the highest position in heaven.\"",
  "70": "Then all of them said, \"So you're the Son of God?\" Jesus answered them, \"You're right to say that I am.\"",
  "71": "Then they said, \"Why do we need any more testimony? We've heard him say it ourselves.\""
