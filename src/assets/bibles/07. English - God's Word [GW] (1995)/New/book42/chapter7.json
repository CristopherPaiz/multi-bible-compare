  "6": "Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the officer sent friends to tell Jesus, \"Sir, don't bother. I don't deserve to have you come into my house.",
  "7": "That's why I didn't come to you. But just give a command, and let my servant be cured.",
  "8": "As you know, I'm in a chain of command and have soldiers at my command. I tell one of them, 'Go!' and he goes, and another, 'Come!' and he comes. I tell my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it.\"",
  "9": "Jesus was amazed at the officer when he heard these words. He turned to the crowd following him and said, \"I can guarantee that I haven't found faith as great as this in Israel.\"",
  "10": "When the men who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant healthy again.",
  "11": "Soon afterward, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went with him.",
  "12": "As he came near the entrance to the city, he met a funeral procession. The dead man was a widow's only child. A large crowd from the city was with her.",
  "13": "When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her. He said to her, \"Don't cry.\"",
  "14": "He went up to the open coffin, took hold of it, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said, \"Young man, I'm telling you to come back to life!\"",
  "15": "The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.",
  "16": "Everyone was struck with fear and praised God. They said, \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" and \"God has taken care of his people.\"",
  "17": "This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region.",
  "18": "John's disciples told him about all these things. Then John called two of his disciples",

  "24": "When John's messengers had left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. \"What did you go into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind?",
  "25": "Really, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear splendid clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces.",
  "26": "Really, what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet.",
  "27": "John is the one about whom Scripture says, 'I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare the way in front of you.'",
  "28": "I can guarantee that of all the people ever born, no one is greater than John. Yet, the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John.",
  "29": "\"All the people, including tax collectors, heard John. They admitted that God was right by letting John baptize them.",
  "30": "But the Pharisees and the experts in Moses' Teachings rejected God's plan for them. They refused to be baptized.",
  "31": "\"How can I describe the people who are living now? What are they like?",
  "32": "They are like children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other, 'We played music for you, but you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song, but you didn't cry.'",
  "33": "John the Baptizer has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'There's a demon in him!'",
  "34": "The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him! He's a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'",
  "35": "\"Yet, wisdom is proved right by all its results.\"",
  "36": "One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went to the Pharisee's house and was eating at the table.",
  "37": "A woman who lived a sinful life in that city found out that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house. So she took a bottle of perfume",
  "38": "and knelt at his feet. She was crying and washed his feet with her tears. Then she dried his feet with her hair, kissed them over and over again, and poured the perfume on them.",
  "39": "The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and thought, \"If this man really were a prophet, he would know what sort of woman is touching him. She's a sinner.\"",
  "40": "Jesus spoke up, \"Simon, I have something to say to you.\" Simon replied, \"Teacher, you're free to speak.\"",
  "41": "{So Jesus said,} \"Two men owed a moneylender some money. One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty.",
  "42": "When they couldn't pay it back, he was kind enough to cancel their debts. Now, who do you think will love him the most?\"",
  "43": "Simon answered, \"I suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled.\" Jesus said to him, \"You're right!\"",
  "44": "Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, \"You see this woman, don't you? I came into your house. You didn't wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.",
  "45": "You didn't give me a kiss. But ever since I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.",
  "46": "You didn't put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured perfume on my feet.",
  "47": "That's why I'm telling you that her many sins have been forgiven. Her great love proves that. But whoever receives little forgiveness loves very little.\"",
  "48": "Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins have been forgiven.\"",
  "49": "The other guests thought, \"Who is this man who even forgives sins?\"",
  "50": "Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you. Go in peace!\""
