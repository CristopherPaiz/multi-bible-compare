  "5": "I'll have to give her justice. Otherwise, she'll keep coming to me until she wears me out.' \"",
  "6": "The Lord added, \"Pay attention to what the dishonest judge thought.",
  "7": "Won't God give his chosen people justice when they cry out to him for help day and night? Is he slow to help them?",
