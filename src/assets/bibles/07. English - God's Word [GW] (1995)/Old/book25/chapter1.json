  "1": "\"Look how deserted Jerusalem is! Once the city was crowded with people. Once it was important among the nations. Now it is a widow. Once it was a princess among the provinces. Now it does forced labor.",
  "2": "Jerusalem cries bitterly at night with tears running down its cheeks. Out of all those who love the city, no one offers it comfort. All of Jerusalem's friends have betrayed it and become its enemies.",
  "3": "\"Judah has been exiled after {much} suffering and harsh treatment. Its {people} live among the nations; they find no rest. Those who chased them caught up with them in places where there was no way out.",
  "4": "\"The roads to Zion are deserted. No one comes to the annual festivals. No one passes through any of its gates. Its priests are groaning. Its young women are made to suffer. Zion is bitter.",
  "5": "Its opponents are now in control. Its enemies have no worries. The Lord made Zion suffer for its many rebellious acts. Its children go ahead of their opponents into captivity.",
  "6": "All splendor has abandoned the people of Zion. Its influential people were like deer that couldn't find any pasture. They ran without any strength ahead of the hunters.",

  "13": "He sent fire from above. He made it go deep into my bones. He spread a net for my feet. He made me turn back. He has left me devastated. He has made me sick all day long.",
  "14": "My rebellious acts are a heavy burden for me. They were tied together by God's own hands. They were tied around my neck. He has weakened me {with them}. The Lord has handed me over to people I cannot oppose.",
  "15": "The Lord has treated all the warriors inside my {walls} with contempt. He called an army to defeat my young men. The Lord trampled the people of Judah in a winepress.",
  "16": "I'm crying because of {all} these things. My eyesâ€”my eyes flow with tears. No one can give me the comfort I need to keep me alive. Everyone is too far away from me. My children are devastated because my enemies have won.\"",
