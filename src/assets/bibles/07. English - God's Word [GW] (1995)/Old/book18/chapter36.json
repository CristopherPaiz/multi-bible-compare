  "4": "Certainly, my words are not lies. The one who knows everything is {speaking} with you.",
  "5": "\"Certainly, God is mighty. He doesn't despise anyone. He is mighty and brave.",
  "6": "He doesn't allow the wicked person to live. He grants justice to those who are oppressed.",
  "7": "He doesn't take his eyes off righteous people. He seats them on thrones with kings to honor them forever.",
  "8": "However, if righteous people are bound in chains and tangled in ropes of misery,",

  "10": "He makes them listen to his warning and orders them to turn away from wrong.",
  "11": "\"If righteous people listen and serve {him}, they will live out their days in prosperity and their years in comfort.",

  "26": "\"Certainly, God is so great that he is beyond our understanding. The number of his years cannot be counted.",
  "27": "He collects drops of water. He distills rain from his mist,",
  "28": "which then drips from the clouds. It pours down on many people.",
  "29": "Can anyone really understand how clouds spread out or how he thunders from his dwelling place?",
  "30": "Look, he scatters his flashes of lightning around him and covers the depths of the sea.",

  "33": "The thunder announces his coming. The storm announces his angry wrath."
