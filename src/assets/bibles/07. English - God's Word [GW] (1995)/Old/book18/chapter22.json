  "4": "Does God correct you and bring you into a court of law because you fear him?",
  "5": "\"Aren't you really very wicked? Is there no end to your wrongdoing?",
  "6": "For no reason you take your brothers' goods as security for a loan and strip them of their clothes.",
  "7": "You don't even give a tired person a drink of water, and you take food away from hungry people.",
  "8": "A strong person owns the land. A privileged person lives in it.",
  "9": "You send widows away empty-handed, and the arms of orphans are broken.",

  "20": "'Indeed, their wealth has been wiped out, and a fire has burned up what {little} they had left.'",
  "21": "\"Be in harmony and at peace with God. In this way you will have prosperity.",
  "22": "Accept instruction from his mouth, and keep his words in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will prosper. If you put wrongdoing out of your tent,",

  "25": "then the Almighty will become your gold and your large supply of silver.",
  "26": "Then you will be happy with the Almighty and look up toward God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him, and he will listen to you, and you will keep your vow to him.",
  "28": "When you promise to do something, you will succeed, and light will shine on your path.",
  "29": "When others are discouraged, you will say, 'Cheer up!' Then he will save the humble person.",
