  "1": "\"Can you pull Leviathan out {of the water} with a fishhook or tie its tongue down with a rope?",
  "2": "Can you put a ring through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook?",
  "3": "Will it plead with you for mercy or speak tenderly to you?",
  "4": "Will it make an agreement with you so that you can take it as your permanent slave?",
  "5": "Can you play with it like a bird or keep it on a leash for your girls?",
  "6": "Will traders bargain over it and divide it among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "Lay your hand on it. Think of the struggle! Don't do it again!",
  "9": "Certainly, any hope {of defeating it} is a false hope. Doesn't the sight of it overwhelm you?",
  "10": "No one is brave enough to provoke Leviathan. Then who can stand in front of me?",
  "11": "Who can confront me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven belongs to me!",
  "12": "\"I will not be silent about Leviathan's limbs, its strength, or its graceful form.",
  "13": "Who can skin its hide? Who can approach it with a harness?",
  "14": "Who can open its closed mouth? Its teeth are surrounded by terror.",
  "15": "Its back has rows of scales that are tightly sealed.",
  "16": "One is so close to the other that there is no space between them.",
  "17": "Each is joined to the other. They are locked together and inseparable.",
  "18": "When Leviathan sneezes, it gives out a flash of light. Its eyes are like the first rays of the dawn.",
  "19": "Flames shoot from its mouth. Sparks of fire fly from it.",
  "20": "Smoke comes from its nostrils like a boiling pot heated over brushwood.",
  "21": "Its breath sets coals on fire, and a flame pours from its mouth.",
  "22": "Strength resides in its neck, and power dances in front of it.",
  "23": "The folds of its flesh stick to each other. They are solid and cannot be moved.",
  "24": "Its chest is solid like a rock, solid like a millstone.",
  "25": "\"The mighty are afraid when Leviathan rises. Broken down, they draw back.",
  "26": "A sword may strike it but not pierce it. Neither will a spear, lance, or dart.",
  "27": "It considers iron to be like straw and bronze to be like rotten wood.",
  "28": "An arrow won't make it run away. Stones from a sling turn to dust against it.",
  "29": "It considers clubs to be like stubble, and it laughs at a rattling javelin.",
  "30": "Its underside is like sharp pieces of broken pottery. It stretches out like a threshing sledge on the mud.",
  "31": "It makes the deep sea boil like a pot. It stirs up the ocean like a boiling kettle.",
  "32": "It leaves a shining path behind it so that the sea appears to have silvery hair.",
  "33": "Nothing on land can compare to it. It was made fearless.",
  "34": "It looks down on all high things. It is king of everyone who is arrogant.\""
