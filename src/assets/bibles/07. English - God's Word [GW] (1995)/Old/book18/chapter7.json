  "1": "\"Isn't a mortal's stay on earth difficult like a hired hand's daily {work}?",
  "2": "Like a slave, he longs for shade. Like a hired hand, he eagerly looks for his pay.",
  "3": "Likewise, I have been given months that are of no use, and I have inherited nights filled with misery.",
  "4": "When I lie down, I ask, 'When will I get up?' But the evening is long, and I'm exhausted from tossing about until dawn.",
  "5": "My body is covered with maggots and scabs. My skin is crusted over with sores; then they ooze.",
  "6": "My days go swifter than a weaver's shuttle. They are spent without hope.",
  "7": "Remember, my life is only a breath, and never again will my eyes see anything good.",
  "8": "The eye that watches over me will no longer see me. Your eye will look for me, but I'll be gone.",
  "9": "As a cloud fades away and disappears, so a person goes into the grave and doesn't come back again.",
  "10": "He doesn't come back home again, and his household doesn't recognize him anymore.",
  "11": "So I won't keep my mouth shut, but I will speak from the distress that is in my spirit and complain about the bitterness in my soul.",
  "12": "\"Am I the sea or a sea monster that you have set a guard over me?",
  "13": "When I say, 'My couch may give me comfort. My bed may help me bear my pain,'",
  "14": "then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions.",
  "15": "My throat would rather be choked. My body would prefer death {to these dreams}.",
  "16": "I hate my life; I do not want to live forever. Leave me alone because my days are so brief.",
  "17": "\"What is a mortal that you should make so much of him, that you should be concerned about him?",
  "18": "{What is he} that you should inspect him every morning and examine him every moment?",
  "19": "Why don't you stop looking at me long enough to let me swallow my spit?",
  "20": "If I sin, what can I {possibly} do to you since you insist on spying on people? Why do you make me your target? I've become a burden even to myself.",
  "21": "Why don't you forgive my disobedience and take away my sin? Soon I'll lie down in the dust. Then you will search for me, but I'll be gone!\""
