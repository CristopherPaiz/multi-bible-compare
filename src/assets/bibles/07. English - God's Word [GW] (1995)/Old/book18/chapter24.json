  "5": "Like wild donkeys in the desert, poor people go out to do their work, looking for food. The plains provide food for their children.",
  "6": "They harvest animal food in the field {to feed themselves}. They pick the leftover grapes in the wicked person's vineyard.",
  "7": "All night they lie naked without a covering from the cold.",
