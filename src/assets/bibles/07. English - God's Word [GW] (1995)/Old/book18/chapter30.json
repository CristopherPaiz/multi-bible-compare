  "1": "\"But now those who are younger than I am laugh at me. I didn't think their fathers were fit to sit with the dogs of my flock.",
  "2": "Of what use to me was the strength of their hands? Their strength is gone.",
  "3": "Shriveled up from need and hunger, they gnaw at the dry and barren ground during the night.",
  "4": "They pick saltwort from the underbrush, and the roots of the broom plant are their food.",
  "5": "They are driven from the community. People shout at them in the same way they shout at thieves.",
  "6": "They have to live in dry riverbeds, in holes in the ground, and among rocks.",
  "7": "They howl in bushes and huddle together under thornbushes.",
  "8": "Godless fools and worthless people are forced out of the land with whips.",
  "9": "\"And now they make fun of me with songs. I have become a joke to them.",
  "10": "Since they consider me disgusting, they keep their distance from me and don't hesitate to spit in my face.",
  "11": "Because God has untied my cord and has made me suffer, they are no longer restrained in my presence.",
  "12": "They have attacked me on my right side like a mob. They trip my feet and then prepare ways to destroy me.",
  "13": "Yes, they remove all traces of my path in order to destroy me. No one is there to help me against them.",
  "14": "They come through a wide hole {in the wall}. They crawl through the ruins.",

  "17": "At night God pierces my bones. My body doesn't rest.",
  "18": "With great strength he grabs my clothes. He seizes me by the collar of my robe.",
  "19": "He throws me into the dirt so that I become like dust and ashes.",
  "20": "\"I call to you for help, but you don't answer me. I stand up, but you just look at me.",
  "21": "You have begun to treat me cruelly. With your mighty hand you assault me.",
  "22": "You pick me up and let the wind carry me away. You toss me around with a storm.",

  "25": "Didn't I cry for the person whose days were difficult? Didn't my soul grieve for the poor?",
  "26": "When I waited for good, evil came. When I looked for light, darkness came.",
  "27": "My insides are churning and won't calm down. Days of misery are ahead of me.",
  "28": "I walk in the dark without the sun. I stand up in public and call for help.",
  "29": "I'm a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches.",
  "30": "My skin turns dark and peels. My body burns with fever.",
  "31": "So my lyre is used for mourning and my flute for loud weeping."
