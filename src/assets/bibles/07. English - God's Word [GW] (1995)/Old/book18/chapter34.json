  "1": "Elihu continued to speak {to Job and his friends},",
  "2": "\"Listen to my words, you wise men. Open your ears to me, you intelligent men.",
  "3": "The ear tests words like the tongue tastes food.",
  "4": "Let's decide for ourselves what is right and agree among ourselves as to what is good,",
  "5": "because Job has said, 'I'm righteous, but God has taken away my rights.",
  "6": "I'm considered a liar in spite of my rights. I've been wounded by a deadly arrow, though I haven't been disobedient.'",
  "7": "What person is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,",
  "8": "who travels with troublemakers and associates with evil people?",
  "9": "He says, 'It doesn't do any good to try to please God.'",
  "10": "\"You people who have understanding, listen to me. It is unthinkable that God would ever do evil or that the Almighty would ever do wicked things.",
  "11": "God will repay humanity for what it has done and will give each person what he deserves.",
  "12": "Certainly, God will never do anything evil, and the Almighty will never pervert justice.",
  "13": "Who put him in charge of the earth? Who appointed him to be over the whole world?",
  "14": "If he thought only of himself and withdrew his Spirit and his breath,",
  "15": "all living beings would die together, and humanity would return to dust.",
  "16": "\"If you understand, listen to this. Open your ears to my words!",
  "17": "Should anyone who hates justice be allowed to govern? Will you condemn the one who is righteous and mighty?",
  "18": "Should anyone {even} say to a king, 'You good-for-nothing scoundrel!' or to nobles, 'You wicked people!'",
  "19": "The one who is righteous and mighty does not grant special favors to princes or prefer important people over poor people because his hands made them all.",
  "20": "They die suddenly in the middle of the night. People have seizures and pass away. Mighty people are taken away but not by human hands.",
  "21": "God's eyes are on a person's ways. He sees all his steps.",
  "22": "There's no darkness or deep shadow where troublemakers can hide.",
  "23": "He doesn't have to set a time for a person in order to bring him to divine judgment.",
  "24": "He breaks mighty people into pieces without examining them and puts others in their places.",
  "25": "He knows what they do, so he overthrows them at night, and they're crushed.",
  "26": "In return for their evil, he strikes them in public,",
  "27": "because they turned away from following him and didn't consider any of his ways.",
  "28": "They forced the poor to cry out to him, and he hears the cry of those who suffer.",
  "29": "If he keeps quiet, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him whether it is a nation or a single person?",
  "30": "{He does this} so that godless people cannot rule and so that they cannot trap people.",
  "31": "\"But suppose such a person says to God, 'I am guilty, I will stop my immoral behavior.",
  "32": "Teach me what I cannot see. If I've done wrong, I won't do it again.'",
  "33": "Should God reward you on your own terms since you have rejected his? You must choose, not I. Tell me what you know. Speak!",
  "34": "\"People of understanding, the wise people who listen to me, will say,",
  "35": "'Job speaks without knowledge. His words show no insight.'",
  "36": "\"My Father, let Job be thoroughly tested for giving answers like wicked people do.",
  "37": "He adds disobedience to his sin. He claps his hands to insult us. He multiplies his words against God.\""
