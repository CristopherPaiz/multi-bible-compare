  "1": "\"Please, Job, listen to my words and consider everything I say.",
  "2": "I've opened my mouth. The words are on the tip of my tongue.",
  "3": "My words are straight from the heart, and I sincerely speak the knowledge that is on my lips.",
  "4": "\"God's Spirit has made me. The breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "Answer me if you can. Present your case to me, and take your stand.",
  "6": "Indeed, I stand in front of God as you do. I, too, was formed from a piece of clay.",
  "7": "You certainly don't need to be terrified of me. I won't put too much pressure on you.",
  "8": "\"But you spoke directly to me, and I listened to your words.",
  "9": "{You said,} 'I'm pureâ€”without any rebellious acts {against God}. I'm clean; I have no sin.",
  "10": "God is only looking for an excuse to attack me. He considers me his enemy.",
  "11": "He puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'",
  "12": "You aren't right about this! I've got an answer for you: God is greater than any mortal.",
  "13": "Why do you quarrel with him since he doesn't answer any questions?",
  "14": "\"God speaks in one way, even in two ways without people noticing it:",
  "15": "In a dream, a prophetic vision at night, when people fall into a deep sleep, when they sleep on their beds,",

  "17": "{He warns them} to turn away from doing {wrong} and to stop being arrogant.",
  "18": "He keeps their souls from the pit and their lives from crossing the River {of Death}.",
  "19": "In pain on their sickbeds, they are disciplined with endless aching in their bones",
  "20": "so that their whole being hates food and they lose their appetite for a delicious meal.",
  "21": "Their flesh becomes so thin that it can't be seen. Their bones, not seen before, will be exposed.",
  "22": "Their souls approach the pit. Their lives come close to those already dead.",
  "23": "\"If they have a messenger for them, a spokesman, one in a thousand, to tell people what is right for them,",
  "24": "then he will have pity on them and say, 'Free them from going into the pit. I have found a ransom.'",
  "25": "Then their flesh will become softer than a child's. They will go back to the days of their youth.",
  "26": "They will pray to God, who will be pleased with them. They will see God's face and shout for joy as he restores their righteousness.",
  "27": "Each one sings in front of other people and says, 'I sinned and did wrong instead of what was right, and it did me no good.",
  "28": "The messenger has freed my soul from going into the pit, and my life will see the light.'",
  "29": "Truly, God does all this two or three times with people",
  "30": "to turn their souls away from the pit and to enlighten them with the light of life.",
  "31": "\"Pay attention, Job! Listen to me! Keep quiet, and let me speak.",
  "32": "If you have a response, answer me. Speak, because I'd be happy if you were right.",
  "33": "If not, you listen to me. Keep quiet, and I'll teach you wisdom.\""
