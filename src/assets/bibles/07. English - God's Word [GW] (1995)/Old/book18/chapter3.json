  "1": "After all this, Job {finally} opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.",
  "2": "Job said,",
  "3": "\"Scratch out the day I was born and the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived!'",
  "4": "\"That day— let it be pitch-black. Let God above not {even} care about it. Let no light shine on it.",
  "5": "Let the darkness and long shadows claim it as their own. Let a dark cloud hang over it. Let the gloom terrify it.",
  "6": "\"That night— let the blackness take it away. Let it not be included in the days of the year or be numbered among the months.",
  "7": "Let that night be empty. Let no joyful singing be heard in it.",
  "8": "Let those who curse the day (those who know how to wake up Leviathan) curse that night.",
  "9": "Let its stars turn dark before dawn. Let it hope for light and receive none. Let it not see the first light of dawn",
  "10": "because it did not shut the doors of the womb {from which I came} or hide my eyes from trouble.",
  "11": "\"Why didn't I die as soon as I was born and breathe my last breath when I came out of the womb?",

  "13": "Instead of being alive, I would now be quietly lying down. I would now be sleeping peacefully.",
  "14": "I would be with the kings and the counselors of the world who built for themselves {what are now} ruins.",

  "18": "There the captives have no troubles at all. There they do not hear the shouting of the slave driver.",
  "19": "There {you find} both the unimportant and important people. There the slave is free from his master.",
  "20": "\"Why give light to one in misery and life to those who find it so bitter,",
  "21": "to those who long for death but it never comes— though they dig for it more than for buried treasure?",
  "22": "They are ecstatic, delighted to find the grave.",
  "23": "Why give light to those whose paths have been hidden, to those whom God has fenced in?",
  "24": "\"When my food is in front of me, I sigh. I pour out my groaning like water.",
  "25": "What I fear most overtakes me. What I dread happens to me.",
  "26": "I have no peace! I have no quiet! I have no rest! And trouble keeps coming!\""
