  "4": "my lips will not say anything wrong, and my tongue will not mumble anything deceitful.'",
  "5": "It's unthinkable for me to admit that you are right. Until I breathe my last breath, I will never give up my claim of integrity.",
  "6": "I cling to my righteousness and won't let go. My conscience won't accuse me as long as I live.",
  "7": "\"Let my enemy be {treated} like wicked people. Let anyone who attacks me be {treated} like unrighteous people.",

  "19": "He may go to bed rich, but he'll never be rich again. When he opens his eyes, nothing will be left.",
  "20": "Terrors overtake him like a flood. A windstorm snatches him away at night.",
  "21": "The east wind carries him away, and he's gone. It sweeps him from his place.",
  "22": "It hurls itself at him without mercy. He flees from its power.",
  "23": "It claps its hands over him. It whistles at him from his own place."
