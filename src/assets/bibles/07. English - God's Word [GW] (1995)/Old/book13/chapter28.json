  "1": "David held a meeting in Jerusalem for all the leaders of Israelâ€”the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the army units that served the king, the commanders of regiments and battalions, the officials in charge of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, the palace officials, the soldiers, and the fighting men.",
  "2": "David stood in front of them and said, \"Listen to me, my relatives and subjects. I had my heart set on building the temple where the ark of the Lord's promise could be placed. This temple would be a stool for our God's feet, and I have made preparations to build it.",
  "3": "But God told me, 'You must not build the temple for my name. You have fought wars and caused bloodshed.'",
  "4": "Yet, from my entire family the Lord God of Israel chose me to be king of Israel permanently. He had chosen the tribe of Judah to lead {Israel}. From the families of Judah he chose my father's family. From among my father's sons he was pleased to make me king of all Israel.",
  "5": "And of all my sons (the Lord has given me many sons) he chose my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the Lord's kingdom to rule Israel.",
  "6": "\"He told me, 'Your son Solomon will build my temple and my courtyards because I have chosen him to be my son. I will be his father.",
  "7": "I will establish his kingdom forever if he will remain determined to obey my commands and laws, as he is doing today.'",
  "8": "Now, {leaders, I order you} in the sight of Israel (the Lord's congregation) and as our God listens to dedicate your lives to doing everything the Lord your God has commanded. Then you will be able to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants.",
  "9": "\"And you, my son Solomon, learn to know your father's God. Serve the Lord wholeheartedly and willingly because he searches every heart and understands every thought {we have}. If you dedicate your life to serving him, he will accept you. But if you abandon him, he will reject you from then on.",
  "10": "So be careful, because the Lord has chosen you to build the temple as his holy place. Be strong, and do it.\"",
  "11": "Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the entrance hall and the temple, its storerooms, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the throne of mercy.",
  "12": "He gave him plans for the courtyards of the Lord's temple and for all the rooms around it. (These rooms served as treasuries for God's temple and the gifts dedicated to God.)",
  "13": "He determined the divisions of priests and Levites. He planned all the work done for worship in the Lord's temple. He designed all the utensils for worship in the Lord's temple.",
  "14": "{David specified} the weight of gold to be used for each of the utensils for worship,",
  "15": "the weight of the gold lamp stands and their gold lamps ({that is,} the weight of gold for each lamp stand and its lamps), the weight of silver for each silver lamp stand and its lamps (according to the use of each lamp stand for worship),",
  "16": "the weight of gold for each table with the rows of bread, and the silver for the silver tables,",
  "17": "the pure gold for the forks, bowls, and pitchers, the weight of each gold bowl, the weight of each silver bowl,",
  "18": "and the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave Solomon the plans for the chariot, that is, the gold angels with their wings spread to cover the ark of the Lord's promise.",
  "19": "{David said,} \"All this was written for me by the Lord's hand. He made all the details of the plan clear to me.\"",
  "20": "David also told his son Solomon, \"Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Don't be afraid or terrified. The Lord God, my God, will be with you. He will not abandon you before all the work on the Lord's temple is finished.",
  "21": "Here are also the divisions of the priests and Levites for every type of worship in God's temple. You have with you every skilled worker to do all the work. In addition, all the leaders and people are at your command.\""
