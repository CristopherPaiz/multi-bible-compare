  "3": "All your leaders fled together and were captured without their bows and arrows. All those who were found were taken prisoner before any of them could get far away.",
  "4": "That is why I say, \"Turn away from me so that I can cry bitterly. Don't try to comfort me because of the destruction brought on my people.\"",

  "10": "You will count the houses in Jerusalem. You will tear down those houses in order to fortify the walls.",
  "11": "You will build a reservoir between the two walls to hold the water of the Old Pool. You didn't look to Jerusalem's maker. You didn't see the one who formed it long ago.",
  "12": "On that day the Almighty Lord of Armies will call for crying and for mourning, for shaving your heads and for wearing sackcloth.",
  "13": "Instead, you will rejoice, celebrate, slaughter cattle, and butcher sheep. You will eat meat, drink wine, and say, \"Let's eat and drink because tomorrow we're going to die.\"",
  "14": "The Lord of Armies revealed this to me: \"Certainly, this wrong will not be forgiven even when you die,\" says the Almighty Lord of Armies.",
  "15": "This is what the Almighty Lord of Armies says: Go to Shebna, the man in charge of the palace, and say {to him},",
  "16": "\"What are you doing here? What right do you have to dig a tomb for yourself? What right do you have to cut it out in a prominent place? What right do you have to carve out a resting place for yourself in the rock?",
  "17": "Look, mighty man! The Lord will throw you out. He will grab you.",
  "18": "He will wrap you up tightly like a turban. He will throw you far away into another land. There you will die. There your splendid chariots will remain. There you will become a disgrace to your master's household.",
  "19": "\"I will remove you from your office and do away with your position.",

  "25": "The Lord of Armies declares, \"On that day the peg which I firmly fastened in place will be removed. It will be cut off and will fall, and everything hanging on it will be destroyed.\" The Lord has spoken."
