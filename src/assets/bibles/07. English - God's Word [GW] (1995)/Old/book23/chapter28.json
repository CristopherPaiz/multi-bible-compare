  "7": "Priests and prophets stagger from wine and wobble from too much liquor. They stagger from too much liquor and become confused from too much wine. They wobble because of their liquor. They stagger when they see visions. They swerve as they judge.",

  "13": "The Lord speaks utter nonsense to them. That is why they will fall backwards. That is why they will be hurt, trapped, and captured.",
  "14": "So hear the word of the Lord, you foolish talkers who rule the people in Jerusalem.",
  "15": "You say, \"We made a treaty with death and an agreement with the grave. When the overwhelming disaster passes by, it won't matter to us, because we have taken refuge in our lies, and falsehood is our hiding place.\"",

  "17": "I will make justice a measuring line and righteousness a plumb line. Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and floodwaters will wash away your hiding place.",
  "18": "Your treaty with death will be wiped away. Your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming disaster passes by, you will be trampled by it.",
  "19": "Each time it passes by it will take you. It will pass by morning after morning, during the day and during the night. Understanding this message brings only terror.",
  "20": "The bed is too short to stretch out on. The blanket is too narrow to serve as a cover.",
  "21": "The Lord will rise as he did on Mount Perazim. He will wake up as he did in Gibeon Valley. He will do his work, his unexpected work, and perform his deeds, his mysterious deeds.",
