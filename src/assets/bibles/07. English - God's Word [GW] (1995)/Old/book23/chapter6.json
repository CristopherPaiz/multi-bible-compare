  "1": "In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. The bottom of his robe filled the temple.",
  "2": "Angels were standing above him. Each had six wings: With two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.",
  "3": "They called to each other and said, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Armies! The whole earth is filled with his glory.\"",
  "4": "Their voices shook the foundations of the doorposts, and the temple filled with smoke.",
  "5": "So I said, \"Oh, no! I'm doomed. Every word that passes through my lips is sinful. I live among people with sinful lips. I have seen the king, the Lord of Armies!\"",
  "6": "Then one of the angels flew to me. In his hand was a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs.",
  "7": "He touched my mouth with it and said, \"This has touched your lips. Your guilt has been taken away, and your sin has been forgiven.\"",
  "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \"Whom will I send? Who will go for us?\" I said, \"Here I am. Send me!\"",
  "9": "And he said, \"Go and tell these people, 'No matter how closely you listen, you'll never understand. No matter how closely you look, you'll never see.'",
  "10": "Make these people close-minded. Plug their ears. Shut their eyes. Otherwise, they may see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their minds, and return and be healed.\"",
  "11": "I asked, \"How long, O Lord?\" And he replied, \"Until the cities lie in ruins with no one living in them, the houses have no people, and the land is completely desolate.",
  "12": "The Lord will send his people far away, and a large area in the middle of the land will be abandoned.",
  "13": "Even if one out of ten people is left in it, the land will be burned again. When a sacred oak or an oak is cut down, a stump is left. The holy seed will be the land's stump.\""
