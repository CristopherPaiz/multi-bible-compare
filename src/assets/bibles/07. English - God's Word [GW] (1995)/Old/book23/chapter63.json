  "2": "Why are your clothes red and your garments like those who trample grapes in a winepress?",
  "3": "\"I have trampled alone in the winepress. No one was with me. In my anger I trampled on people. In my wrath I stomped on them. Their blood splattered my clothes so all my clothing has been stained.",

  "13": "Where is the one who led them through the deep water? Like horses in the wilderness, they didn't stumble.",
  "14": "Like animals going down into a valley, they were given rest by the Lord's Spirit. In this way you guided your people to make an honored name for yourself.",

  "19": "We have become like those whom you never ruled, like those who are not called by your name."
