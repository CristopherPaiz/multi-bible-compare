  "1": "Righteous people die, and no one cares. Loyal people are taken away, and no one understands. Righteous people are spared when evil comes.",
  "2": "When peace comes, everyone who has lived honestly will rest on his own bed.",
  "3": "But youâ€”come here, you children of witches, you descendants of adulterers and prostitutes!",
  "4": "Whom are you making fun of? Whom are you making a face at? Whom are you sticking out your tongue at? Aren't you rebellious children, descendants of liars?",
  "5": "You burn with lust under oak trees and under every large tree. You slaughter children in the valleys and under the cracks in the rocks.",
  "6": "Your idols are among the smooth stones in the ravine. They are your destiny. You have given them wine offerings and sacrificed grain offerings to them. Do you think I am pleased with all this?",
  "7": "You've made your bed on a high and lofty mountain. You've gone to offer sacrifices there.",
  "8": "You've set up your idols beside doors and doorposts. You've uncovered yourself to the idols. You've distanced yourself from me. You've made your bed with them. You've made a deal with those you have pleasure with in bed. You've seen them naked.",
  "9": "You've journeyed to the king with perfumed oils and put on plenty of perfume. You've sent your ambassadors far away and sent them down to Sheol.",
  "10": "You've tired yourself out with many journeys. You didn't think that it was hopeless. You've found renewed strength, so you didn't faint.",
  "11": "Whom did you dread and fear so much that you lied to me? You haven't remembered me or cared about me. I've been silent for a long time. Is that why you don't fear me?",
  "12": "I'll tell you about your righteous ways and what you have done, but they won't help you.",
  "13": "When you cry for help, let your collection of idols save you. A wind will carry them all away. A breath will take them away. But whoever trusts me will possess the land and inherit my holy mountain.",
  "14": "It will be said: \"Build a road! Build a road! Prepare the way! Remove every obstacle in the way of my people!\"",
  "15": "The High and Lofty One lives forever, and his name is holy. This is what he says: I live in a high and holy place. But I am with those who are crushed and humble. I will renew the spirit of those who are humble and the courage of those who are crushed.",
  "16": "I will not accuse you forever. I will not be angry with you forever. Otherwise, the spirits, the lives of those I've made, would grow faint in my presence.",
  "17": "I was angry because of their sinful greed, so I punished them, hid {from them}, and remained angry. But they continued to be sinful.",
  "18": "I've seen their {sinful} ways, but I'll heal them. I'll guide them and give them rest. I'll comfort them and their mourners.",
  "19": "I'll create praise on their lips: \"Perfect peace to those both far and near.\" \"I'll heal them,\" says the Lord.",
  "20": "But the wicked are like the churning sea. It isn't quiet, and its water throws up mud and slime.",
  "21": "\"There is no peace for the wicked,\" says my God."
