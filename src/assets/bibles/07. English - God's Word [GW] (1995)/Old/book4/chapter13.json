  "19": "Is the land they live in good or bad? Do their cities have walls around them or not?",
  "20": "Is the soil rich or poor? Does the land have trees or not? Do your best to bring back some fruit from the land.\" (It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.)",
  "21": "So the men explored the land from the Desert of Zin to the border of Hamath.",
