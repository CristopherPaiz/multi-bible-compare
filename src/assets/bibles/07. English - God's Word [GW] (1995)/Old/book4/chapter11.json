  "7": "(Manna was {small} like coriander seeds and looked like resin.",
  "8": "The people would go around and gather it, then grind it in a handmill or crush it in a mortar. They would cook it in a pot or make round loaves of bread out of it. It tasted like rich pastry made with olive oil.",

  "11": "So he asked, \"Lord, why have you brought me this trouble? How have I displeased you that you put the burden of all these people on me?",
  "12": "Am I their mother? Did I give birth to them? Are you really asking me to carry them in my arms—as a nurse carries a baby—all the way to the land you promised their ancestors with an oath?",

  "18": "Tell the people to get ready for tomorrow. They must be set apart as holy. Then they will eat meat. I, the Lord, heard them crying and saying, 'If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!' So I will give them meat.",
  "19": "They won't eat it just for one or two days, or five, or ten, or twenty days,",
  "20": "but for a whole month, until it comes out of their ears and they're sick of it. This is because they rejected the Lord who is here among them and cried in front of him, asking, 'Why did we ever leave Egypt?' \"",
