  "3": "They will work for you, doing whatever work is necessary for the whole tent. But they must not come near the altar or the furnishings in the holy place, or they will die, and you will die, too.",
  "4": "They will join you and do whatever work is necessary for the tent of meeting, including all the maintenance work for the tent. But no one else may come near you.",

  "7": "Only you and your sons may do the work of priests—everything done at the altar and under the canopy. This is my gift to you: You may serve me as priests. Anyone else who comes near {the holy place to do this work} must die.\"",

  "11": "\"The contributions that come as gifts taken from the offerings presented by the Israelites are also yours. I am giving these to you, your sons, and your daughters. They will always be yours. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat them.",
  "12": "\"I am also giving you the first of the produce they give the Lord: the best of all the olive oil and the best of the new wine and fresh grain.",
  "13": "The first of all produce harvested in their land that they bring to the Lord is yours. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat it.",
