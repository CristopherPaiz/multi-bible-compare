  "5": "and criticized God and Moses. They said, \"Why did you make us leave Egyptâ€”just to let us die in the desert? There's no bread or water, and we can't stand this awful food!\"",
  "6": "So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people. They bit the people, and many of the Israelites died.",

  "20": "and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where Mount Pisgah overlooks Jeshimon.",
  "21": "Then Israel sent messengers to say to King Sihon of the Amorites,",
  "22": "\"Let us go through your country. We won't go through any of your fields or vineyards or drink any of the water from your wells. We'll stay on the king's highway until we've passed through your territory.\"",

  "29": "How horrible it is for you, Moab! You are destroyed, you people of the god Chemosh. Chemosh let his sons become refugees and he let his daughters become prisoners of King Sihon of the Amorites.",
