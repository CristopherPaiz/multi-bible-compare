  "1": "\"Sound the alarm on the ram's horn. The enemy swoops down on the Lord's temple like an eagle. The people of Israel have rejected my promise and rebelled against my teachings.",
  "2": "They cry out to me, 'We acknowledge you as our God.'",
  "3": "However, they have rejected what is good. The enemy will persecute them.",
  "4": "\"They chose their own kings, kings I didn't approve. They chose their own princes, princes I didn't know. They chose to make idols with their own silver and gold. Because of this, they will be destroyed.",
  "5": "Get rid of your calf-shaped idol, Samaria. My anger burns against these people. How long will they remain unclean?",
  "6": "Samaria's calf-shaped idol was made in Israel. Skilled workers made it. It is not a god. It will be smashed to pieces.",

  "12": "I have written many things for them in my teachings, but they consider these things strange and foreign.",
  "13": "They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of sacrifices, but I, the Lord, do not accept these sacrifices. Now I will remember their wickedness and punish them because of their sins. They will go back to Egypt.",
  "14": "The people of Israel have built palaces, and they have forgotten their maker. The people of Judah have built many fortified cities. I will send a fire on their cities and burn down their palaces.\""
