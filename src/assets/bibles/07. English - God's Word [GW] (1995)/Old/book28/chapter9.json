  "1": "Israel, don't rejoice. Don't celebrate as other nations do. You have been unfaithful to your God. You have sold sex on every threshing floor.",
  "2": "There won't be enough grain to feed people. There won't be enough wine to go around.",
  "3": "The people of Ephraim won't stay in the Lord's land. They will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.",
  "4": "They won't pour wine offerings to the Lord, and their sacrifices won't please him. Their sacrifices will be like the food that mourners eat. All who eat this food will be unclean. Their food will only satisfy their hunger. It will not be brought {as an offering} to the Lord's temple.",
  "5": "What will they do on the day of an appointed festival or on the Lord's festival days?",
  "6": "Even if they escape without being destroyed, Egypt will capture them and Memphis will bury them. Weeds will grow over their silver treasures. Thorns will grow over their tents.",
  "7": "The time for them to be punished will come. The time for them to pay for their sins will come. {When this happens,} Israel will know it. {They think that} prophets are fools and that spiritual people are crazy. They have sinned a lot, and they are very hostile.",
  "8": "Prophets are God's watchmen over Ephraim. Yet, traps are set on every prophet's path, and people are hostile in the temple of their God.",
  "9": "People have deeply corrupted themselves as they once did at Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them because of their sins.",
  "10": "{The Lord said,} \"When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert. When I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the first figs of the harvest. But they went to Baal Peor and worshiped shameful idols. They became as disgusting as the things they worshiped.",
  "11": "\"Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no more pregnancies, births, or babies.",
  "12": "Even if they bring up children, I will take those children away before they grow up. Yes, how horrible it will be for them when I leave them.",
  "13": "I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place. But the people of Ephraim will bring out their children to be killed.\"",
  "14": "Lord, give them what they deserve. Make the women miscarry, or else make them unable to nurse their babies.",
  "15": "\"All Ephraim's wickedness began in Gilgal; I hated the people there. I will force them out of my temple because of their wickedness, and I won't love them anymore. All their officials are rebellious.",
  "16": "\"The people of Ephraim are like sick plants. Their roots are dried up. They have no fruit. Even if they were to have children, I would kill their dear children.\"",
  "17": "My God will reject them because they refused to listen to him. They will wander among the nations."
