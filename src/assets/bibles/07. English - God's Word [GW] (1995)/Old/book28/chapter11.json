  "6": "War will sweep through their cities, demolish their city gates, and put an end to their plans.",
  "7": "My people are determined to turn away from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will not pardon them.",
  "8": "\"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboim? I have changed my mind. I am deeply moved.",

  "10": "\"My people will follow me when I roar like a lion. When I roar, my children will come trembling from the west.",
