  "1": "There is a tragedy that I have seen under the sun. It is a terrible one for mortals.",
  "2": "God gives one person riches, wealth, and honor so that he doesn't lack anything he wants. Yet, God doesn't give him the power to enjoy any of them. Instead, a stranger enjoys them. This is pointless and is a painful tragedy.",
  "3": "Suppose a rich person wasn't satisfied with good things {while he was alive} and didn't even get an honorable burial {after he died}. Suppose he had a hundred children and lived for many years. No matter how long he would have lived, it {still} would have been better for him to have been born dead.",

  "8": "What advantage does a wise person have over a fool? What advantage does a poor person have in knowing how to face life?",

  "11": "The more words there are, the more pointless they become. What advantage do mortals gain from this?",
  "12": "Who knows what may be good for mortals while they are alive, during the brief, pointless days they live? Mortals pass by like a shadow. Who will tell them about their future under the sun?"
