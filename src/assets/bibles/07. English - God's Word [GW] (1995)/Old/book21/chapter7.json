  "1": "A good name is better than expensive perfume, and the day you die is better than the day you're born.",
  "2": "It is better to go to a funeral than to a banquet because that is where everyone will end up. Everyone who is alive should take this to heart!",
  "3": "Sorrow is better than laughter because, in spite of a sad face, the heart can be joyful.",
  "4": "The minds of wise people think about funerals, but the minds of fools think about banquets.",
  "5": "It is better to listen to wise people who reprimand you than to fools who sing your praises.",
  "6": "The laughter of a fool is like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot. Even this is pointless.",
  "7": "Oppression can turn a wise person into a fool, and a bribe can corrupt the mind.",
  "8": "The end of something is better than its beginning. It is better to be patient than arrogant.",
  "9": "Don't be quick to get angry, because anger is typical of fools.",
  "10": "Don't ask, \"Why were things better in the old days than they are now?\" It isn't wisdom that leads you to ask this!",
  "11": "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. It is an advantage to everyone who sees the sun.",
  "12": "Wisdom protects us just as money protects us, but the advantage of wisdom is that it gives life to those who have it.",
  "13": "Consider what God has done! Who can straighten what God has bent?",
  "14": "When times are good, be happy. But when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one time as well as the other so that mortals cannot predict their future.",
  "15": "I have seen it all in my pointless life: Righteous people die in spite of being righteous. Wicked people go on living in spite of being wicked.",
  "16": "Don't be too virtuous, and don't be too wise. Why make yourself miserable?",
  "17": "Don't be too wicked, and don't be a fool. Why should you die before your time is up?",
  "18": "It's good to hold on to the one and not let go of the other, because the one who fears God will be able to avoid both extremes.",

  "23": "I used wisdom to test all of this. I said, \"I want to be wise, but it is out of my reach.\"",
  "24": "Whatever wisdom may be, it is out of reach. It is deep, very deep. Who can find out what it is?",
  "25": "I turned my attention to study, to explore, and to seek out wisdom and the reason for things. I learned that wickedness is stupid and foolishness is madness.",
  "26": "I find that a woman whose thoughts are {like} traps and snares is more bitter than death itself. Even her hands are {like} chains. Whoever pleases God will escape her, but she will catch whoever continues to sin.",
  "27": "The spokesman said, \"This is what I've found: I added one thing to another in order to find a reason for things.",
  "28": "I am still seeking a reason for things, but have not found any. I found one man out of a thousand who had it, but out of all these I didn't find one woman.",
  "29": "I have found only this: God made people decent, but they looked for many ways {to avoid being decent}.\""
