  "4": "Then he asked Jehoshaphat, \"Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth in Gilead?\" Jehoshaphat told the king of Israel, \"I will do what you do. My troops will do what your troops do. My horses will do what your horses do.\"",
  "5": "Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"But first, find out what the word of the Lord is {in this matter}.\"",
  "6": "So the king of Israel called 400 prophets together. He asked them, \"Should I go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?\" \"Go,\" they said. \"The Lord will hand over Ramoth to you.\"",
  "7": "But Jehoshaphat asked, \"Isn't there a prophet of the Lord whom we could ask?\"",

  "9": "The king of Israel called for an officer and said, \"Quick! {Get} Micaiah, son of Imlah!\"",

  "11": "Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said, \"This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will push the Arameans to their destruction.\"",
  "12": "All the other prophets made the same prophecy. They said, \"Attack Ramoth in Gilead, and you will win. The Lord will hand it over to you.\"",
  "13": "The messenger who went to call Micaiah told him, \"The prophets have all told the king the same good message. Make your message agree with their message. Say something good.\"",

  "37": "When the king was dead, he was brought to Samaria to be buried.",
  "38": "His chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria, where the prostitutes bathed. The dogs licked up his blood, as the Lord had predicted.",
  "39": "Isn't everything else about Ahab—everything he did, the ivory palace he built, and all the cities he fortified—written in the official records of the kings of Israel?",
