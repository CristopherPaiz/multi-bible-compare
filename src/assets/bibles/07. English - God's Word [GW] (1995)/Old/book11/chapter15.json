  "3": "He followed the sinful example his father had set and wasn't committed to the Lord his God as his ancestor David had been.",
  "4": "But for David's sake the Lord his God made Abijam a lamp in Jerusalem. He appointed David's descendant to rule after him and protected Jerusalem.",

  "6": "There was war between Abijam and Rehoboam throughout their lives.",

  "12": "He forced the male temple prostitutes out of the land and got rid of the idols his father had made.",
  "13": "He also removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother because she made a statue of the repulsive goddess Asherah. Asa cut the statue down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.",
  "14": "Although the illegal worship sites were not torn down, Asa remained committed to the Lord his entire life.",
  "15": "He brought into the Lord's temple the silver, the gold, and the utensils he and his father had set apart as holy.",
  "16": "There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel as long as they lived.",
  "17": "King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah to keep anyone from going to or coming from King Asa of Judah.",
  "18": "Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Lord's temple and the royal palace and turned them over to his officials. King Asa sent them to Damascus to Aram's King Benhadad, son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion.",
  "19": "He said, \"There's a treaty between you and me {as} there was between your father and my father. I'm sending you a present of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone.\"",

  "21": "When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying Ramah and lived in Tirzah.",

  "28": "The assassination happened in Asa's third year as king of Judah. Baasha succeeded Nadab as king of Israel.",
  "29": "As soon as he was king, he killed everyone else in Jeroboam's family. He did not spare a soul, as the Lord had spoken through his servant Ahijah from Shiloh.",
