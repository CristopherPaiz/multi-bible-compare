  "31": "Each had a 1 1/2-foot-deep opening in the center to the circular frame on top. The opening was round, formed like a pedestal, and was two feet {wide}. Around the opening there were engravings. But the panels were square, not round.",
  "32": "The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles were attached to the stand. Each wheel was two feet high.",
  "33": "The wheels were made like chariot wheels. The axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all cast metal.",

  "43": "10 stands and 10 basins on the stands,",
