  "12": "Then Solomon said, \"The Lord said he would live in a dark cloud.",
  "13": "I certainly have built you a high temple, a home for you to live in permanently.\"",
  "14": "Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel while they were standing.",
  "15": "\"Thanks be to the Lord God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David; with his hand he carried it out. He said,",
  "16": "'Ever since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I didn't choose any city in any of the tribes of Israel as a place to build a temple for my name. But now I've chosen David to rule my people Israel.'",
  "17": "\"My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel.",
  "18": "However, the Lord said to my father David, 'Since you had your heart set on building a temple for my name, your intentions were good.",

  "27": "\"Does God really live on earth? If heaven itself, the highest heaven, cannot hold you, then how can this temple that I have built?",
  "28": "Nevertheless, my Lord God, please pay attention to my prayer for mercy. Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you today.",
  "29": "Night and day may your eyes be on this temple, the place about which you said, 'My name will be there.' Listen to me as I pray toward this place.",
  "30": "Hear the plea for mercy that your people Israel and I pray toward this place. Hear us {when we pray} to heaven, the place where you live. Hear and forgive.",
  "31": "\"If anyone sins against another person and is required to take an oath and comes to take the oath in front of your altar in this temple,",
  "32": "then hear {that person} in heaven, take action, and make a decision. Condemn the guilty person with the proper punishment, but declare the innocent person innocent.",
  "33": "\"An enemy may defeat your people Israel because they have sinned against you. But when your people turn to you, praise your name, pray, and plead with you in this temple,",
  "34": "then hear {them} in heaven, forgive the sins of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land that you gave to their ancestors.",
  "35": "\"When the sky is shut and there's no rain because they are sinning against you, and they pray toward this place, praise your name, and turn away from their sin because you made them suffer,",
  "36": "then hear {them} in heaven. Forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the proper way to live. Then send rain on the land, which you gave to your people as an inheritance.",
  "37": "\"There may be famine in the land. Plant diseases, heat waves, funguses, locusts, or grasshoppers may destroy crops. Enemies may blockade Israel's city gates. During every plague or sickness",

  "40": "Then, as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors, they will fear you.",
  "41": "\"People will hear about your great name, mighty hand, and powerful arm. So when people who are not Israelites come from distant countries because of your name",
  "42": "to pray facing this temple,",

  "46": "\"They may sin against you. (No one is sinless.) You may become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy who takes them to {another} country as captives, {whether it is} far or near.",
  "47": "If they come to their senses, are sorry for what they've done, and plead with you in the land where they are captives, saying, 'We have sinned. We have done wrong. We have been wicked,'",
  "48": "if they change their attitude toward you in the land of their enemies where they are captives, if they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors, and the city you have chosen, and the temple I have built for your name,",
  "49": "then in heaven, the place where you live, hear their prayer for mercy. Do what is right for them.",
  "50": "Forgive your people, who have sinned against you. {Forgive} all their wrongs when they rebelled against you, and cause those who captured them to have mercy on them",
  "51": "because they are your own people whom you brought out of Egypt from the middle of an iron smelter.",
  "52": "\"May your eyes always see my plea and your people Israel's plea so that you will listen to them whenever they call on you.",
  "53": "After all, you, Lord God, set them apart from all the people of the world to be your own as you promised through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt.\"",
  "54": "When Solomon finished praying this prayer for mercy to the Lord, he stood in front of the Lord's altar, where he had been kneeling with his hands stretched out toward heaven.",
  "55": "Then he stood and in a loud voice blessed the entire assembly of Israel,",
  "56": "\"Thanks be to the Lord! He has given his people Israel rest, as he had promised. None of the good promises he made through his servant Moses has failed to come true.",

  "58": "May he bend our hearts toward him. Then we will follow him and keep his commands, laws, and rules, which he commanded our ancestors {to keep}.",
  "59": "May these words which I have prayed to the Lord be near the Lord our God day and night. Then he will give me and his people Israel justice every day as it is needed.",
  "60": "In this way all the people of the world will know that the Lord is God and there is no other {god}.",
  "61": "May your hearts be committed to the Lord our God. Then you will live by his laws and keep his commands as you have today.\"",
  "62": "Then the king and all Israel offered sacrifices to the Lord.",
  "63": "Solomon sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings to the Lord. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the Lord's temple.",
  "64": "On that day the king designated the courtyard in front of the Lord's temple as a holy place. He sacrificed the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat from the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar in front of the Lord was too small to hold all of them.",
  "65": "At that time Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival {of Booths}. A large crowd had come from {the territory between} the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt to be near the Lord our God for seven days.",
  "66": "On the eighth day he dismissed the people. They blessed the king and went to their tents. They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings the Lord had given his servant David and his people Israel."
