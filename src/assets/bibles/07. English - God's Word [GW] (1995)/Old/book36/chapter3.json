  "6": "\"I will cut off the nations. Their towers will be destroyed. I will demolish their streets. No one will walk through them. Their cities will be completely destroyed. Not a single person will be left. No one will be living there.",

  "18": "\"I will gather those among you who are troubled because of the festivals. They bear a burden of disgrace.",
  "19": "At that time I will deal with all who have overpowered you. I will rescue those who are lame. I will gather those who have been scattered. I will make them praised and famous in all the world, though they had been ashamed.",
