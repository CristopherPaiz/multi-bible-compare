  "1": "For the choir director; a psalm by David. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky displays what his hands have made.",
  "2": "One day tells a story to the next. One night shares knowledge with the next",
  "3": "without talking, without words, without their voices being heard.",
  "4": "{Yet,} their sound has gone out into the entire world, their message to the ends of the earth. He has set up a tent in the heavens for the sun,",
  "5": "which comes out of its chamber like a bridegroom. Like a champion, it is eager to run its course.",
  "6": "It rises from one end of the heavens. It circles around to the other. Nothing is hidden from its heat.",
  "7": "The teachings of the Lord are perfect. They renew the soul. The testimony of the Lord is dependable. It makes gullible people wise.",
  "8": "The instructions of the Lord are correct. They make the heart rejoice. The command of the Lord is radiant. It makes the eyes shine.",
  "9": "The fear of the Lord is pure. It endures forever. The decisions of the Lord are true. They are completely fair.",
  "10": "They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even the drippings from a honeycomb.",
  "11": "As your servant I am warned by them. There is a great reward in following them.",
  "12": "Who can notice every mistake? Forgive my hidden faults.",
  "13": "Keep me from sinning. Do not let anyone gain control over me. Then I will be blameless, and I will be free from any great offense.",
  "14": "May the words from my mouth and the thoughts from my heart be acceptable to you, O Lord, my rock and my defender."
