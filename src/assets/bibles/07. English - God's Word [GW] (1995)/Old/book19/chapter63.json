  "1": "A psalm by David when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, you are my God. At dawn I search for you. My soul thirsts for you. My body longs for you in a dry, parched land where there is no water.",
  "2": "So I look for you in the holy place to see your power and your glory.",
  "3": "My lips will praise you because your mercy is better than life {itself}.",
  "4": "So I will thank you as long as I live. I will lift up my hands {to pray} in your name.",
  "5": "You satisfy my soul with the richest foods. My mouth will sing {your} praise with joyful lips.",
  "6": "As I lie on my bed, I remember you. Through the long hours of the night, I think about you.",
  "7": "You have been my help. In the shadow of your wings, I sing joyfully.",
  "8": "My soul clings to you. Your right hand supports me.",
  "9": "But those who try to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth.",
  "10": "They will be cut down by swords. Their dead bodies will be left as food for jackals.",
  "11": "But the king will find joy in God. Everyone who takes an oath by God will brag, but the mouths of liars will be shut."
