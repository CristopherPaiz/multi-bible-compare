  "1": "For the choir director; a psalm by David. O Lord, you have examined me, and you know me.",
  "2": "You alone know when I sit down and when I get up. You read my thoughts from far away.",
  "3": "You watch me when I travel and when I rest. You are familiar with all my ways.",
  "4": "Even before there is a {single} word on my tongue, you know all about it, Lord.",
  "5": "You are all around meâ€”in front of me and in back of me. You lay your hand on me.",
  "6": "Such knowledge is beyond my grasp. It is so high I cannot reach it.",
  "7": "Where can I go {to get away} from your Spirit? Where can I run {to get away} from you?",
  "8": "If I go up to heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in hell, you are there.",
  "9": "If I climb upward on the rays of the morning sun {or} land on the most distant shore of the sea where the sun sets,",
  "10": "even there your hand would guide me and your right hand would hold on to me.",

  "13": "You alone created my inner being. You knitted me together inside my mother.",
  "14": "I will give thanks to you because I have been so amazingly and miraculously made. Your works are miraculous, and my soul is fully aware of this.",
  "15": "My bones were not hidden from you when I was being made in secret, when I was being skillfully woven in an underground workshop.",
  "16": "Your eyes saw me when I was only a fetus. Every day {of my life} was recorded in your book before one of them had taken place.",
  "17": "How precious are your thoughts concerning me, O God! How vast in number they are!",
  "18": "If I try to count them, there would be more of them than there are grains of sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.",
  "19": "I wish that you would kill wicked people, O God, and that bloodthirsty people would leave me alone.",
  "20": "They say wicked things about you. Your enemies misuse your name.",
  "21": "Shouldn't I hate those who hate you, O Lord? Shouldn't I be disgusted with those who attack you?",
  "22": "I hate them with all my heart. They have become my enemies.",
  "23": "Examine me, O God, and know my mind. Test me, and know my thoughts.",
  "24": "See whether I am on an evil path. Then lead me on the everlasting path."
