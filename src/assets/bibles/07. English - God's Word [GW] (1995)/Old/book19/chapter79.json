  "1": "A psalm by Asaph. O God, the nations have invaded the land that belongs to you. They have dishonored your holy temple. They have left Jerusalem in ruins.",
  "2": "They have given the dead bodies of your servants to the birds for food. They have given the flesh of your godly ones to the animals.",
  "3": "They have shed the blood of your people around Jerusalem as though it were water. There is no one to bury your people.",
  "4": "We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.",
  "5": "How long, O Lord? Will you remain angry forever? Will your fury continue to burn like fire?",
  "6": "Pour your fury on the nations that do not know you, on the kingdoms that have not called you.",
  "7": "They have devoured Jacob. They have destroyed his home.",
  "8": "Do not hold the crimes of our ancestors against us. Reach out to us soon with your compassion, because we are helpless.",
  "9": "Help us, O God, our savior, for the glory of your name. Rescue us, and forgive our sins for the honor of your name.",
  "10": "Why should the nations {be allowed to} say, \"Where is their God?\" Let us watch as the nations learn that there is punishment for shedding the blood of your servants.",
  "11": "Let the groans of prisoners come into your presence. With your powerful arm rescue those who are condemned to death.",
  "12": "Pay each one of our neighbors back with seven times the number of insults they used to insult you, O Lord.",
  "13": "Then we, your people, the flock in your pasture, will give thanks to you forever. We will praise you throughout every generation."
