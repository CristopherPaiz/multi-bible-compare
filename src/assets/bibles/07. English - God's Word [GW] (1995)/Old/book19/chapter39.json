  "1": "For the choir director; for Jeduthun; a psalm by David. I said, \"I will watch my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue. I will bridle my mouth while wicked people are in my presence.\"",
  "2": "I remained totally speechless. I kept silent, although it did me no good. While I was deep in thought, my pain grew worse.",
  "3": "My heart burned like a fire flaring up within me. Then I spoke with my tongue:",
  "4": "\"Teach me, O Lord, about the end of my life. Teach me about the number of days I have left so that I may know how temporary my life is.",
  "5": "Indeed, you have made the length of my days {only} a few inches. My life span is nothing compared to yours. Certainly, everyone alive is like a whisper in the wind. Selah",
  "6": "Each person who walks around is like a shadow. They are busy for no reason. They accumulate riches without knowing who will get them.\"",
  "7": "And now, Lord, what am I waiting for? My hope is in you!",
  "8": "Rescue me from all my rebellious acts. Do not disgrace me in front of godless fools.",
  "9": "I remained speechless. I did not open my mouth because you are the one who has done this.",
  "10": "Remove the sickness you laid upon me. My life is over because you struck me with your hand.",
  "11": "With stern warnings you discipline people for their crimes. Like a moth you eat away at what is dear to them. Certainly, everyone is like a whisper in the wind. Selah",
  "12": "Listen to my prayer, O Lord. Open your ear to my cry for help. Do not be deaf to my tears, for I am a foreign resident with you, a stranger like all my ancestors.",
  "13": "Look away from me so that I may smile again before I go away and am no more."
