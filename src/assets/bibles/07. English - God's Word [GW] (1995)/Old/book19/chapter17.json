  "1": "A prayer by David. Hear my plea for justice, O Lord. Pay attention to my cry. Open your ears to my prayer, {which comes} from lips free from deceit.",
  "2": "Let the verdict of my innocence come directly from you. Let your eyes observe what is fair.",
  "3": "You have probed my heart. You have confronted me at night. You have tested me like silver, but you found nothing wrong. I have determined that my mouth will not sin.",
  "4": "I have avoided cruelty because of your word. In spite of what others have done,",
  "5": "my steps have remained firmly in your paths. My feet have not slipped.",
  "6": "I have called on you because you answer me, O God. Turn your ear toward me. Hear what I have to say.",
  "7": "Reveal your miraculous deeds of mercy, O Savior of those who find refuge by your side from those who attack them.",
  "8": "Guard me as if I were the pupil in your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings.",
  "9": "Hide me from wicked people who violently attack me, from my deadly enemies who surround me.",

  "13": "Arise, O Lord; confront them! Bring them to their knees! With your sword rescue my life from wicked people.",
  "14": "With your power rescue me from mortals, O Lord, from mortals who enjoy their inheritance only in this life. You fill their bellies with your treasure. Their children are satisfied {with it}, and they leave what remains to their children.",
  "15": "I will see your face when I am declared innocent. When I wake up, I will be satisfied {with seeing} you."
