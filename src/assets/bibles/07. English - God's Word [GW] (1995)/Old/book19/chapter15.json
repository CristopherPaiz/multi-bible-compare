  "1": "A psalm by David. O Lord, who may stay in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?",
  "2": "The one who walks with integrity, does what is righteous, and speaks the truth within his heart.",
  "3": "The one who does not slander with his tongue, do evil to a friend, or bring disgrace on his neighbor.",
  "4": "The one who despises those rejected by God but honors those who fear the Lord. The one who makes a promise and does not break it, even though he is hurt by it.",
  "5": "The one who does not collect interest on a loan or take a bribe against an innocent person. Whoever does these things will never be shaken."
