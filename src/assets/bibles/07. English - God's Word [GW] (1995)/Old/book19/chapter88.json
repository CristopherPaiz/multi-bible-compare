  "1": "A song; a psalm by Korah's descendants; for the choir director; according to mahalath leannoth; a maskil by Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord God, my savior, I cry out to you during the day and at night.",
  "2": "Let my prayer come into your presence. Turn your ear to hear my cries.",
  "3": "My soul is filled with troubles, and my life comes closer to the grave.",
  "4": "I am numbered with those who go into the pit. I am like a man without any strength—",
  "5": "abandoned with the dead, like those who have been killed and lie in graves, like those whom you no longer remember, who are cut off from your power.",
  "6": "You have put me in the bottom of the pit—in deep, dark places.",
  "7": "Your rage lies heavily on me. You make all your waves pound on me. Selah",
  "8": "You have taken my friends far away from me. You made me disgusting to them. I'm shut in, and I can't get out.",

  "16": "Your burning anger has swept over me. Your terrors have destroyed me.",
  "17": "They swirl around me all day long like water. They surround me on all sides.",
  "18": "You have taken my loved ones and friends far away from me. Darkness is my only friend!"
