  "1": "A psalm by David. The Lord is my shepherd. I am never in need.",
  "2": "He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside peaceful waters.",
  "3": "He renews my soul. He guides me along the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.",
  "4": "Even though I walk through the dark valley of death, because you are with me, I fear no harm. Your rod and your staff give me courage.",
  "5": "You prepare a banquet for me while my enemies watch. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows.",
  "6": "Certainly, goodness and mercy will stay close to me all the days of my life, and I will remain in the Lord's house for days without end."
