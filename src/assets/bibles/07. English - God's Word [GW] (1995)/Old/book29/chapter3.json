  "1": "\"In those days and at that time, I will bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem.",
  "2": "I will gather all the nations. I will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. I will judge them there. They scattered the Israelites, the people who belong to me, among the nations. They divided my land.",
  "3": "They threw dice for my people. They traded boys for prostitutes. They sold girls so that they could buy wine to drink.",
  "4": "\"Now what do you have against me, Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will quickly pay you back for what you have done.",
  "5": "You took my silver and my gold. You brought my finest treasures to your temples.",

  "7": "I am going to make them leave the place where you sold them. I will pay you back for what you have done.",
  "8": "I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah. They will sell them to the people of Sheba, a nation that is far away.\" The Lord has spoken.",
  "9": "Announce this among the nations: Prepare yourselves for war. Wake up the warriors. Have all the warriors come near and attack.",
  "10": "Hammer your plowblades into swords and your pruning shears into spears. Weaklings should say that they are warriors.",
  "11": "Hurry from every direction, and gather there, all you nations. O Lord, bring your soldiers.",
  "12": "Wake up, you nations. Come to the valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.",
  "13": "Cut them down like grain. The harvest is ripe. Stomp on them as you would stomp on grapes. The winepress is full. The vats overflow. The nations are very wicked.",
  "14": "There are many, many people in the valley of decision. The day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.",
  "15": "The sun and the moon will turn dark. The stars will no longer shine.",
  "16": "The Lord will roar from Zion, and his voice will thunder from Jerusalem. The sky and the earth will shake. The Lord will be a refuge for his people. He will be a stronghold for the people of Israel.",

  "18": "On that day new wine will cover the mountains. Milk will flow on the hills. Water will flow in all the brooks of Judah. A spring will flow from the Lord's temple. It will water the valley of Shittim.",
  "19": "Egypt will become a wasteland. Edom will become a barren desert. This is because the nations were cruel to Judah. They murdered innocent people in their land.",
  "20": "People will always live in Judah. People will live in Jerusalem from now on.",
  "21": "I will punish those who murder.\" The Lord lives in Zion!"
