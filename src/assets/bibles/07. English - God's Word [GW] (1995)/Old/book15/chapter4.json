  "1": "When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people who returned from exile were building a temple for the Lord God of Israel,",
  "2": "they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families. They told them, \"We want to help you build because we worship the same God you worship. We have been sacrificing to him since the time of King Esarhaddon of Assyria, who brought us here.\"",
  "3": "But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of Israel's families told them, \"It isn't right for your people and our people to build a temple for our God together. We must build it alone for the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia ordered us to do.\"",
  "4": "Then the people of that region discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to continue building.",
  "5": "They bribed officials to keep the people of Judah from carrying out their plans throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius of Persia.",

  "11": "This is the copy of the letter they sent to him: To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the people west of the Euphrates:",
  "12": "Your Majesty, you should know that the Jews who came to us from you are now in Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are close to finishing the walls. The foundations are already in place.",
  "13": "You should also know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, the Jews will no longer pay taxes, fees, and tolls. Ultimately, this will hurt the king's income.",
  "14": "Now, because we are paid by your palace, it isn't right for us to watch something happen that will dishonor the king. So we are sending this letter to inform you",
  "15": "that you should search the official records of your predecessors. You will find in those official records that this city has been rebellious and has been a threat to kings and provinces. This city has a history of rebelliousness. That's why this city was destroyed.",
  "16": "We want the king to know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have nothing left {of your province} west of the Euphrates River.",

  "22": "Be careful not to neglect your duty in this matter. Why should I, the king, suffer any more harm?",
  "23": "Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and their group hurried to Jerusalem after hearing a copy of King Artaxerxes' letter. They forced the Jews to stop rebuilding.",
  "24": "Then the work on God's temple in Jerusalem was stopped. Nothing more was done until Darius' second year as king of Persia."
