  "35": "\"A sword will kill the Babylonians and everyone who lives in Babylon,\" declares the Lord. \"A sword will kill their officials and their wise men.",
  "36": "A sword will kill the false prophets. They will become fools. A sword will kill their soldiers and defeat them.",
  "37": "A sword will kill their horses, their chariots, and all the foreigners within their ranks. They will become women. A sword will destroy their treasures, and they will be looted.",
  "38": "A drought will diminish their water supply, and it will dry up. Babylon is a land of idols, statues that will go crazy with fear.",
  "39": "That is why desert animals will live with hyenas. Desert owls will also live there. It will no longer be inhabited or lived in for generations.",
