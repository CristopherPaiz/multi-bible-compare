  "2": "\"Listen to the word of the Lord, you officials, you people who come into these gates, and you, king of Judah, the one sitting on David's throne.",
  "3": "\"This is what the Lord says: Judge fairly, and do what is right. Rescue those who have been robbed from those who oppress them. Don't mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, and don't oppress them. Don't kill innocent people in this place.",
  "4": "If you do what I say, then the kings who sit on David's throne will ride through the gates of this palace in chariots and on horses along with their officials and their people.",

  "6": "\"This is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah: This palace is like Gilead to me, like the top of Lebanon. I will certainly turn it into a desert, into cities that no one lives in.",
  "7": "I will send people to destroy you. They will have their own weapons. They will cut down your finest cedar trees and throw them on a fire.",

  "13": "\"How horrible it will be for the person who builds his house dishonestly and his upper rooms through injustice. He makes his neighbors work for nothing and doesn't pay them for their work.",
  "14": "He says, 'I will build a large house for myself with big upper rooms.' He cuts out windows in it, panels the rooms with cedar, and paints them red.",
  "15": "Do you think you're a better king than others because you use more cedar? Your father ate and drank and did what is fair and right. Everything went well for him.",
  "16": "He defended the cause of the poor and needy. Everything went well for him. Isn't this what it means to know me?\" asks the Lord.",
  "17": "\"But your eyes and your mind are set on nothing but dishonest profits. You kill innocent people and violently oppress your people.\"",
  "18": "This is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim, son of Judah's King Josiah: People won't mourn for him and say, \"How horrible it is for my brother and sister!\" They won't mourn for him and say, \"How horrible it is for my master and his splendor!\"",

  "25": "I will hand you over to those who want to kill you, those you fearâ€”King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonians.",
