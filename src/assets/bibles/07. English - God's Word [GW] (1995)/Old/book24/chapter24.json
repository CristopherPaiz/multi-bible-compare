  "2": "One basket had very good figs, like figs that ripen first. The other basket had very bad figs. These figs were so bad that they couldn't be eaten.",
  "3": "Then the Lord asked me, \"What do you see, Jeremiah?\" I answered, \"Figs. Figs that are very good. I also see figs that are very bad, so bad that they can't be eaten.\"",

  "6": "I will watch over them for their own good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down. I will plant them and not uproot them.",
  "7": "I will give them the desire to know that I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will wholeheartedly come back to me.",
  "8": "\"But this is what the Lord says about the bad figs that are so bad that they can't be eaten. The Lord says, 'Like these bad figs, I will abandon King Zedekiah of Judah, his princes, the remaining few in Jerusalem who stayed behind in this land, and those who are living in Egypt.",
  "9": "I will make them a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth. They will be a disgrace and an example. They will become something ridiculed and cursed wherever I scatter them.",
  "10": "I will send wars, famines, and plagues until they disappear from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.' \""
