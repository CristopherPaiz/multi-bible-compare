  "4": "Today I'm removing the chains from your hands. If you would like to come with me to Babylon, come, and I'll look after you. But if you don't want to come with me to Babylon, don't come. The whole land is yours. Go wherever you want.",

  "10": "I'm going to live in Mizpah and represent you when the Babylonians come to us. Gather grapes, summer fruit, and olive oil, and put them in storage jars. Live in the cities you have taken over.\"",

  "15": "Then Johanan, Kareah's son, secretly asked Gedaliah at Mizpah, \"Let me kill Ishmael, Nethaniah's son. No one will know about it. Why should he kill you? All the Jews who have gathered around you would scatter. What is left of Judah would disappear.\"",
  "16": "Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, told Johanan, Kareah's son, \"Don't do that! What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.\""
