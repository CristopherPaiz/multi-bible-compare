  "3": "I went to the potter's house, and he was working there at his wheel.",
  "4": "Whenever a clay pot he was working on was ruined, he would rework it into a new clay pot the way he wanted to make it.",
  "5": "The Lord spoke his word to me. The Lord asked,",
  "6": "\"Nation of Israel, can't I do with you as this potter does with clay? Nation of Israel, you are like the clay in the potter's hands.",
  "7": "\"At one time I may threaten to tear up, break down, and destroy a nation or a kingdom.",
  "8": "But suppose the nation that I threatened turns away from doing wrong. Then I will change my plans about the disaster I planned to do to it.",

  "10": "But suppose that nation does what I consider evil and doesn't obey me. Then I will change my plans about the good that I promised to do to it.",

  "22": "Make them cry out from their homes when you suddenly send troops against them, because they dug a pit to catch me and hid snares for my feet.",
