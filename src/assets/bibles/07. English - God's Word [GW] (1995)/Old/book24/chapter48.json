  "1": "This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says about Moab: How horrible it will be for Nebo; it will be destroyed. Kiriathaim will be put to shame; it will be captured. Its stronghold will be put to shame and torn down.",
  "2": "People will no longer praise Moab. The people in Heshbon will plan Moab's destruction. \"Let's destroy that nation!\" You will be silenced, city of Madmen. Death will come after you.",
  "3": "People will cry out from Horonaim, \"Looting and great destruction!\"",
  "4": "Moab will be broken. Its little ones will cry out.",
  "5": "People go up the pass of Luhith, crying bitterly as they go. On the road down to Horonaim they have heard the distressful cry of destruction.",
  "6": "\"Run away! Run for your lives! Run like a wild donkey in the desert.\"",
  "7": "Since you trust the things you do and your treasures, you will be captured. Chemosh will go into captivity with all its priests and officials.",
  "8": "The destroyer will come to every city, and no city will escape. The valley will be destroyed, and the plain will be laid waste as the Lord has threatened.",
  "9": "Put salt on Moab. It will be destroyed. Its cities will become deserted ruins.",
  "10": "Cursed are those who neglect doing the Lord's work. Cursed are those who keep their swords from killing.",
  "11": "\"Moab has lived securely ever since it was young. Its people are like wine left to settle in a jar. They aren't poured from one jar to another. They haven't gone into captivity. That is why its flavor has remained the same, and its aroma hasn't changed.",
  "12": "That is why the days are coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when I will send people to pour Moab out of its jars and to smash its pitchers.",
  "13": "Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh as the nation of Israel was ashamed when it trusted Bethel.",
  "14": "\"How can you say, 'We are soldiers and warriors'?",
  "15": "The enemy will attack Moab and destroy its cities. Its finest young men will be slaughtered,\" declares the king, whose name is the Lord of Armies.",
  "16": "\"Moab's destruction is coming near; disaster is coming quickly.",
  "17": "Mourn over it, all of its neighbors and everyone who knows its fame. Say, 'Look at the strong staff, the beautiful rod, that is broken!'",
  "18": "\"People of Dibon, come down from your place of honor and sit on the dry ground. The destroyers of Moab will attack you. They will destroy your fortresses.",
  "19": "Stand by the road in Aroer, and watch. Ask those who are fleeing and those who are escaping what is happening.",
  "20": "They will answer, 'Moab is disgraced; it is defeated. Shout loudly, and cry. Tell the news in Arnon that Moab is destroyed.'",
  "21": "\"Judgment has come to all the cities on the plain: to Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,",
  "22": "Dibon, Nebo, Beth Diblathaim,",
  "23": "Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, Beth Meon,",
  "24": "Kerioth, Bozrah, and on all the cities of Moab, far and near.",
  "25": "\"Moab's horn is cut off, and its arm is broken,\" declares the Lord.",
  "26": "\"Get the people of Moab drunk; they have spoken against the Lord. They will wallow in their own vomit, and people will laugh at them.",
  "27": "People of Moab, didn't you laugh at the people of Israel? Were they caught among thieves? Whenever you talk about them you shake your heads in contempt.",
  "28": "People of Moab, abandon your cities. Live among the cliffs. Be like doves that make their nests at the entrance of a cave.",
  "29": "\"We have heard about the arrogance of Moab's people. They are very arrogant. They are very arrogant, conceited, and boastful.",
  "30": "I know how arrogant they are,\" declares the Lord, \"but it isn't right. They brag and don't do what they say.",
  "31": "That is why I will weep for Moab and cry for all of Moab. I will moan for the people of Kir Hareseth.",
  "32": "I will cry for you as Jazer cries. I will cry for you, grapevines of Sibmah. Your branches {once} spread as far as the sea, and they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The destroyer will destroy your ripened fruits and your grapes.",
  "33": "Joy and gladness have disappeared from the orchards and fields of Moab. I will stop the wine flowing from the winepresses. No one will stomp on grapes with shouts of joy. There will be shouts, but not shouts of joy.",
  "34": "\"The cry will be heard from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz. It will be heard from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. Even the streams of Nimrim will dry up.",
  "35": "I will stop those in Moab who come to worship sites, those who bring offerings to their gods,\" declares the Lord.",
  "36": "\"That is why I moan for Moab like a flute. I sound like a flute for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they gained has disappeared.",
  "37": "\"Every head is shaved, and every beard is cut off. There are gashes on every hand and sackcloth on every waist.",
  "38": "People in Moab will mourn on every rooftop and in every street. There will be mourning everywhere, because I will break Moab like a jar that no one wants,\" declares the Lord.",
  "39": "\"They will cry, 'Look how Moab is defeated! Moab turns away in shame!' Moab has become something ridiculed and something held in contempt by everyone around it.",
  "40": "\"This is what the Lord says: The enemy will swoop down like eagles and spread their wings over Moab.",
  "41": "The cities will be taken, and the fortified places will be captured. On that day Moab's soldiers will be like women in childbirth.",
  "42": "Moab will be destroyed as a nation, because it spoke against the Lord.",
  "43": "Disasters, pits, and traps are in store for those who live in Moab,\" declares the Lord.",
  "44": "\"Whoever flees from a disaster will fall into a pit. Whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a trap. I will bring a year of punishment to Moab,\" declares the Lord.",
  "45": "\"Those who flee will stand exhausted in the shadow of Heshbon. A fire will come out of Heshbon and a flame from Sihon. It will burn the foreheads of the people of Moab and the skulls of those noisy people.",
  "46": "How horrible it will be for you, Moab. You people of Chemosh will die. Your sons will be taken away into exile, and your daughters will be taken away into captivity.",
  "47": "But I will restore Moab in the last days,\" declares the Lord. The judgment against Moab ends here."
