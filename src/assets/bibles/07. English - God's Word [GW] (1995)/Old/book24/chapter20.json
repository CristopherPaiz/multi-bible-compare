  "3": "The next day when Pashhur took Jeremiah out of prison, Jeremiah said to him, \"The Lord doesn't call you Pashhur, but he calls you Terror Everywhere.",
  "4": "This is what the Lord says: I'm going to make you terrify yourself and all your friends. Their enemies' swords will kill them, and you will see it with your own eyes. I will hand all of Judah over to the king of Babylon. He will take the people away as captives to Babylon or kill them with swords.",
  "5": "I will hand all the riches of this city over to their enemies. This will include all its produce, all its valuables, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. Their enemies will loot them, take them away, and bring them to Babylon.",

  "8": "Each time I speak, I have to cry out and shout, \"Violence and destruction!\" The word of the Lord has made me the object of insults and contempt all day long.",

  "11": "But the Lord is on my side like a terrifying warrior. That is why those who persecute me will stumble. They can't win. They will be very ashamed that they can't succeed. Their eternal shame will not be forgotten.",

  "15": "Cursed is the man who made my father very happy with the news that he had just become the father of a baby boy.",
  "16": "May that man be like the cities that the Lord destroyed without pity. May he hear a cry of alarm in the morning and a battle cry at noon.",
  "17": "If only he had killed me while I was in the womb. Then my mother would have been my grave, and she would have always been pregnant.",
