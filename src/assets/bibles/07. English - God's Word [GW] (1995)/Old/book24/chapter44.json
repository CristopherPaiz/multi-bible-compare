  "1": "The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah about all the Jews living in Egypt at Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros.",
  "2": "This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disasters I brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah. Today they are deserted ruins.",
  "3": "It is because their people did evil, and they made me angry. They went to burn incense and serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors heard of.",
  "4": "I have sent my servants the prophets to you again and again to tell you not to do these detestable things that I hate.",
  "5": "But you wouldn't listen or pay attention. You wouldn't turn from your wicked ways and wouldn't stop burning incense as an offering to other gods.",
  "6": "That is why my fury and anger were poured out and continued to burn in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. So they became the desolate ruin that they are today.",
  "7": "Now, this is what the Lord God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Why do you bring this terrible disaster on yourselves? Why do you keep destroying men, women, children, and babies from Judah until none are left?",
  "8": "Why do you make me angry by burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live. You will destroy yourselves and be cursed and ridiculed by all the nations on earth.",
  "9": "Have you forgotten the wicked things done by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, and by you and your wives in Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem?",
  "10": "You have not humbled yourselves even to this day. You haven't feared me or lived your lives by my teachings or by my decrees that I gave your ancestors.",
  "11": "This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: I'm going to bring disaster on you and destroy all of Judah.",
  "12": "I will take away from Judah those who are left, those who were determined to go to live in Egypt. They will die in Egypt. All of them, from the least important to the most important, will die in wars or be brought to an end by famines. They will become something cursed, ridiculed, and disgraced.",
  "13": "I will punish those living in Egypt as I punished Jerusalem with wars, famines, and plagues.",
  "14": "None of the people of Judah who went to live in Egypt will survive or return to Judah, where they long to return and live. Only a few refugees will return there.",
  "15": "Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women who were standing there, and all the people who lived at Pathros in Egypt answered Jeremiah. They said,",
  "16": "\"We won't listen to the message that you have spoken to us in the Lord's name.",
  "17": "We will do everything we said we would do. We will burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out wine offerings to her as our ancestors, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. We had plenty to eat then, and we lived comfortably and saw no disaster.",
  "18": "But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out wine offerings to her, we have had nothing but wars and famines.\"",
  "19": "The women added, \"When we burned incense to the queen of heaven, poured out wine offerings to her, and made cakes for her with her image on them, do you think our husbands didn't approve?\"",
  "20": "Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, to everyone who answered him,",
  "21": "\"Doesn't the Lord remember that you burned incense in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem along with your ancestors, your kings and your officials, and the people in the land?",
  "22": "The Lord could no longer bear the wicked and detestable things you did. That is why your land has become something ruined, destroyed, and cursed. No one lives in that land today.",
  "23": "You burned incense as offerings to other gods, sinned against the Lord, and wouldn't obey him. You didn't live by his teachings, decrees, or written instructions. That is why you have met with this disaster as it is today.\"",
  "24": "Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, \"Listen to the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who are in Egypt.",
  "25": "This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives made promises, and you have kept them. You said, 'We will certainly do what we vow. We will burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out wine offerings to her.' \"So go ahead. Keep your vows, and do what you vow.",
  "26": "But listen to the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who live in Egypt. 'I swear by my great name,' says the Lord, 'that no one from Judah who lives anywhere in Egypt will ever again call on my name and take the oath, \"As the Almighty Lord lives...\"",
  "27": "I am going to watch over them. I am going to watch over them to bring disasters, not blessings. In Egypt the people from Judah will die in wars and famines until everyone is gone.",
  "28": "Those who escape the wars will return to Judah from Egypt. Then all the people of Judah who went to live in Egypt will know whose words have come true, mine or theirs.",
  "29": "I will give you this sign,' declares the Lord. 'I will punish you in this place so that you will know that my threats of disaster will happen to you.",
  "30": "This is what the Lord says: I'm going to hand Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies and to those who want to kill him, just as I handed over King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to those who wanted to kill him.' \""
