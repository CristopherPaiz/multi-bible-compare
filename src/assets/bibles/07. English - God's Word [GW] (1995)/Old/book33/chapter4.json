  "1": "In the last days the mountain of the Lord's house will be established as the highest of the mountains and raised above the hills. People will stream to it.",

  "3": "Then he will judge disputes between many people and settle arguments between many nations far and wide. They will hammer their swords into plowblades and their spears into pruning shears. Nations will never fight against each other, and they will never train for war again.",
  "4": "They will sit under their grapevines and their fig trees, and no one will make them afraid. The Lord of Armies has spoken.",
  "5": "All the nations live by the names of their gods, but we will live by the name of the Lord our God forever.",
  "6": "\"When that day comes,\" declares the Lord, \"I will gather those who are lame. I will bring together those who are scattered and those whom I have injured.",

  "9": "Now why are you crying so loudly? Don't you have a king? Has your counselor died? Pain grips you like a woman in labor.",
  "10": "Daughter of Zion, writhe in pain and groan like a woman in labor. Now you will leave the city, live in the open fields, and go to Babylon. There you will be rescued. There the Lord will reclaim you from your enemies.",
  "11": "But now many nations gather against you. They say, \"Let's dishonor Zion and gloat over it.\"",
  "12": "They don't know the thoughts of the Lord or understand his plan. He will bring them together like cut grain on the threshing floor.",
  "13": "Get up and thresh, people of Zion. I will make your horns as hard as iron and your hoofs as hard as bronze. You will smash many nations into small pieces. You will claim their loot for the Lord, their wealth for the Lord of the whole earth."
