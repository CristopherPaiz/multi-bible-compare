  "1": "The Lord spoke his word to Micah, who was from Moresheth, when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. This is the vision that Micah saw about Samaria and Jerusalem.",
  "2": "Listen, all you people! Pay attention, earth and all who are on it. The Almighty Lord will be a witness against you. The Lord will be a witness from his holy temple.",
  "3": "The Lord is going to come from his place. He is going to come down and step on the worship places of the earth.",
  "4": "Mountains will melt under him like wax near a fire. Valleys will split apart like water pouring down a steep hill.",
  "5": "All this is because of Jacob's crime and Israel's sin. What is Jacob's crime? Isn't it Samaria? What is Judah's worship place? Isn't it Jerusalem?",
  "6": "So I will turn Samaria into a pile of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will roll its stones down into a valley and expose its foundations.",
  "7": "All its idols will be smashed to pieces. All its wages for being a prostitute will be burned. All its statues will be turned into a pile of rubble. Samaria collected its wages for being a prostitute. That money will again pay for prostitutes.",

  "13": "Harness the horses to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish. You were the first to lead the people of Zion into sin. The rebellious acts of Israel are found in you.",
  "14": "That is why you will give farewell gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Achzib will betray the kings of Israel.",
  "15": "I will again bring a conqueror against the inhabitants of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.",
  "16": "Shave your head in mourning for the children you love. Make yourselves as bald as vultures because your children will be taken from you into exile."
