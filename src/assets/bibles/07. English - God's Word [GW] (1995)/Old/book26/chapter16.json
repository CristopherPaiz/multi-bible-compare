  "35": "\"'Listen to the word of the Lord, you prostitute.",
  "36": "This is what the Almighty Lord says: You exposed yourself and uncovered your naked body when you gave yourself to your lovers and to all your disgusting idols. You also killed your children and sacrificed their blood to these idols.",
  "37": "That is why I will gather all your lovers with whom you found pleasure. I will have all those who love you and hate you gather around. I will uncover your body for them, and they will see you naked.",
  "38": "I will punish you the same way that those who are guilty of prostitution and murder are punished. I will give you the death penalty in my fury and burning anger.",

  "43": "\"'You didn't remember the time when you were young, and you made me very angry with all these things. So I will pay you back for what you have done, declares the Almighty Lord. Didn't you make wicked plans in addition to all your disgusting practices?",
  "44": "\"'Everyone who uses proverbs will speak the following saying against you: Like mother, like daughter.",
  "45": "You are your mother's daughter. She rejected her husband and her children. You are exactly like your sisters. They rejected their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.",

  "47": "You didn't follow their ways. You didn't do the same disgusting things that they did. It only took you a little time to be more corrupt than they ever were.",
  "48": "As I live, declares the Almighty Lord, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done.",
  "49": "This is what your sister Sodom has done wrong. She and her daughters were proud that they had plenty of food and had peace and security. They didn't help the poor and the needy.",
  "50": "They were arrogant and did disgusting things in front of me. So I did away with them when I saw this.",
  "51": "\"'Samaria didn't commit half the sins you did. You have done many more disgusting things than they ever did. Because of all the disgusting things that you have done, you make your sisters look innocent.",
  "52": "You will have to suffer disgrace because you accused your sisters. Yet, your sins are more disgusting than theirs. They look like they are innocent compared to you. Be ashamed of yourself and suffer disgrace, because you have made your sisters look like they are innocent.",

  "54": "You will have to suffer disgrace and be ashamed of everything you have done, including comforting them.",
  "55": "When Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters return to what they once were, you and your daughters will return to what you once were.",
  "56": "You didn't mention your sister Sodom when you were arrogant.",
  "57": "You didn't mention her before your wickedness was revealed. Now the daughters of Aram and their neighbors despise you. The daughters of the Philistines also despise you. Those around you hate you.",
  "58": "You must suffer because of all the crude and disgusting things you have done, declares the Lord.",
  "59": "\"'This is what the Almighty Lord says: I will give you what you deserve. You despised your marriage vows and rejected my promise.",
  "60": "I will remember the promise that I made with you when you were young, and I will make it a promise that will last forever.",
  "61": "Then you will remember what you have done. You will be ashamed when I return your older and younger sisters to you. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of my promise with you.",
  "62": "Then I will make my promise with you, and you will know that I am the Lord.",
  "63": "You will remember and be ashamed. You will never again open your mouth because of your disgrace when I forgive you for everything you did, declares the Almighty Lord.' \""
