  "2": "\"Son of man, what good is the wood from a vine? Is it better than the wood from a tree in the forest?",
  "3": "Do people use it to make something? Do they make a peg from it to hang things on?",
  "4": "No! It is only thrown into the fire as fuel. The fire burns up both its ends and chars its middle. Then can it be used to make anything?",
  "5": "When the vine was in perfect condition, it couldn't be made into anything. How can it be used to make anything after the fire has burned and charred it?",
  "6": "\"So this is what the Almighty Lord says: As a vine is taken from among the trees in the forest to be used to feed the fire, so I will take the people who live in Jerusalem to punish them.",
  "7": "I will turn against the people of Jerusalem. Even though they have escaped one fire, another fire will burn them. Then they will know that I am the Lord, because I will turn against them.",
  "8": "I will turn the country into a wasteland because they have been unfaithful,\" declares the Almighty Lord."
