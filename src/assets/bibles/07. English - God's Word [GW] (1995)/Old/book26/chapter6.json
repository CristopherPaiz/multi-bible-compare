  "13": "Then you will know that I am the Lord. \"'Those who are killed will lie beside the idols around their altars. They will lie on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every large tree and every leafy oak. These are the places where they made offerings to their disgusting idols.",
  "14": "I will use my power against them and destroy the land, from the desert to Diblah. Then they will know that I am the Lord.' \""
