  "1": "On the first day of the month in the eleventh year, the Lord spoke his word to me. He said,",
  "2": "\"Son of man, Tyre said this about Jerusalem: 'The city that was the gateway for the nations is destroyed, and its doors are swung open to me. I'll get rich now that it's ruined.'",
  "3": "So this is what the Almighty Lord says: I am against you, Tyre. I will bring many nations against you as the waves on the sea rise.",
  "4": "They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down its towers. Then I will sweep up the dust and turn Tyre into a bare rock.",
  "5": "It will become a place by the sea where people spread their fishing nets. I have spoken, declares the Almighty Lord. It will become a prize for the nations.",
  "6": "The people in the villages and on the mainland will die in battle. Then they will know that I am the Lord.",
  "7": "\"This is what the Almighty Lord says: From the north I'm going to bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon against you, Tyre. He is the greatest king. He will bring horses, chariots, war horses, many people, and many troops.",
  "8": "He will destroy the villages on your mainland. He will set up blockades, put up dirt ramps, and raise his shields against you.",
  "9": "He will direct his battering rams against your walls, and he will cut down your towers with his axes.",
  "10": "He will have so many horses that their dust will cover you. The noise from the war horses, wagon wheels, and chariots will shake your walls when he enters your gates. He will enter as people enter a conquered city.",
  "11": "With his horses' hoofs he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people in battle, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.",
  "12": "His troops will loot your riches and take your goods as prizes. They will destroy your walls and tear down your delightful homes. They will throw your stones, wood, and soil into the water.",
  "13": "\"I will put a stop to your noisy songs, and the music from your harps will no longer be heard.",
  "14": "I will turn you into bare rock. You will become a place to spread fishing nets. You will never be rebuilt. I, the Lord, have spoken, declares the Almighty Lord.",
  "15": "\"This is what the Almighty Lord says to Tyre: The people who live on the coast will shake with fear when they hear about your defeat. They will groan when your people are wounded and slaughtered.",
  "16": "Then the princes from the coast will come down from their thrones. They will remove their robes and take off their embroidered clothes. Dressed in terror, they will sit on the ground. They will tremble constantly and be shocked at you.",
  "17": "Then they will sing this funeral song for you: Tyre, you famous city, you have been destroyed. You have been shattered by the sea. You and your people ruled the sea. All your people terrified those who lived by the coast.",
  "18": "Your defeat will make the people who live by the coast tremble. Your end will terrify the islands in the sea.",
  "19": "\"This is what the Almighty Lord says: I will turn your city into ruins like cities that have no one living in them. I will bring the deep ocean over you, and the Mediterranean Sea will cover you.",
  "20": "I will bring you down with those who descend to the grave to join the people of long ago. I will make you live below the earth among the ancient ruins with those who go down to the grave. You will never return or take your place in the land of the living.",
  "21": "I will turn you into a terror, and you will no longer exist. People will look for you, but they will never see you again,\" declares the Almighty Lord."
