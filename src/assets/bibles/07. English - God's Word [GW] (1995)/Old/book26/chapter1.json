  "1": "On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year, while I was living among the exiles by the Chebar River, the sky opened, and I saw visions from God.",
  "2": "On the fifth day of the month, during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiakin,",
  "3": "the Lord spoke his word to the priest Ezekiel, son of Buzi, in Babylon by the Chebar River. The power of the Lord came over Ezekiel.",
  "4": "As I looked, I saw a storm coming from the north. There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light. The middle of the lightning looked like glowing metal.",
  "5": "In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like humans,",
  "6": "but each of them had four faces and four wings.",
  "7": "Their legs were straight, their feet were like those of calves, and they glittered like polished bronze.",
  "8": "They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings.",
  "9": "Their wings touched each other. The creatures went straight ahead, and they did not turn as they moved.",
  "10": "Their faces looked like this: From the front, each creature had the face of a human. From the right, each one had the face of a lion. From the left, each one had the face of a bull. And from the back, each one had the face of an eagle.",
  "11": "That is what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out, pointing upward. Each creature had two wings with which they touched each other. The other two wings covered their bodies.",
  "12": "Each of the creatures went straight ahead. They went wherever their spirit wanted to go, and they didn't turn as they moved.",
  "13": "The living creatures looked like burning coals and torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning came out of the fire.",
  "14": "The living creatures ran back and forth like lightning.",
  "15": "As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them.",
  "16": "This is how the wheels looked and how they were made: They looked like beryl. All four wheels looked the same. They looked like a wheel within a wheel.",
  "17": "Whenever they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without turning as they moved.",
  "18": "The rims of the wheels were large and frightening. They were covered with eyes.",
  "19": "When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.",
  "20": "Wherever their spirit wanted to go, the creatures went. The wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",
  "21": "So whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved. Whenever the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. And whenever the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",
  "22": "Something like a dome was spread over the heads of the living creatures. It looked like dazzling crystal.",
  "23": "Under the dome, each creature had two wings that were stretched out straight, touching one another. Each creature had two wings that covered its body.",
  "24": "When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings. The sound was like the noise of rushing water, like the thunder of the Almighty, like the commotion in an army camp. When the creatures stood still, they lowered their wings.",
  "25": "A voice came from above the dome over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.",
  "26": "Above the dome over their heads was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire. On the throne was a figure that looked like a human.",
  "27": "Then I saw what he looked like from the waist up. He looked like glowing bronze with fire all around it. From the waist down, he looked like fire. A bright light surrounded him.",
  "28": "The brightness all around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds. It was like the Lord's glory. When I saw it, I immediately bowed down, and I heard someone speaking."
