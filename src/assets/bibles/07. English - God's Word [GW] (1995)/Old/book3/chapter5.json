  "1": "{The Lord continued,} \"Now, if you are a witness under oath and won't tell what you saw or what you know, you are sinning and will be punished.",
  "2": "\"If you touch anything unclean—the unclean dead body of a wild or tame animal or the body of an unclean, swarming creature—and then ignore what you did, you are unclean and will be guilty.",
  "3": "\"If you become unclean by touching human uncleanness of any kind and then ignore it (although you know what you did), you will be guilty.",
  "4": "\"If you hastily take a vow about what you will or will not do (as some people do) and then ignore it (although you know what you said), you will be guilty.",
  "5": "\"So if you are guilty of any of these sins, you must confess it.",
  "6": "Bring your guilt offering to the Lord for the sin you committed. It must be a female sheep or goat as an offering for sin. Then the priest will make peace with the Lord for what you did wrong.",
  "7": "\"Now, if you cannot afford a sheep, you must bring to the Lord two mourning doves or two pigeons as a guilt offering for the sin you committed. One will be an offering for sin, the other a burnt offering.",
  "8": "Bring them to the priest, and he will sacrifice the offering for sin first. He will break the bird's neck without pulling its head off.",
  "9": "He will sprinkle some of the blood from the offering for sin on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood will be drained at the bottom of the altar. It is an offering for sin.",
  "10": "Then, following the proper procedures, he will sacrifice the second bird as a burnt offering. So the priest will make peace with the Lord for what you did wrong.",
  "11": "\"But if you cannot afford two mourning doves or two pigeons, then bring eight cups of flour as an offering for the sin you committed. Never put olive oil on it or add incense to it, because it is an offering for sin.",
  "12": "Bring it to the priest. The priest will take a handful of it. He will burn it as a reminder on top of the offering by fire to the Lord on the altar. It is an offering for sin.",
  "13": "So the priest will make peace with the Lord for what you did wrong, and you will be forgiven. The offering will belong to the priest like the grain offering.\"",
  "14": "The Lord spoke to Moses,",
  "15": "\"If any of you fail to do your duty by unintentionally doing something wrong with any of the Lord's holy things, bring a guilt offering to the Lord. It must be a ram that has no defects or its value in silver weighed according to the official standards of the holy place.",
  "16": "Pay for whatever holy things you used plus one-fifth more. Give it to the priest. So the priest will use the ram sacrificed for the guilt offering to make peace with the Lord for what you did wrong, and you will be forgiven.",
  "17": "\"If any of you do wrong—even one thing forbidden by any of the Lord's commands, but you didn't know it—when you realize your guilt, you must be punished.",
  "18": "You must bring the priest a ram that has no defects from the flock or its value in money for a guilt offering. The priest will make peace with the Lord for the wrong you did unintentionally (although you didn't know what you did), and you will be forgiven.",
  "19": "It is a guilt offering because you are certainly guilty as far as the Lord is concerned.\""
