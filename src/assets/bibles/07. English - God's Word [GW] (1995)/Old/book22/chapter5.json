  "1": "Groom My bride, my sister, I will come to my garden. I will gather my myrrh with my spice. I will eat my honeycomb with my honey. I will drink my wine with my milk. Eat, my friends! Drink and become intoxicated with expressions of love!",
  "2": "Bride I sleep, but my mind is awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking. Groom Open to me, my true love, my sister, my dove, my perfect one. My head is wet with dew, my hair with the dewdrops of night.",

  "14": "His hands are disks of gold set with emerald. His chest is a block of ivory covered with sapphires.",
  "15": "His legs are columns of marble set on bases of pure gold. His form is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.",
  "16": "His mouth is sweet in every way. Everything about him is desirable! This is my beloved, and this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem."
