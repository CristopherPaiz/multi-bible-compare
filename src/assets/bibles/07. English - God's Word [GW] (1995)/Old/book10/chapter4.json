  "1": "When Saul's son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost his courage, and all Israel was alarmed.",
  "2": "Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding parties. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Rechab. They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin. (Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin,",
  "3": "even though the people of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim. They still live there today.",
  "4": "In addition, Saul's son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about {the death of} Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled {to Gittaim}. She was in a hurry when she left, and he fell {from her arms} and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)",
  "5": "Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, came to Ishbosheth's home at the hottest time of the day. Ishbosheth was taking his midday nap",

  "7": "(They had come into the house while Ishbosheth was sleeping on his bed in his bedroom. They stabbed him, killed him, and cut off his head.) They took his head and traveled all night along the road to the plains.",

  "11": "How much more {should I reward} wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home? The Lord has rescued me from every trouble. I solemnly swear, as the Lord lives, I'll now seek revenge for his murder and rid the land of you.\"",
  "12": "So David gave an order to his young men, who executed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung their dead bodies by the pond in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron."
