  "1": "A day is going to come for the Lord when the loot you have taken will be divided among you.",

  "3": "Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations as he does when he fights a battle.",

  "5": "Then you will flee to the valley of my mountains, because this valley between the mountains will go as far as Azel. You will flee as you did from the earthquake at the time of King Uzziah of Judah. The Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones will be with him.",

  "11": "People will live there, and it will never be threatened with destruction. Jerusalem will live securely.",
  "12": "This will be the plague the Lord will use to strike all the people from the nations that have gone to war against Jerusalem. Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.",
  "13": "On that day a large-scale panic from the Lord will spread among them. One person will grab the hand of another, and one will attack the other.",
  "14": "Judah will also fight in Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected, a very large amount of gold, silver, and clothes.",
  "15": "A similar plague will also affect horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all other animals in those camps.",

  "18": "If the people of Egypt won't go or enter Jerusalem, then {rain won't fall} on them. The plague the Lord uses to strike the nations will affect those who won't come to celebrate the Festival of Booths.",
