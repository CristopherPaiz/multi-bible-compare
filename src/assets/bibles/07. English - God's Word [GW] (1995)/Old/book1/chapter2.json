  "1": "So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed.",
  "2": "On the seventh day, having finished his task, God rested from all his work.",
  "3": "And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when he rested from his work of creation.",
  "4": "This is the account of the creation of the heavens and the earth. When the Lord God made the heavens and the earth,",
  "5": "there were no plants or grain growing on the earth, for the Lord God had not sent any rain. And no one was there to cultivate the soil.",
  "6": "But water came up out of the ground and watered all the land.",
  "7": "And the Lord God formed a man's body from the dust of the ground and breathed into it the breath of life. And the man became a living person.",
  "8": "Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had created.",
  "9": "And the Lord God planted all sorts of trees in the gardenâ€”beautiful trees that produced delicious fruit. At the center of the garden he placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.",
  "10": "A river flowed from the land of Eden, watering the garden and then dividing into four branches.",
  "11": "One of these branches is the Pishon, which flows around the entire land of Havilah, where gold is found.",

  "16": "But the Lord God gave him this warning: \"You may freely eat any fruit in the garden",
  "17": "except fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat of its fruit, you will surely die.\"",
  "18": "And the Lord God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a companion who will help him.\"",
  "19": "So the Lord God formed from the soil every kind of animal and bird. He brought them to Adam to see what he would call them, and Adam chose a name for each one.",
  "20": "He gave names to all the livestock, birds, and wild animals. But still there was no companion suitable for him.",
  "21": "So the Lord God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep. He took one of Adam's ribs and closed up the place from which he had taken it.",
  "22": "Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib and brought her to Adam.",
  "23": "\"At last!\" Adam exclaimed. \"She is part of my own flesh and bone! She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of a man.\"",
  "24": "This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.",
  "25": "Now, although Adam and his wife were both naked, neither of them felt any shame."
