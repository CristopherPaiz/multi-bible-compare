  "8": "But Joseph refused. \"Look,\" he told her, \"my master trusts me with everything in his entire household.",
  "9": "No one here has more authority than I do! He has held back nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How could I ever do such a wicked thing? It would be a great sin against God.\"",
  "10": "She kept putting pressure on him day after day, but he refused to sleep with her, and he kept out of her way as much as possible.",

  "17": "she told him her story. \"That Hebrew slave you've had around here tried to make a fool of me,\" she said.",
  "18": "\"I was saved only by my screams. He ran out, leaving his shirt behind!\"",
  "19": "After hearing his wife's story, Potiphar was furious!",
  "20": "He took Joseph and threw him into the prison where the king's prisoners were held.",
  "21": "But the Lord was with Joseph there, too, and he granted Joseph favor with the chief jailer.",
  "22": "Before long, the jailer put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and over everything that happened in the prison.",
  "23": "The chief jailer had no more worries after that, because Joseph took care of everything. The Lord was with him, making everything run smoothly and successfully."
