  "2": "On the second day, while they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther, \"What is your request, Queen Esther? It will be granted to you. And what would you like? Even if it is up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted.\"",
  "3": "Then Queen Esther answered, \"If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, Your Majesty, spare my life. That is my request. And spare the life of my people. That is what I ask for.",
  "4": "You see, we—my people and I—have been sold so that we can be wiped out, killed, and destroyed. If our men and women had only been sold as slaves, I would have kept silent because the enemy is not worth troubling you about, Your Majesty.\"",

  "8": "When the king returned from the palace garden to the palace dining room, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was lying. The king thought, \"Is he even going to rape the queen while I'm in the palace?\" Then the king passed sentence on him, and servants covered Haman's face.",
  "9": "Harbona, one of the eunuchs present with the king, said, \"What a coincidence! The 75-foot pole Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke up for the well-being of the king, is still standing at Haman's house.\" The king responded, \"Hang him on it!\"",
  "10": "So servants hung Haman's {dead body} on the very pole he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king got over his raging anger."
