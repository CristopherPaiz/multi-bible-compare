  "1": "When Mordecai found out about everything that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went into the middle of the city and cried loudly and bitterly.",
  "2": "He even went right up to the king's gate. (No one could enter it wearing sackcloth.)",
  "3": "In every province touched by the king's command and decree, the Jews went into mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing. Many put on sackcloth and ashes.",
  "4": "Esther's servants and eunuchs came and informed her {about Mordecai}. The queen was stunned. She sent clothing for Mordecai to put on in place of his sackcloth, but he refused to accept it.",
  "5": "Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs appointed to serve her. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out what was going on and why.",

  "12": "So Esther's servants told Mordecai what Esther said.",
  "13": "Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther, \"Do not imagine that just because you are in the king's palace you will be any safer than all the rest of the Jews.",
  "14": "The fact is, even if you remain silent now, someone else will help and rescue the Jews, but you and your relatives will die. And who knows, you may have gained your royal position for a time like this.\"",
  "15": "Esther sent this reply back to Mordecai,",
  "16": "\"Assemble all the Jews in Susa. Fast for me: Do not eat or drink at all for three entire days. My servants and I will also fast. After that, I will go to the king, even if it is against a royal decree. If I die, I die.\"",
  "17": "Mordecai did just as Esther had commanded him."
