  "9": "If there is a dispute over the ownership of a bull, a donkey, a sheep, an article of clothing, or any {other} lost property which two people claim as their own, both people must bring their case to God. The one whom God declares guilty must make up for his neighbor's loss with double the amount.",
  "10": "\"This is what you must do whenever someone gives his neighbor a donkey, a bull, a sheep, or any other kind of animal to keep for him, and it dies, is injured, or is captured in war, and there are no witnesses.",
  "11": "The case between them must be settled by swearing an oath to the Lord that the neighbor did not take the other person's animal. The owner must accept the oath. The neighbor doesn't have to make up for the loss.",
  "12": "But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, he must make up for the owner's loss.",

  "26": "If you take any of your neighbor's clothes as collateral, give it back to him by sunset.",
  "27": "It may be the only clothes he has to cover his body. What else will he sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will listen because I am compassionate.",
