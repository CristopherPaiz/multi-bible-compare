  "1": "Moses was taking care of the sheep of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. As he led the sheep to the far side of the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of God.",
  "2": "The Messenger of the Lord appeared to him there as flames of fire coming out of a bush. Moses looked, and although the bush was on fire, it was not burning up.",
  "3": "So he thought, \"Why isn't this bush burning up? I must go over there and see this strange sight.\"",
  "4": "When the Lord saw that Moses had come over to see it, God called to him from the bush, \"Moses, Moses!\" Moses answered, \"Here I am!\"",
  "5": "God said, \"Don't come any closer! Take off your sandals because this place where you are standing is holy ground.",
  "6": "I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.",
  "7": "The Lord said, \"I have seen the misery of my people in Egypt, and I have heard them crying out because of the slave drivers. I know how much they're suffering.",
  "8": "I have come to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good land with plenty of room {for everyone}. It is a land flowing with milk and honey where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites live.",
  "9": "I have heard the cry of the people of Israel. I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them.",
  "10": "Now, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you can bring my people Israel out of Egypt.\"",
  "11": "But Moses said to God, \"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the people of Israel out of Egypt?\"",
  "12": "God answered, \"I will be with you. And this will be the proof that I sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.\"",
  "13": "Then Moses replied to God, \"Suppose I go to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?\"",
  "14": "God answered Moses, \"I Am Who I Am. This is what you must say to the people of Israel: 'I Am has sent me to you.' \"",
  "15": "Again God said to Moses, \"This is what you must say to the people of Israel: The Lord God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever. This is my title throughout every generation.",
  "16": "\"Go, assemble the leaders of Israel. Say to them, 'The Lord God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appeared to me. He said, \"I have paid close attention to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.",
  "17": "I promise I will take you away from your misery in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.\" '",
  "18": "\"The leaders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the leaders must go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.'",
  "19": "I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, even if he is forced to.",
  "20": "So I will use my power to strike Egypt. After all the miracles that I will do there, he will let you go.",
  "21": "I will make the Egyptians kind to the people of Israel so that, when you leave, you will not leave empty-handed.",
  "22": "\"Every Hebrew woman should ask her Egyptian neighbor and any woman living in her home for silver and gold jewelry and for clothes. Put them on your sons and daughters. This way you will strip Egypt of its wealth.\""
