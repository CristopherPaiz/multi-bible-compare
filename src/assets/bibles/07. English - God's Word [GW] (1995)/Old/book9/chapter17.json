  "28": "Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard David talking to the men. Then Eliab became angry with David. \"Why did you come here,\" he asked him, \"and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how overconfident and headstrong you are.

  "34": "David replied to Saul, \"I am a shepherd for my father's sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,",
  "35": "I went after it, struck it, and rescued the sheep from its mouth. If it attacked me, I took hold of its mane, struck it, and killed it.",

  "41": "The Philistine, preceded by the man carrying his shield, was coming closer and closer to David.",

  "44": "\"Come on,\" the Philistine told David, \"and I'll give your body to the birds.\"",
  "45": "David told the Philistine, \"You come to me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of Armies, the God of the army of Israel, whom you have insulted.",
  "46": "Today the Lord will hand you over to me. I will strike you down and cut off your head. And this day I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals. The whole world will know that Israel has a God.",
