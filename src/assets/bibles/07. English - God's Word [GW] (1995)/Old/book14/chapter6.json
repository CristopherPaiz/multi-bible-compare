  "4": "\"Thanks be to the Lord God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David; with his hand he carried it out. He said,",
  "5": "'Ever since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I didn't choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a temple for my name. And I didn't choose any man to be prince over my people Israel.",
  "6": "But now I've chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name; I've chosen David to rule my people Israel.'",
  "7": "\"My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel.",
  "8": "However, the Lord said to my father David, 'Since you had your heart set on building a temple for my name, your intentions were good.",
  "9": "But you must not build the temple. Instead, your own son will build the temple for my name.'",
  "10": "The Lord has kept the promise he made. I've taken my father David's place, and I sit on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised. I've built the temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel.",

  "15": "You have kept your promise to my father David, your servant. With your mouth you promised it. With your hand you carried it out as it is today.",
  "16": "\"Now, Lord God of Israel, keep your promise to my father David, your servant. You said, 'You will never fail to have an heir sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel if your descendants are faithful to me as you have been faithful to me.'",
  "17": "\"So now, Lord God of Israel, may the promise you made to David, your servant, come true.",
  "18": "\"Does God really live on earth with people? If heaven itself, the highest heaven, cannot hold you, then how can this temple that I have built?",
  "19": "Nevertheless, my Lord God, please pay attention to my prayer for mercy. Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you.",
  "20": "Day and night may your eyes be on this temple, the place about which you said your name will be there. Listen to me as I pray toward this place.",

  "30": "Hear {them} in heaven, where you live. Forgive {them}, and give each person the proper reply. (You know what is in their hearts, because you alone know what is in people's hearts.)",
  "31": "Then, as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors, they will fear you and follow you.",
  "32": "\"People who are not Israelites will come from distant countries because of your great name, mighty hand, and powerful arm. When they come to pray facing this temple,",
  "33": "then hear {them} in heaven, the place where you live. Do everything they ask you so that all the people of the world may know your name and fear you like your people Israel and learn that this temple which I built bears your name.",

  "38": "if they change their attitude toward you in the land where they are captives, if they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors, and the city you have chosen, and the temple I have built for your name,",
  "39": "then in heaven, the place where you live, hear their prayer for mercy. Do what is right for them. Forgive your people, who have sinned against you.",
  "40": "\"Finally, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers {offered} in this place.",
  "41": "\"Now arise, and come to your resting place, Lord Godâ€” you and the ark of your power. Clothe your priests, Lord God, with salvation. Let your godly ones rejoice in what is good.",
  "42": "Lord God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember your mercy to your servant David!\""
