  "16": "As he was talking, the king asked him, \"Did we make you an adviser to the king? Stop! Do you want me to have you killed?\" The prophet stopped. He said, \"I know that God has decided to destroy you because you did this, but you refuse to listen to my advice.\"",

  "19": "You say you defeated Edom, and now you've become arrogant enough to look for more fame. Stay home! Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you?\"",
