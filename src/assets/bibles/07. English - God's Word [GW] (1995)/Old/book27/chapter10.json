  "1": "In Cyrus' third year as king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel (who had been renamed Belteshazzar). The message was true. It was about a great war. Daniel understood the message because he was given insight during the vision.",
  "2": "During those days I, Daniel, mourned for three whole weeks.",
  "3": "I didn't eat any good-tasting food. No meat or wine entered my mouth. I didn't wash myself until the entire three weeks were over.",
  "4": "On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was by the great Tigris River.",
  "5": "When I looked up, I saw a man dressed in linen, and he had a belt made of gold from Uphaz around his waist.",
  "6": "His body was like beryl. His face looked like lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches. His arms and legs looked like polished bronze. When he spoke, his voice sounded like the roar of a crowd.",
  "7": "I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision. The men with me didn't see the vision. Yet, they started to tremble violently, and they quickly hid themselves.",
  "8": "So I was left alone to see this grand vision. I had no strength left in me. My face turned deathly pale, and I was helpless.",
  "9": "I heard the man speak, and as I listened to his words, I fainted facedown on the ground.",
  "10": "Then a hand touched me and made my hands and knees shake.",
  "11": "The man said to me, \"Daniel, you are highly respected. Pay attention to my words. Stand up, because I've been sent to you.\" When he said this to me, I stood up, trembling.",
  "12": "He told me, \"Don't be afraid, Daniel. God has heard everything that you said ever since the first day you decided to humble yourself in front of your God so that you could learn to understand things. I have come in response to your prayer.",
  "13": "The commander of the Persian kingdom opposed me for 21 days. But then Michael, one of the chief commanders, came to help me because I was left alone with the kings of Persia.",
  "14": "I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the last days, because the vision is about times still to come.\"",
  "15": "When he said this to me, I bowed down with my face touching the ground and was silent.",
  "16": "Then someone who looked like a human touched my lips. I opened my mouth and began to talk. I said to the person standing in front of me, \"Sir, because of this vision, pain has overwhelmed me, and I'm helpless.",
  "17": "How can I talk to you, sir? I have no strength left, and the wind has been knocked out of me.\"",
  "18": "Again, the person who looked like a human touched me, and I became stronger.",
  "19": "He said, \"Don't be afraid. You are highly respected. Everything is alright! Be strong! Be strong!\" As he talked to me, I became stronger. I said, \"Sir, tell me what you came to say. You have strengthened me.\"",
  "20": "He asked, \"Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight the commander of Persia. When I go, the commander of Greece will come.",
  "21": "However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the true writings. No one will support me when I fight these commanders except your commander, Michael."
