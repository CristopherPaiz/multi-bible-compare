  "3": "\"Now this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, either an ox or a sheep, of which they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.",
  "4": "\"You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, your new wine, and your oil, and the first shearing of your sheep.",
  "5": "\"For the LORD your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes, to stand and serve in the name of the LORD forever.",

  "15": "\"The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.",
  "16": "\"This is according to all that you asked of the LORD your God in Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, let me not see this great fire anymore, or I will die.'",
  "17": "\"The LORD said to me, 'They have spoken well.",
  "18": "'I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.",
  "19": "'It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him.",
  "20": "'But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.'",
  "21": "\"You may say in your heart, 'How will we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?'",
  "22": "\"When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him."
