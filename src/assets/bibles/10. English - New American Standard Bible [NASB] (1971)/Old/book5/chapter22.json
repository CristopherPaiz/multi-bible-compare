  "3": "\"Thus you shall do with his donkey, and you shall do the same with his garment, and you shall do likewise with anything lost by your countryman, which he has lost and you have found. You are not allowed to neglect them.",
  "4": "\"You shall not see your countryman's donkey or his ox fallen down on the way, and pay no attention to them; you shall certainly help him to raise them up.",
  "5": "\"A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.",
  "6": "\"If you happen to come upon a bird's nest along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young;",

  "25": "\"But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lies with her shall die.",

  "27": "\"When he found her in the field, the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.",
  "28": "\"If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered,",
  "29": "then the man who lay with her shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall become his wife because he has violated her; he cannot divorce her all his days.",
