  "1": "When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside,",
  "2": "And they do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face.",
  "3": "With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies.",
  "4": "They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker Who ceases to stir up the fire From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.",
  "5": "On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers,",
  "6": "For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their plotting; Their anger smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.",
  "7": "All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me.",
  "8": "Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned.",
  "9": "Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know it.",
  "10": "Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this.",
  "11": "So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.",
  "12": "When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly.",
  "13": "Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.",
  "14": "And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me.",
  "15": "Although I trained and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me.",
  "16": "They turn, but not upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."
