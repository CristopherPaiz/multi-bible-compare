  "2": "The revolters have gone deep in depravity, But I will chastise all of them.",
  "3": "I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot, Israel has defiled itself.",

  "15": "I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me."
