  "1": "When Israel was a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.",
  "2": "The more they called them, The more they went from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols.",
  "3": "Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them.",
  "4": "I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down and fed them.",
  "5": "They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria--he will be their king Because they refused to return to Me.",
  "6": "The sword will whirl against their cities, And will demolish their gate bars And consume them because of their counsels.",
  "7": "So My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call them to the One on high, None at all exalts Him.",
  "8": "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, All My compassions are kindled.",
  "9": "I will not execute My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in wrath.",
  "10": "They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar And His sons will come trembling from the west.",
  "11": "They will come trembling like birds from Egypt And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD.",
  "12": "Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful."
