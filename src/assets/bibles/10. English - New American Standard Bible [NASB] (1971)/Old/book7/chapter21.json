  "5": "Then the sons of Israel said, \"Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?\" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, \"He shall surely be put to death.\"",

  "8": "And they said, \"What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?\" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.",
  "9": "For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.",
  "10": "And the congregation sent 12,000 of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, \"Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.",
  "11": "\"This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man.\"",

  "13": "Then the whole congregation sent word and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.",
  "14": "Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them.",

  "17": "They said, \"There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel.",
  "18": "\"But we cannot give them wives of our daughters.\" For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, \"Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.\"",

  "23": "The sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and lived in them.",
  "24": "The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance.",
  "25": "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes."
