  "4": "It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel.",
  "5": "When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob;",

  "17": "then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, \"Please let us pass through your land,\" but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.",
  "18": "'Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.",

  "30": "Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, \"If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,",
  "31": "then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.\"",

  "36": "So she said to him, \"My father, you have given your word to the LORD; do to me as you have said, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the sons of Ammon.\"",
  "37": "She said to her father, \"Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions.\"",
  "38": "Then he said, \"Go.\" So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity.",
  "39": "At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel,",
