  "1": "Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.",
  "2": "He said to his mother, \"The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.\" And his mother said, \"Blessed be my son by the LORD.\"",
  "3": "He then returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, \"I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will return them to you.\"",
  "4": "So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image, and they were in the house of Micah.",
  "5": "And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons, that he might become his priest.",

  "9": "Micah said to him, \"Where do you come from?\" And he said to him, \"I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find a place.\"",

  "11": "The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.",
  "12": "So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah.",
  "13": "Then Micah said, \"Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, seeing I have a Levite as priest.\""
