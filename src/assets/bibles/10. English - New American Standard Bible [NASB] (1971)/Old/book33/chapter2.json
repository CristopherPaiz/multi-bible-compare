  "1": "Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands.",
  "2": "They covet fields and then seize them, And houses, and take them away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance.",
  "3": "Therefore thus says the LORD, \"Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time.",
  "4": "\"On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation and say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.'",
  "5": "\"Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.",
  "6": "'Do not speak out,' so they speak out. But if they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back.",
  "7": "\"Is it being said, O house of Jacob: 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?' Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?",
  "8": "\"Recently My people have arisen as an enemy--You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, From those returned from war.",
  "9": "\"The women of My people you evict, Each one from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever.",
  "10": "\"Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction.",
  "11": "\"If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies and said, 'I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,' He would be spokesman to this people.",
  "12": "\"I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men.",
  "13": "\"The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head.\""
