  "1": "Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all that Solomon desired to do,",
  "2": "that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.",
  "3": "The LORD said to him, \"I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.",
  "4": "\"As for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you and will keep My statutes and My ordinances,",
  "5": "then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, 'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'",
  "6": "\"But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,",
  "7": "then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.",
  "8": "\"And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'",
  "9": "\"And they will say, 'Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.'\"",
  "10": "It came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house",
  "11": "(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire), then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.",
  "12": "So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.",
  "13": "He said, \"What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?\" So they were called the land of Cabul to this day.",
  "14": "And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.",
  "15": "Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.",
  "16": "For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.",
  "17": "So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon",
  "18": "and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,",
  "19": "and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.",
  "20": "As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,",
  "21": "their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly, from them Solomon levied forced laborers, even to this day.",
  "22": "But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen.",
  "23": "These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work.",
  "24": "As soon as Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo.",
  "25": "Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, burning incense with them on the altar which was before the LORD. So he finished the house.",
  "26": "King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.",
  "27": "And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon.",
  "28": "They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon."
