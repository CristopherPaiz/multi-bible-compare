  "8": "\"How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom.",
  "9": "\"Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.\"",
  "10": "She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.",
  "11": "Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great number of almug trees and precious stones.",
  "12": "The king made of the almug trees supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come in again nor have they been seen to this day.",

  "17": "He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.",
  "18": "Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold.",
  "19": "There were six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms.",
  "20": "Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.",
  "21": "All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.",

  "27": "The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland.",
  "28": "Also Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's merchants procured them from Kue for a price.",
  "29": "A chariot was imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150; and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of the Arameans."
