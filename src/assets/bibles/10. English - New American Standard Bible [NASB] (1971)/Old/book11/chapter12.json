  "10": "The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, \"Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!' But you shall speak to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins!",

  "15": "So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a turn of events from the LORD, that He might establish His word, which the LORD spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.",
  "16": "When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, \"What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!\" So Israel departed to their tents.",
  "17": "But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.",
