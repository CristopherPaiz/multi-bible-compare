  "30": "\"For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his stead shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.",
  "31": "\"You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.",
  "32": "\"Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the doorway of the tent of meeting.",
  "33": "\"Thus they shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy.",
  "34": "\"If any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.",
  "35": "\"Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; you shall ordain them through seven days.",
  "36": "\"Each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it.",
  "37": "\"For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy.",
  "38": "\"Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one year old lambs each day, continuously.",
  "39": "\"The one lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;",
  "40": "and there shall be one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering with one lamb.",
  "41": "\"The other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it the same grain offering and the same drink offering as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.",
  "42": "\"It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the doorway of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.",
  "43": "\"I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be consecrated by My glory.",
  "44": "\"I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to minister as priests to Me.",
  "45": "\"I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God.",
  "46": "\"They shall know that I am the LORD their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them; I am the LORD their God."
