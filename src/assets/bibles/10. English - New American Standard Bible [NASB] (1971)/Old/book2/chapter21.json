  "20": "\"If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished.",
  "21": "\"If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.",
  "22": "\"If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely, yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide.",

  "34": "the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall become his.",
  "35": "\"If one man's ox hurts another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally; and also they shall divide the dead ox.",
