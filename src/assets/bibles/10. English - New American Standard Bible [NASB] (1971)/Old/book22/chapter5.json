  "1": "\"I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.\"",
  "2": "\"I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: 'Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.'",
  "3": "\"I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?",
  "4": "\"My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were aroused for him.",
  "5": "\"I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.",
  "6": "\"I opened to my beloved, But my beloved had turned away and had gone! My heart went out to him as he spoke. I searched for him but I did not find him; I called him but he did not answer me.",
  "7": "\"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, They struck me and wounded me; The guardsmen of the walls took away my shawl from me.",
  "8": "\"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you will tell him: For I am lovesick.\"",
  "9": "\"What kind of beloved is your beloved, O most beautiful among women? What kind of beloved is your beloved, That thus you adjure us?\"",
  "10": "\"My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, Outstanding among ten thousand.",
  "11": "\"His head is like gold, pure gold; His locks are like clusters of dates And black as a raven.",
  "12": "\"His eyes are like doves Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk, And reposed in their setting.",
  "13": "\"His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Banks of sweet-scented herbs; His lips are lilies Dripping with liquid myrrh.",
  "14": "\"His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl; His abdomen is carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires.",
  "15": "\"His legs are pillars of alabaster Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon Choice as the cedars.",
  "16": "\"His mouth is full of sweetness. And he is wholly desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.\""
