  "1": "\"How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your hips are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist.",
  "2": "\"Your navel is like a round goblet Which never lacks mixed wine; Your belly is like a heap of wheat Fenced about with lilies.",
  "3": "\"Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle.",
  "4": "\"Your neck is like a tower of ivory, Your eyes like the pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, Which faces toward Damascus.",
  "5": "\"Your head crowns you like Carmel, And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads; The king is captivated by your tresses.",
  "6": "\"How beautiful and how delightful you are, My love, with all your charms!",
  "7": "\"Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are like its clusters.",
  "8": "\"I said, 'I will climb the palm tree, I will take hold of its fruit stalks.' Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples,",
  "9": "And your mouth like the best wine! It goes down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently through the lips of those who fall asleep.",
  "10": "\"I am my beloved's, And his desire is for me.",
  "11": "\"Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country, Let us spend the night in the villages.",
  "12": "\"Let us rise early and go to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded And its blossoms have opened, And whether the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love.",
  "13": "\"The mandrakes have given forth fragrance; And over our doors are all choice fruits, Both new and old, Which I have saved up for you, my beloved."
