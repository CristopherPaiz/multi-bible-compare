  "1": "\"I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys.\"",
  "2": "\"Like a lily among the thorns, So is my darling among the maidens.\"",
  "3": "\"Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.",
  "4": "\"He has brought me to his banquet hall, And his banner over me is love.",
  "5": "\"Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, Because I am lovesick.",
  "6": "\"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me.\"",
  "7": "\"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you do not arouse or awaken my love Until she pleases.\"",
  "8": "\"Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills!",
  "9": "\"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice.",
  "10": "\"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along.",
  "11": "'For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone.",
  "12": "'The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time has arrived for pruning the vines, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.",
  "13": "'The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along!'\"",
  "14": "\"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your form, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely.\"",
  "15": "\"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom.\"",
  "16": "\"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures his flock among the lilies.",
  "17": "\"Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.\""
