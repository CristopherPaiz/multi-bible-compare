  "2": "\"I would lead you and bring you Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates.",
  "3": "\"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me.\"",
  "4": "\"I want you to swear, O daughters of Jerusalem, Do not arouse or awaken my love Until she pleases.\"",
  "5": "\"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Leaning on her beloved? Beneath the apple tree I awakened you; There your mother was in labor with you, There she was in labor and gave you birth.",
  "6": "\"Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its flashes are flashes of fire, The very flame of the LORD.",

  "13": "\"O you who sit in the gardens, My companions are listening for your voice--Let me hear it!\"",
  "14": "\"Hurry, my beloved, And be like a gazelle or a young stag On the mountains of spices.\""
