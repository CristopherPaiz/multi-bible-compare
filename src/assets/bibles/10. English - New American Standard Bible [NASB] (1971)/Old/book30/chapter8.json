  "1": "Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, there was a basket of summer fruit.",
  "2": "He said, \"What do you see, Amos?\" And I said, \"A basket of summer fruit.\" Then the LORD said to me, \"The end has come for My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.",

  "12": "\"People will stagger from sea to sea And from the north even to the east; They will go to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, But they will not find it.",
  "13": "\"In that day the beautiful virgins And the young men will faint from thirst.",
  "14": "\"As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria, Who say, 'As your god lives, O Dan,' And, 'As the way of Beersheba lives,' They will fall and not rise again.\""
