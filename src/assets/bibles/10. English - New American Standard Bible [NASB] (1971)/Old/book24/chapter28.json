  "8": "\"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence.",
  "9": "\"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent.\"",

  "13": "\"Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, \"You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron.\"",

  "15": "Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, \"Listen now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.",
  "16": "\"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.'\"",
  "17": "So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month."
