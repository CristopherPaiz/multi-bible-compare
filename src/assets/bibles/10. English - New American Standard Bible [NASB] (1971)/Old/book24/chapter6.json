  "10": "To whom shall I speak and give warning That they may hear? Behold, their ears are closed And they cannot listen. Behold, the word of the LORD has become a reproach to them; They have no delight in it.",
  "11": "But I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary with holding it in. \"Pour it out on the children in the street And on the gathering of young men together; For both husband and wife shall be taken, The aged and the very old.",

  "16": "Thus says the LORD, \"Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'",
  "17": "\"And I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.'",
  "18": "\"Therefore hear, O nations, And know, O congregation, what is among them.",
  "19": "\"Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing disaster on this people, The fruit of their plans, Because they have not listened to My words, And as for My law, they have rejected it also.",
