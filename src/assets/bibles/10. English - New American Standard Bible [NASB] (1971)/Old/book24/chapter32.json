  "8": "\"Then Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD and said to me, 'Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.",
  "9": "\"I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver.",

  "15": "'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, \"Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.\"'",
  "16": "\"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the LORD, saying,",
  "17": "'Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,",
  "18": "who shows lovingkindness to thousands, but repays the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The LORD of hosts is His name;",

  "21": "'You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror;",
  "22": "and gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.",
  "23": "'They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this calamity come upon them.",
  "24": "'Behold, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it.",

  "26": "Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,",
  "27": "\"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?\"",

  "31": "\"Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from before My face,",
  "32": "because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.",
  "33": "\"They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction.",
  "34": "\"But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.",
  "35": "\"They built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.",
  "36": "\"Now therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine and by pestilence.'",
  "37": "\"Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety.",
