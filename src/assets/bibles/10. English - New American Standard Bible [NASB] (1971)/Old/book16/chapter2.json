  "2": "So the king said to me, \"Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.\" Then I was very much afraid.",
  "3": "I said to the king, \"Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?\"",
  "4": "Then the king said to me, \"What would you request?\" So I prayed to the God of heaven.",
  "5": "I said to the king, \"If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it.\"",
  "6": "Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, \"How long will your journey be, and when will you return?\" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time.",

  "8": "and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go.\" And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me.",

  "11": "So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.",
  "12": "And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.",

  "14": "Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.",
  "15": "So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.",
