  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,",
  "2": "\"Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself?",
  "3": "\"Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, Or profit if you make your ways perfect?",
  "4": "\"Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you, That He enters into judgment against you?",
  "5": "\"Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquities without end?",
  "6": "\"For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked.",
  "7": "\"To the weary you have given no water to drink, And from the hungry you have withheld bread.",
  "8": "\"But the earth belongs to the mighty man, And the honorable man dwells in it.",
  "9": "\"You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the orphans has been crushed.",
  "10": "\"Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you,",
  "11": "Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And an abundance of water covers you.",
  "12": "\"Is not God in the height of heaven? Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!",
  "13": "\"You say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?",
  "14": "'Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.'",
  "15": "\"Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked men have trod,",
  "16": "Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were washed away by a river?",
  "17": "\"They said to God, 'Depart from us!' And 'What can the Almighty do to them?'",
  "18": "\"Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.",
  "19": "\"The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them,",
  "20": "Saying, 'Truly our adversaries are cut off, And their abundance the fire has consumed.'",
  "21": "\"Yield now and be at peace with Him; Thereby good will come to you.",
  "22": "\"Please receive instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart.",
  "23": "\"If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent,",
  "24": "And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks,",
  "25": "Then the Almighty will be your gold And choice silver to you.",
  "26": "\"For then you will delight in the Almighty And lift up your face to God.",
  "27": "\"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows.",
  "28": "\"You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways.",
  "29": "\"When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will save.",
  "30": "\"He will deliver one who is not innocent, And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.\""
