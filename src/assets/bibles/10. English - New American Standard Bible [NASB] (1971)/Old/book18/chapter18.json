  "1": "Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,",
  "2": "\"How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding and then we can talk.",
  "3": "\"Why are we regarded as beasts, As stupid in your eyes?",
  "4": "\"O you who tear yourself in your anger--For your sake is the earth to be abandoned, Or the rock to be moved from its place?",
  "5": "\"Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the flame of his fire gives no light.",
  "6": "\"The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him.",
  "7": "\"His vigorous stride is shortened, And his own scheme brings him down.",
  "8": "\"For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing.",
  "9": "\"A snare seizes him by the heel, And a trap snaps shut on him.",
  "10": "\"A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path.",
  "11": "\"All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step.",
  "12": "\"His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side.",
  "13": "\"His skin is devoured by disease, The firstborn of death devours his limbs.",
  "14": "\"He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors.",
  "15": "\"There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.",
  "16": "\"His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above.",
  "17": "\"Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad.",
  "18": "\"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world.",
  "19": "\"He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned.",
  "20": "\"Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror.",
  "21": "\"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God.\""
