  "1": "Then Job replied,",
  "2": "\"Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning.",
  "3": "\"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!",
  "4": "\"I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments.",
  "5": "\"I would learn the words which He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me.",
  "6": "\"Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power? No, surely He would pay attention to me.",
  "7": "\"There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.",
  "8": "\"Behold, I go forward but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;",
  "9": "When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him.",
  "10": "\"But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.",
  "11": "\"My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.",
  "12": "\"I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.",
  "13": "\"But He is unique and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, that He does.",
  "14": "\"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such decrees are with Him.",
  "15": "\"Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him.",
  "16": "\"It is God who has made my heart faint, And the Almighty who has dismayed me,",
  "17": "But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom which covers me."
