  "1": "\"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?",
  "2": "\"Can you put a rope in his nose Or pierce his jaw with a hook?",
  "3": "\"Will he make many supplications to you, Or will he speak to you soft words?",
  "4": "\"Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him for a servant forever?",
  "5": "\"Will you play with him as with a bird, Or will you bind him for your maidens?",
  "6": "\"Will the traders bargain over him? Will they divide him among the merchants?",
  "7": "\"Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "\"Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle; you will not do it again!",
  "9": "\"Behold, your expectation is false; Will you be laid low even at the sight of him?",
  "10": "\"No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him; Who then is he that can stand before Me?",
  "11": "\"Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine.",
  "12": "\"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Or his mighty strength, or his orderly frame.",
  "13": "\"Who can strip off his outer armor? Who can come within his double mail?",
  "14": "\"Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth there is terror.",
  "15": "\"His strong scales are his pride, Shut up as with a tight seal.",
  "16": "\"One is so near to another That no air can come between them.",
  "17": "\"They are joined one to another; They clasp each other and cannot be separated.",
  "18": "\"His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.",
  "19": "\"Out of his mouth go burning torches; Sparks of fire leap forth.",
  "20": "\"Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth As from a boiling pot and burning rushes.",
  "21": "\"His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth.",
  "22": "\"In his neck lodges strength, And dismay leaps before him.",
  "23": "\"The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm on him and immovable.",
  "24": "\"His heart is as hard as a stone, Even as hard as a lower millstone.",
  "25": "\"When he raises himself up, the mighty fear; Because of the crashing they are bewildered.",
  "26": "\"The sword that reaches him cannot avail, Nor the spear, the dart or the javelin.",
  "27": "\"He regards iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood.",
  "28": "\"The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him.",
  "29": "\"Clubs are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin.",
  "30": "\"His underparts are like sharp potsherds; He spreads out like a threshing sledge on the mire.",
  "31": "\"He makes the depths boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment.",
  "32": "\"Behind him he makes a wake to shine; One would think the deep to be gray-haired.",
  "33": "\"Nothing on earth is like him, One made without fear.",
  "34": "\"He looks on everything that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride.\""
