  "4": "\"Does He not see my ways And number all my steps?",
  "5": "\"If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hastened after deceit,",

  "9": "\"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway,",
  "10": "May my wife grind for another, And let others kneel down over her.",
  "11": "\"For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be an iniquity punishable by judges.",
  "12": "\"For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon, And would uproot all my increase.",

  "18": "(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from infancy I guided her),",
  "19": "If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering,",
  "20": "If his loins have not thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,",
  "21": "If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw I had support in the gate,",
  "22": "Let my shoulder fall from the socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow.",
  "23": "\"For calamity from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing.",
  "24": "\"If I have put my confidence in gold, And called fine gold my trust,",
  "25": "If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had secured so much;",
  "26": "If I have looked at the sun when it shone Or the moon going in splendor,",
  "27": "And my heart became secretly enticed, And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,",
  "28": "That too would have been an iniquity calling for judgment, For I would have denied God above.",
  "29": "\"Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, Or exulted when evil befell him?",
  "30": "\"No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse.",
