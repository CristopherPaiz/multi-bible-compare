  "1": "\"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place.",
  "2": "\"Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth.",
  "3": "\"Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, And His lightning to the ends of the earth.",
  "4": "\"After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard.",
  "5": "\"God thunders with His voice wondrously, Doing great things which we cannot comprehend.",
  "6": "\"For to the snow He says, 'Fall on the earth,' And to the downpour and the rain, 'Be strong.'",
  "7": "\"He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work.",

  "20": "\"Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up?",
  "21": "\"Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind has passed and cleared them.",
  "22": "\"Out of the north comes golden splendor; Around God is awesome majesty.",
  "23": "\"The Almighty--we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.",
  "24": "\"Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard any who are wise of heart.\""
