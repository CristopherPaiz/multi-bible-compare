  "1": "\"Man, who is born of woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil.",
  "2": "\"Like a flower he comes forth and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.",
  "3": "\"You also open Your eyes on him And bring him into judgment with Yourself.",
  "4": "\"Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!",
  "5": "\"Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; And his limits You have set so that he cannot pass.",
  "6": "\"Turn Your gaze from him that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day like a hired man.",
  "7": "\"For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail.",
  "8": "\"Though its roots grow old in the ground And its stump dies in the dry soil,",
  "9": "At the scent of water it will flourish And put forth sprigs like a plant.",
  "10": "\"But man dies and lies prostrate. Man expires, and where is he?",
  "11": "\"As water evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up,",
  "12": "So man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no longer, He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep.",
  "13": "\"Oh that You would hide me in Sheol, That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns to You, That You would set a limit for me and remember me!",
  "14": "\"If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my struggle I will wait Until my change comes.",
  "15": "\"You will call, and I will answer You; You will long for the work of Your hands.",
  "16": "\"For now You number my steps, You do not observe my sin.",
  "17": "\"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You wrap up my iniquity.",
  "18": "\"But the falling mountain crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place;",
  "19": "Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So You destroy man's hope.",
  "20": "\"You forever overpower him and he departs; You change his appearance and send him away.",
  "21": "\"His sons achieve honor, but he does not know it; Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.",
  "22": "\"But his body pains him, And he mourns only for himself.\""
