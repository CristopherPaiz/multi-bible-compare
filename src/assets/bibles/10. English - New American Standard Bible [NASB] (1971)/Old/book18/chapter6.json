  "1": "Then Job answered,",
  "2": "\"Oh that my grief were actually weighed And laid in the balances together with my calamity!",
  "3": "\"For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; Therefore my words have been rash.",
  "4": "\"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, Their poison my spirit drinks; The terrors of God are arrayed against me.",
  "5": "\"Does the wild donkey bray over his grass, Or does the ox low over his fodder?",
  "6": "\"Can something tasteless be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?",
  "7": "\"My soul refuses to touch them; They are like loathsome food to me.",
  "8": "\"Oh that my request might come to pass, And that God would grant my longing!",
  "9": "\"Would that God were willing to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off!",
  "10": "\"But it is still my consolation, And I rejoice in unsparing pain, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "\"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should endure?",
  "12": "\"Is my strength the strength of stones, Or is my flesh bronze?",
  "13": "\"Is it that my help is not within me, And that deliverance is driven from me?",
  "14": "\"For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend; So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "\"My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi, Like the torrents of wadis which vanish,",
  "16": "Which are turbid because of ice And into which the snow melts.",
  "17": "\"When they become waterless, they are silent, When it is hot, they vanish from their place.",
  "18": "\"The paths of their course wind along, They go up into nothing and perish.",
  "19": "\"The caravans of Tema looked, The travelers of Sheba hoped for them.",
  "20": "\"They were disappointed for they had trusted, They came there and were confounded.",
  "21": "\"Indeed, you have now become such, You see a terror and are afraid.",
  "22": "\"Have I said, 'Give me something,' Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,'",
  "23": "Or, 'Deliver me from the hand of the adversary,' Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'?",
  "24": "\"Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have erred.",
  "25": "\"How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?",
  "26": "\"Do you intend to reprove my words, When the words of one in despair belong to the wind?",
  "27": "\"You would even cast lots for the orphans And barter over your friend.",
  "28": "\"Now please look at me, And see if I lie to your face.",
  "29": "\"Desist now, let there be no injustice; Even desist, my righteousness is yet in it.",
  "30": "\"Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern calamities?"
