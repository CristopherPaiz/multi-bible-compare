  "7": "\"Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will increase greatly.",
  "8": "\"Please inquire of past generations, And consider the things searched out by their fathers.",
  "9": "\"For we are only of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are as a shadow.",

  "17": "\"His roots wrap around a rock pile, He grasps a house of stones.",
  "18": "\"If he is removed from his place, Then it will deny him, saying, 'I never saw you.'",
  "19": "\"Behold, this is the joy of His way; And out of the dust others will spring.",
  "20": "\"Lo, God will not reject a man of integrity, Nor will He support the evildoers.",
  "21": "\"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter And your lips with shouting.",
  "22": "\"Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the tent of the wicked will be no longer.\""
