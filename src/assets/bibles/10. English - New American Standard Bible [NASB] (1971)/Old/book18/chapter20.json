  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,",
  "2": "\"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation.",
  "3": "\"I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.",
  "4": "\"Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth,",
  "5": "That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary?",
  "6": "\"Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds,",
  "7": "He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'",
  "8": "\"He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away.",
  "9": "\"The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him.",
  "10": "\"His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth.",
  "11": "\"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust.",

  "16": "\"He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue slays him.",
  "17": "\"He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds.",
  "18": "\"He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow it; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy them.",

  "20": "\"Because he knew no quiet within him, He does not retain anything he desires.",
  "21": "\"Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure.",
  "22": "\"In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him.",
  "23": "\"When he fills his belly, God will send His fierce anger on him And will rain it on him while he is eating.",
  "24": "\"He may flee from the iron weapon, But the bronze bow will pierce him.",
  "25": "\"It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him,",
  "26": "Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent.",
  "27": "\"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him.",
  "28": "\"The increase of his house will depart; His possessions will flow away in the day of His anger.",
  "29": "\"This is the wicked man's portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God.\""
