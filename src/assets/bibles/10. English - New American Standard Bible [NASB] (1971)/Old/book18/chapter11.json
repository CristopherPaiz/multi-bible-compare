  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,",
  "2": "\"Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted?",
  "3": "\"Shall your boasts silence men? And shall you scoff and none rebuke?",
  "4": "\"For you have said, 'My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.'",
  "5": "\"But would that God might speak, And open His lips against you,",
  "6": "And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.",
  "7": "\"Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?",
  "8": "\"They are high as the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol, what can you know?",
  "9": "\"Its measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.",
  "10": "\"If He passes by or shuts up, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him?",
  "11": "\"For He knows false men, And He sees iniquity without investigating.",
  "12": "\"An idiot will become intelligent When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man.",
  "13": "\"If you would direct your heart right And spread out your hand to Him,",
  "14": "If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;",
  "15": "\"Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without moral defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear.",
  "16": "\"For you would forget your trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember it.",
  "17": "\"Your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning.",
  "18": "\"Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely.",
  "19": "\"You would lie down and none would disturb you, And many would entreat your favor.",
  "20": "\"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And there will be no escape for them; And their hope is to breathe their last.\""
