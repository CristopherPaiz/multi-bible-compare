  "1": "\"Is not man forced to labor on earth, And are not his days like the days of a hired man?",
  "2": "\"As a slave who pants for the shade, And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,",
  "3": "So am I allotted months of vanity, And nights of trouble are appointed me.",
  "4": "\"When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn.",
  "5": "\"My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt, My skin hardens and runs.",
  "6": "\"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And come to an end without hope.",
  "7": "\"Remember that my life is but breath; My eye will not again see good.",
  "8": "\"The eye of him who sees me will behold me no longer; Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.",
  "9": "\"When a cloud vanishes, it is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.",
  "10": "\"He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know him anymore.",
  "11": "\"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "\"Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That You set a guard over me?",
  "13": "\"If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,'",
  "14": "Then You frighten me with dreams And terrify me by visions;",
  "15": "So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my pains.",
  "16": "\"I waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.",
  "17": "\"What is man that You magnify him, And that You are concerned about him,",
  "18": "That You examine him every morning And try him every moment?",
  "19": "\"Will You never turn Your gaze away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?",
  "20": "\"Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself?",
  "21": "\"Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will seek me, but I will not be.\""
