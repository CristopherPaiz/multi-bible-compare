  "2": "\"Can you count the months they fulfill, Or do you know the time they give birth?",
  "3": "\"They kneel down, they bring forth their young, They get rid of their labor pains.",
  "4": "\"Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them.",
  "5": "\"Who sent out the wild donkey free? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,",
  "6": "To whom I gave the wilderness for a home And the salt land for his dwelling place?",
  "7": "\"He scorns the tumult of the city, The shoutings of the driver he does not hear.",
  "8": "\"He explores the mountains for his pasture And searches after every green thing.",
  "9": "\"Will the wild ox consent to serve you, Or will he spend the night at your manger?",
  "10": "\"Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes, Or will he harrow the valleys after you?",
  "11": "\"Will you trust him because his strength is great And leave your labor to him?",
  "12": "\"Will you have faith in him that he will return your grain And gather it from your threshing floor?",

  "19": "\"Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?",
  "20": "\"Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrible.",
  "21": "\"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; He goes out to meet the weapons.",
  "22": "\"He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And he does not turn back from the sword.",
  "23": "\"The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and javelin.",
  "24": "\"With shaking and rage he races over the ground, And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet.",
  "25": "\"As often as the trumpet sounds he says, 'Aha!' And he scents the battle from afar, And the thunder of the captains and the war cry.",
  "26": "\"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south?",
  "27": "\"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up And makes his nest on high?",
  "28": "\"On the cliff he dwells and lodges, Upon the rocky crag, an inaccessible place.",
  "29": "\"From there he spies out food; His eyes see it from afar.",
  "30": "\"His young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is he.\""
