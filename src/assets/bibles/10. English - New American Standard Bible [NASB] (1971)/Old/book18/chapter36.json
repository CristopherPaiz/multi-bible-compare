  "1": "Then Elihu continued and said,",
  "2": "\"Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God's behalf.",
  "3": "\"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.",
  "4": "\"For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.",
  "5": "\"Behold, God is mighty but does not despise any; He is mighty in strength of understanding.",
  "6": "\"He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted.",
  "7": "\"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.",
  "8": "\"And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction,",
  "9": "Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves.",
  "10": "\"He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil.",
  "11": "\"If they hear and serve Him, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures.",
  "12": "\"But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword And they will die without knowledge.",
  "13": "\"But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them.",
  "14": "\"They die in youth, And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.",
  "15": "\"He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in time of oppression.",
  "16": "\"Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.",
  "17": "\"But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.",
  "18": "\"Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.",
  "19": "\"Will your riches keep you from distress, Or all the forces of your strength?",
  "20": "\"Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place.",
  "21": "\"Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you have preferred this to affliction.",
  "22": "\"Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?",
  "23": "\"Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'You have done wrong'?",
  "24": "\"Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung.",
  "25": "\"All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar.",
  "26": "\"Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The number of His years is unsearchable.",
  "27": "\"For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist,",
  "28": "Which the clouds pour down, They drip upon man abundantly.",
  "29": "\"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His pavilion?",
  "30": "\"Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea.",
  "31": "\"For by these He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance.",
  "32": "\"He covers His hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark.",
  "33": "\"Its noise declares His presence; The cattle also, concerning what is coming up."
