  "1": "Then Job continued his discourse and said,",
  "2": "\"As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,",
  "3": "For as long as life is in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils,",
  "4": "My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit.",
  "5": "\"Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.",
  "6": "\"I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not reproach any of my days.",
  "7": "\"May my enemy be as the wicked And my opponent as the unjust.",
  "8": "\"For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, When God requires his life?",
  "9": "\"Will God hear his cry When distress comes upon him?",
  "10": "\"Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?",
  "11": "\"I will instruct you in the power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.",
  "12": "\"Behold, all of you have seen it; Why then do you act foolishly?",
  "13": "\"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty.",
  "14": "\"Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread.",
  "15": "\"His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And their widows will not be able to weep.",
  "16": "\"Though he piles up silver like dust And prepares garments as plentiful as the clay,",
  "17": "He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver.",
  "18": "\"He has built his house like the spider's web, Or as a hut which the watchman has made.",
  "19": "\"He lies down rich, but never again; He opens his eyes, and it is no longer.",
  "20": "\"Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night.",
  "21": "\"The east wind carries him away, and he is gone, For it whirls him away from his place.",
  "22": "\"For it will hurl at him without sparing; He will surely try to flee from its power.",
  "23": "\"Men will clap their hands at him And will hiss him from his place."
