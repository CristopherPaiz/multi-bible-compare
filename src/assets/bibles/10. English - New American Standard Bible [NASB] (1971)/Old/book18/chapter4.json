  "2": "\"If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking?",
  "3": "\"Behold you have admonished many, And you have strengthened weak hands.",
  "4": "\"Your words have helped the tottering to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees.",
  "5": "\"But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are dismayed.",
  "6": "\"Is not your fear of God your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope?",
  "7": "\"Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?",
  "8": "\"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity And those who sow trouble harvest it.",
  "9": "\"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.",
  "10": "\"The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken.",
  "11": "\"The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.",
  "12": "\"Now a word was brought to me stealthily, And my ear received a whisper of it.",
  "13": "\"Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,",
  "14": "Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made all my bones shake.",

  "16": "\"It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes; There was silence, then I heard a voice:",
  "17": "'Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?",
  "18": "'He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error.",
  "19": "'How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!",
  "20": "'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unobserved, they perish forever.",
  "21": "'Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, yet without wisdom.'"
