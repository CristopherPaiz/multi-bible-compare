  "1": "\"However now, Job, please hear my speech, And listen to all my words.",
  "2": "\"Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my mouth speaks.",
  "3": "\"My words are from the uprightness of my heart, And my lips speak knowledge sincerely.",
  "4": "\"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "\"Refute me if you can; Array yourselves before me, take your stand.",
  "6": "\"Behold, I belong to God like you; I too have been formed out of the clay.",
  "7": "\"Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you.",
  "8": "\"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words:",
  "9": "'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.",
  "10": "'Behold, He invents pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy.",
  "11": "'He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.'",
  "12": "\"Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than man.",
  "13": "\"Why do you complain against Him That He does not give an account of all His doings?",
  "14": "\"Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, yet no one notices it.",
  "15": "\"In a dream, a vision of the night, When sound sleep falls on men, While they slumber in their beds,",
  "16": "Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction,",
  "17": "That He may turn man aside from his conduct, And keep man from pride;",
  "18": "He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from passing over into Sheol.",
  "19": "\"Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones;",
  "20": "So that his life loathes bread, And his soul favorite food.",
  "21": "\"His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones which were not seen stick out.",
  "22": "\"Then his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death.",
  "23": "\"If there is an angel as mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a man what is right for him,",
  "24": "Then let him be gracious to him, and say, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom';",
  "25": "Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor;",
  "26": "Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man.",
  "27": "\"He will sing to men and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me.",
  "28": "'He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life shall see the light.'",
  "29": "\"Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men,",
  "30": "To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life.",
  "31": "\"Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and let me speak.",
  "32": "\"Then if you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you.",
  "33": "\"If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.\""
