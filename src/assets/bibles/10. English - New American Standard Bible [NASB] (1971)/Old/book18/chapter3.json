  "1": "Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.",
  "2": "And Job said,",
  "3": "\"Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night which said, 'A boy is conceived.'",
  "4": "\"May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it.",
  "5": "\"Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.",
  "6": "\"As for that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.",
  "7": "\"Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it.",
  "8": "\"Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.",
  "9": "\"Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it wait for light but have none, And let it not see the breaking dawn;",
  "10": "Because it did not shut the opening of my mother's womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes.",
  "11": "\"Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire?",
  "12": "\"Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I should suck?",
  "13": "\"For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest,",

  "19": "\"The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master.",
  "20": "\"Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the bitter of soul,",
  "21": "Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures,",
  "22": "Who rejoice greatly, And exult when they find the grave?",
  "23": "\"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?",
  "24": "\"For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water.",
  "25": "\"For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls me.",
  "26": "\"I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.\""
