  "1": "Then Job responded,",
  "2": "\"Truly then you are the people, And with you wisdom will die!",
  "3": "\"But I have intelligence as well as you; I am not inferior to you. And who does not know such things as these?",
  "4": "\"I am a joke to my friends, The one who called on God and He answered him; The just and blameless man is a joke.",

  "20": "\"He deprives the trusted ones of speech And takes away the discernment of the elders.",
  "21": "\"He pours contempt on nobles And loosens the belt of the strong.",
  "22": "\"He reveals mysteries from the darkness And brings the deep darkness into light.",
  "23": "\"He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.",
  "24": "\"He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth's people And makes them wander in a pathless waste.",
  "25": "\"They grope in darkness with no light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man."
