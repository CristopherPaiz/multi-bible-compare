  "1": "Then Elihu continued and said,",
  "2": "\"Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who know.",
  "3": "\"For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.",
  "4": "\"Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.",
  "5": "\"For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my right;",
  "6": "Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'",
  "7": "\"What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water,",
  "8": "Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?",
  "9": "\"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing When he is pleased with God.'",
  "10": "\"Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong.",
  "11": "\"For He pays a man according to his work, And makes him find it according to his way.",
  "12": "\"Surely, God will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice.",
  "13": "\"Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has laid on Him the whole world?",
  "14": "\"If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,",
  "15": "All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust.",
  "16": "\"But if you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words.",
  "17": "\"Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One,",
  "18": "Who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' To nobles, 'Wicked ones';",
  "19": "Who shows no partiality to princes Nor regards the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands?",
  "20": "\"In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a hand.",
  "21": "\"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps.",
  "22": "\"There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.",
  "23": "\"For He does not need to consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment.",
  "24": "\"He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place.",
  "25": "\"Therefore He knows their works, And He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed.",
  "26": "\"He strikes them like the wicked In a public place,",
  "27": "Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways;",
  "28": "So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted--",
  "29": "When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, That is, in regard to both nation and man?--",
  "30": "So that godless men would not rule Nor be snares of the people.",
  "31": "\"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne chastisement; I will not offend anymore;",
  "32": "Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will not do it again'?",
  "33": "\"Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected it? For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know.",
  "34": "\"Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me,",
  "35": "'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.",
  "36": "'Job ought to be tried to the limit, Because he answers like wicked men.",
  "37": "'For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.'\""
