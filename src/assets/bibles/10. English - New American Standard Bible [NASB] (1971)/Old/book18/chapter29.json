  "1": "And Job again took up his discourse and said,",
  "2": "\"Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me;",
  "3": "When His lamp shone over my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;",
  "4": "As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship of God was over my tent;",
  "5": "When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were around me;",
  "6": "When my steps were bathed in butter, And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!",
  "7": "\"When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat in the square,",
  "8": "The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose and stood.",
  "9": "\"The princes stopped talking And put their hands on their mouths;",
  "10": "The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to their palate.",
  "11": "\"For when the ear heard, it called me blessed, And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me,",
  "12": "Because I delivered the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper.",
  "13": "\"The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, And I made the widow's heart sing for joy.",
  "14": "\"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban.",
  "15": "\"I was eyes to the blind And feet to the lame.",
  "16": "\"I was a father to the needy, And I investigated the case which I did not know.",
  "17": "\"I broke the jaws of the wicked And snatched the prey from his teeth.",
  "18": "\"Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand.",
  "19": "'My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies all night on my branch.",
  "20": "'My glory is ever new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.'",
  "21": "\"To me they listened and waited, And kept silent for my counsel.",
  "22": "\"After my words they did not speak again, And my speech dropped on them.",
  "23": "\"They waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouth as for the spring rain.",
  "24": "\"I smiled on them when they did not believe, And the light of my face they did not cast down.",
  "25": "\"I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners."
