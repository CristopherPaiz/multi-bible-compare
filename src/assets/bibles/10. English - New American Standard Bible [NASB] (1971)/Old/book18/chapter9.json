  "1": "Then Job answered,",
  "2": "\"In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in the right before God?",
  "3": "\"If one wished to dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand times.",
  "4": "\"Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has defied Him without harm?",
  "5": "\"It is God who removes the mountains, they know not how, When He overturns them in His anger;",
  "6": "Who shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;",
  "7": "Who commands the sun not to shine, And sets a seal upon the stars;",
  "8": "Who alone stretches out the heavens And tramples down the waves of the sea;",
  "9": "Who makes the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;",
  "10": "Who does great things, unfathomable, And wondrous works without number.",
  "11": "\"Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; Were He to move past me, I would not perceive Him.",
  "12": "\"Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, 'What are You doing?'",
  "13": "\"God will not turn back His anger; Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab.",
  "14": "\"How then can I answer Him, And choose my words before Him?",
  "15": "\"For though I were right, I could not answer; I would have to implore the mercy of my judge.",
  "16": "\"If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.",
  "17": "\"For He bruises me with a tempest And multiplies my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "\"He will not allow me to get my breath, But saturates me with bitterness.",
  "19": "\"If it is a matter of power, behold, He is the strong one! And if it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?",
  "20": "\"Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty.",
  "21": "\"I am guiltless; I do not take notice of myself; I despise my life.",
  "22": "\"It is all one; therefore I say, 'He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.'",
  "23": "\"If the scourge kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "\"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?",
  "25": "\"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.",
  "26": "\"They slip by like reed boats, Like an eagle that swoops on its prey.",
  "27": "\"Though I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sad countenance and be cheerful,'",
  "28": "I am afraid of all my pains, I know that You will not acquit me.",
  "29": "\"I am accounted wicked, Why then should I toil in vain?",
  "30": "\"If I should wash myself with snow And cleanse my hands with lye,",
  "31": "Yet You would plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would abhor me.",
  "32": "\"For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That we may go to court together.",
  "33": "\"There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand upon us both.",
  "34": "\"Let Him remove His rod from me, And let not dread of Him terrify me.",
  "35": "\"Then I would speak and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself."
