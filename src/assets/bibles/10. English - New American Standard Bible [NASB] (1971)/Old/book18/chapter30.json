  "1": "\"But now those younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.",
  "2": "\"Indeed, what good was the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them.",
  "3": "\"From want and famine they are gaunt Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation,",
  "4": "Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub.",
  "5": "\"They are driven from the community; They shout against them as against a thief,",
  "6": "So that they dwell in dreadful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.",
  "7": "\"Among the bushes they cry out; Under the nettles they are gathered together.",
  "8": "\"Fools, even those without a name, They were scourged from the land.",
  "9": "\"And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a byword to them.",
  "10": "\"They abhor me and stand aloof from me, And they do not refrain from spitting at my face.",
  "11": "\"Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me.",
  "12": "\"On the right hand their brood arises; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction.",
  "13": "\"They break up my path, They profit from my destruction; No one restrains them.",
  "14": "\"As through a wide breach they come, Amid the tempest they roll on.",
  "15": "\"Terrors are turned against me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.",
  "16": "\"And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have seized me.",
  "17": "\"At night it pierces my bones within me, And my gnawing pains take no rest.",
  "18": "\"By a great force my garment is distorted; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.",
  "19": "\"He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes.",
  "20": "\"I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me.",
  "21": "\"You have become cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You persecute me.",
  "22": "\"You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride; And You dissolve me in a storm.",
  "23": "\"For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house of meeting for all living.",
  "24": "\"Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help?",
  "25": "\"Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?",
  "26": "\"When I expected good, then evil came; When I waited for light, then darkness came.",
  "27": "\"I am seething within and cannot relax; Days of affliction confront me.",
  "28": "\"I go about mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help.",
  "29": "\"I have become a brother to jackals And a companion of ostriches.",
  "30": "\"My skin turns black on me, And my bones burn with fever.",
  "31": "\"Therefore my harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep."
