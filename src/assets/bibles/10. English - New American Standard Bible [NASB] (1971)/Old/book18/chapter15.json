  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,",
  "2": "\"Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge And fill himself with the east wind?",
  "3": "\"Should he argue with useless talk, Or with words which are not profitable?",
  "4": "\"Indeed, you do away with reverence And hinder meditation before God.",
  "5": "\"For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty.",
  "6": "\"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; And your own lips testify against you.",
  "7": "\"Were you the first man to be born, Or were you brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "\"Do you hear the secret counsel of God, And limit wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "\"What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we do not?",
  "10": "\"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Older than your father.",
  "11": "\"Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word spoken gently with you?",
  "12": "\"Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,",
  "13": "That you should turn your spirit against God And allow such words to go out of your mouth?",
  "14": "\"What is man, that he should be pure, Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?",
  "15": "\"Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones, And the heavens are not pure in His sight;",
  "16": "How much less one who is detestable and corrupt, Man, who drinks iniquity like water!",
  "17": "\"I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare;",
  "18": "What wise men have told, And have not concealed from their fathers,",
  "19": "To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them.",
  "20": "\"The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless.",
  "21": "\"Sounds of terror are in his ears; While at peace the destroyer comes upon him.",
  "22": "\"He does not believe that he will return from darkness, And he is destined for the sword.",
  "23": "\"He wanders about for food, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is at hand.",
  "24": "\"Distress and anguish terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,",
  "25": "Because he has stretched out his hand against God And conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty.",
  "26": "\"He rushes headlong at Him With his massive shield.",
  "27": "\"For he has covered his face with his fat And made his thighs heavy with flesh.",
  "28": "\"He has lived in desolate cities, In houses no one would inhabit, Which are destined to become ruins.",
  "29": "\"He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his grain will not bend down to the ground.",
  "30": "\"He will not escape from darkness; The flame will wither his shoots, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.",
  "31": "\"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For emptiness will be his reward.",
  "32": "\"It will be accomplished before his time, And his palm branch will not be green.",
  "33": "\"He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine, And will cast off his flower like the olive tree.",
  "34": "\"For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt.",
  "35": "\"They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, And their mind prepares deception.\""
