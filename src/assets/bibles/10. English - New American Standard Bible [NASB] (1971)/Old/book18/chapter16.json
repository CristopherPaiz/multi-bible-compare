  "1": "Then Job answered,",
  "2": "\"I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are you all.",
  "3": "\"Is there no limit to windy words? Or what plagues you that you answer?",
  "4": "\"I too could speak like you, If I were in your place. I could compose words against you And shake my head at you.",
  "5": "\"I could strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips could lessen your pain.",
  "6": "\"If I speak, my pain is not lessened, And if I hold back, what has left me?",
  "7": "\"But now He has exhausted me; You have laid waste all my company.",
  "8": "\"You have shriveled me up, It has become a witness; And my leanness rises up against me, It testifies to my face.",
  "9": "\"His anger has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My adversary glares at me.",
  "10": "\"They have gaped at me with their mouth, They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt; They have massed themselves against me.",

  "13": "\"His arrows surround me. Without mercy He splits my kidneys open; He pours out my gall on the ground.",
  "14": "\"He breaks through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a warrior.",
  "15": "\"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin And thrust my horn in the dust.",
  "16": "\"My face is flushed from weeping, And deep darkness is on my eyelids,",
  "17": "Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.",
  "18": "\"O earth, do not cover my blood, And let there be no resting place for my cry.",
  "19": "\"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And my advocate is on high.",
  "20": "\"My friends are my scoffers; My eye weeps to God.",
  "21": "\"O that a man might plead with God As a man with his neighbor!",
  "22": "\"For when a few years are past, I shall go the way of no return."
