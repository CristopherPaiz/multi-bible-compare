  "1": "\"Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?",

  "4": "\"His sons are far from safety, They are even oppressed in the gate, And there is no deliverer.",
  "5": "\"His harvest the hungry devour And take it to a place of thorns, And the schemer is eager for their wealth.",

  "7": "For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly upward.",
  "8": "\"But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my cause before God;",
  "9": "Who does great and unsearchable things, Wonders without number.",
  "10": "\"He gives rain on the earth And sends water on the fields,",
  "11": "So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety.",

  "19": "\"From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil will not touch you.",
  "20": "\"In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword.",
  "21": "\"You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.",
  "22": "\"You will laugh at violence and famine, And you will not be afraid of wild beasts.",
  "23": "\"For you will be in league with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.",
  "24": "\"You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit your abode and fear no loss.",
  "25": "\"You will know also that your descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth.",
  "26": "\"You will come to the grave in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season.",
  "27": "\"Behold this; we have investigated it, and so it is. Hear it, and know for yourself.\""
