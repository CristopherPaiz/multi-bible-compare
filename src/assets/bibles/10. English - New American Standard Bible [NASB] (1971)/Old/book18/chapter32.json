  "1": "Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.",
  "2": "But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God.",
  "3": "And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.",
  "4": "Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.",
  "5": "And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.",
  "6": "So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, \"I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.",
  "7": "\"I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom.",
  "8": "\"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.",
  "9": "\"The abundant in years may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice.",
  "10": "\"So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.'",
  "11": "\"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say.",
  "12": "\"I even paid close attention to you; Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words.",
  "13": "\"Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.'",
  "14": "\"For he has not arranged his words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.",
  "15": "\"They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have failed them.",
  "16": "\"Shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop and no longer answer?",
  "17": "\"I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion.",
  "18": "\"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.",
  "19": "\"Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst.",
  "20": "\"Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.",
  "21": "\"Let me now be partial to no one, Nor flatter any man.",
  "22": "\"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away."
