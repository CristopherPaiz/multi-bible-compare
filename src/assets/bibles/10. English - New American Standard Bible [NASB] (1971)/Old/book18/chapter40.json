  "1": "Then the LORD said to Job,",
  "2": "\"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it.\"",
  "3": "Then Job answered the LORD and said,",
  "4": "\"Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to You? I lay my hand on my mouth.",
  "5": "\"Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Even twice, and I will add nothing more.\"",
  "6": "Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm and said,",
  "7": "\"Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me.",
  "8": "\"Will you really annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified?",
  "9": "\"Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His?",
  "10": "\"Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity, And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.",
  "11": "\"Pour out the overflowings of your anger, And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low.",
  "12": "\"Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, And tread down the wicked where they stand.",
  "13": "\"Hide them in the dust together; Bind them in the hidden place.",
  "14": "\"Then I will also confess to you, That your own right hand can save you.",
  "15": "\"Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass like an ox.",
  "16": "\"Behold now, his strength in his loins And his power in the muscles of his belly.",
  "17": "\"He bends his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.",
  "18": "\"His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron.",
  "19": "\"He is the first of the ways of God; Let his maker bring near his sword.",
  "20": "\"Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the beasts of the field play there.",
  "21": "\"Under the lotus plants he lies down, In the covert of the reeds and the marsh.",
  "22": "\"The lotus plants cover him with shade; The willows of the brook surround him.",
  "23": "\"If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.",
  "24": "\"Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce his nose?"
