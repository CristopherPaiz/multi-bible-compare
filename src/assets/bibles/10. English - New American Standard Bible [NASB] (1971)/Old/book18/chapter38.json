  "1": "Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,",
  "2": "\"Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge?",
  "3": "\"Now gird up your loins like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me!",
  "4": "\"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding,",
  "5": "Who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it?",
  "6": "\"On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone,",
  "7": "When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy?",
  "8": "\"Or who enclosed the sea with doors When, bursting forth, it went out from the womb;",
  "9": "When I made a cloud its garment And thick darkness its swaddling band,",
  "10": "And I placed boundaries on it And set a bolt and doors,",
  "11": "And I said, 'Thus far you shall come, but no farther; And here shall your proud waves stop'?",
  "12": "\"Have you ever in your life commanded the morning, And caused the dawn to know its place,",
  "13": "That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?",
  "14": "\"It is changed like clay under the seal; And they stand forth like a garment.",
  "15": "\"From the wicked their light is withheld, And the uplifted arm is broken.",
  "16": "\"Have you entered into the springs of the sea Or walked in the recesses of the deep?",
  "17": "\"Have the gates of death been revealed to you, Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?",
  "18": "\"Have you understood the expanse of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.",
  "19": "\"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,",
  "20": "That you may take it to its territory And that you may discern the paths to its home?",
  "21": "\"You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great!",
  "22": "\"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,",
  "23": "Which I have reserved for the time of distress, For the day of war and battle?",
  "24": "\"Where is the way that the light is divided, Or the east wind scattered on the earth?",
  "25": "\"Who has cleft a channel for the flood, Or a way for the thunderbolt,",
  "26": "To bring rain on a land without people, On a desert without a man in it,",
  "27": "To satisfy the waste and desolate land And to make the seeds of grass to sprout?",
  "28": "\"Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?",
  "29": "\"From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?",
  "30": "\"Water becomes hard like stone, And the surface of the deep is imprisoned.",
  "31": "\"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the cords of Orion?",
  "32": "\"Can you lead forth a constellation in its season, And guide the Bear with her satellites?",
  "33": "\"Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, Or fix their rule over the earth?",
  "34": "\"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, So that an abundance of water will cover you?",
  "35": "\"Can you send forth lightnings that they may go And say to you, 'Here we are'?",
  "36": "\"Who has put wisdom in the innermost being Or given understanding to the mind?",
  "37": "\"Who can count the clouds by wisdom, Or tip the water jars of the heavens,",
  "38": "When the dust hardens into a mass And the clods stick together?",
  "39": "\"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,",
  "40": "When they crouch in their dens And lie in wait in their lair?",
  "41": "\"Who prepares for the raven its nourishment When its young cry to God And wander about without food?"
