  "5": "Then he ran to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he said, \"I did not call, lie down again.\" So he went and lay down.",
  "6": "The LORD called yet again, \"Samuel!\" So Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he answered, \"I did not call, my son, lie down again.\"",

  "8": "So the LORD called Samuel again for the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" Then Eli discerned that the LORD was calling the boy.",
  "9": "And Eli said to Samuel, \"Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.'\" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
  "10": "Then the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" And Samuel said, \"Speak, for Your servant is listening.\"",

  "13": "\"For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.",
  "14": "\"Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.\"",

  "18": "So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, \"It is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.\"",
  "19": "Thus Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fail.",
  "20": "All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.",
  "21": "And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, because the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD."
