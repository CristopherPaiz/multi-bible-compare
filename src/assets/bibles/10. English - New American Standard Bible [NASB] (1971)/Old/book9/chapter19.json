  "5": "\"For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause?\"",

  "16": "When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats' hair at its head.",
  "17": "So Saul said to Michal, \"Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?\" And Michal said to Saul, \"He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I put you to death?'\"",
