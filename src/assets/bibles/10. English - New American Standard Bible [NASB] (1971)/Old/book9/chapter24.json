  "3": "He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave.",
  "4": "The men of David said to him, \"Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'\" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly.",

  "20": "\"Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.",
