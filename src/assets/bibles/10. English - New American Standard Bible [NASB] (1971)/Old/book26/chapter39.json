  "11": "\"On that day I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block off those who would pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will call it the valley of Hamon-gog.",

  "15": "\"As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man's bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.",
  "16": "\"And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land.\"'",
  "17": "\"As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field, \"Assemble and come, gather from every side to My sacrifice which I am going to sacrifice for you, as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.",
  "18": "\"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.",
  "19": "\"So you will eat fat until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.",

  "28": "\"Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer.",
  "29": "\"I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,\" declares the Lord GOD."
