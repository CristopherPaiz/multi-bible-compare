  "1": "Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,",
  "2": "\"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, 'Listen to the word of the LORD!",
  "3": "'Thus says the Lord GOD, \"Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing.",
  "4": "\"O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins.",
  "5": "\"You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the LORD.",
  "6": "\"They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying, 'The LORD declares,' when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word.",
  "7": "\"Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, 'The LORD declares,' but it is not I who have spoken?\"'\"",
  "8": "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, \"Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you,\" declares the Lord GOD.",
  "9": "\"So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord GOD.",
  "10": "\"It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, 'Peace!' when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash;",
  "11": "so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break out.",
  "12": "\"Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, 'Where is the plaster with which you plastered it?'\"",
  "13": "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, \"I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume it in wrath.",
  "14": "\"So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is laid bare; and when it falls, you will be consumed in its midst. And you will know that I am the LORD.",
  "15": "\"Thus I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,",
  "16": "along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,' declares the Lord GOD.",
  "17": "\"Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration. Prophesy against them",
  "18": "and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, \"Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down the lives of My people, but preserve the lives of others for yourselves?",
  "19": "\"For handfuls of barley and fragments of bread, you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.\"'\"",
  "20": "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, \"Behold, I am against your magic bands by which you hunt lives there as birds and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let them go, even those lives whom you hunt as birds.",
  "21": "\"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD.",
  "22": "\"Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life,",
  "23": "therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination, and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.\""
