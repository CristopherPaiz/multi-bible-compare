  "1": "\"For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,",
  "2": "I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land.",
  "3": "\"They have also cast lots for My people, Traded a boy for a harlot And sold a girl for wine that they may drink.",
  "4": "\"Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head.",
  "5": "\"Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures to your temples,",
  "6": "and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory,",
  "7": "behold, I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and return your recompense on your head.",
  "8": "\"Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation,\" for the LORD has spoken.",
  "9": "Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare a war; rouse the mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up!",
  "10": "Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, \"I am a mighty man.\"",
  "11": "Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones.",
  "12": "Let the nations be aroused And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations.",
  "13": "Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.",
  "14": "Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.",
  "15": "The sun and moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness.",
  "16": "The LORD roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth tremble. But the LORD is a refuge for His people And a stronghold to the sons of Israel.",
  "17": "Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. So Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers will pass through it no more.",
  "18": "And in that day The mountains will drip with sweet wine, And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD To water the valley of Shittim.",
  "19": "Egypt will become a waste, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood.",
  "20": "But Judah will be inhabited forever And Jerusalem for all generations.",
  "21": "And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion."
