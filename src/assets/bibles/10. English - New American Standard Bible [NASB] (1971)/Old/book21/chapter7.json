  "3": "Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.",
  "4": "The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.",
  "5": "It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools.",
  "6": "For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool; And this too is futility.",
  "7": "For oppression makes a wise man mad, And a bribe corrupts the heart.",

  "11": "Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun.",
  "12": "For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.",

  "19": "Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.",

  "27": "\"Behold, I have discovered this,\" says the Preacher, \"adding one thing to another to find an explanation,",

  "29": "\"Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices.\""
