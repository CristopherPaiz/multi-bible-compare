  "1": "The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.",
  "2": "\"Vanity of vanities,\" says the Preacher, \"Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.\"",
  "3": "What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun?",
  "4": "A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever.",
  "5": "Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again.",
  "6": "Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns.",
  "7": "All the rivers flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again.",
  "8": "All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing.",
  "9": "That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun.",
  "10": "Is there anything of which one might say, \"See this, it is new\"? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us.",
  "11": "There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur, There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later still.",
  "12": "I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
  "13": "And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.",
  "14": "I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.",
  "15": "What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.",
  "16": "I said to myself, \"Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.\"",
  "17": "And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.",
  "18": "Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain."
