  "16": "They answered Joshua, saying, \"All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.",
  "17": "\"Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses.",
  "18": "\"Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous.\""
