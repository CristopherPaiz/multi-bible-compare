  "1": "Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice?",
  "2": "On top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;",
  "3": "Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:",
  "4": "\"To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.",
  "5": "\"O naive ones, understand prudence; And, O fools, understand wisdom.",
  "6": "\"Listen, for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips will reveal right things.",
  "7": "\"For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.",
  "8": "\"All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.",
  "9": "\"They are all straightforward to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.",
  "10": "\"Take my instruction and not silver, And knowledge rather than choicest gold.",
  "11": "\"For wisdom is better than jewels; And all desirable things cannot compare with her.",
  "12": "\"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And I find knowledge and discretion.",
  "13": "\"The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverted mouth, I hate.",
  "14": "\"Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.",
  "15": "\"By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice.",
  "16": "\"By me princes rule, and nobles, All who judge rightly.",
  "17": "\"I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me will find me.",
  "18": "\"Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness.",
  "19": "\"My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield better than choicest silver.",
  "20": "\"I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice,",
  "21": "To endow those who love me with wealth, That I may fill their treasuries.",
  "22": "\"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old.",
  "23": "\"From everlasting I was established, From the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.",
  "24": "\"When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no springs abounding with water.",
  "25": "\"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills I was brought forth;",
  "26": "While He had not yet made the earth and the fields, Nor the first dust of the world.",
  "27": "\"When He established the heavens, I was there, When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,",
  "28": "When He made firm the skies above, When the springs of the deep became fixed,",
  "29": "When He set for the sea its boundary So that the water would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth;",
  "30": "Then I was beside Him, as a master workman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,",
  "31": "Rejoicing in the world, His earth, And having my delight in the sons of men.",
  "32": "\"Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, For blessed are they who keep my ways.",
  "33": "\"Heed instruction and be wise, And do not neglect it.",
  "34": "\"Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.",
  "35": "\"For he who finds me finds life And obtains favor from the LORD.",
  "36": "\"But he who sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love death.\""
