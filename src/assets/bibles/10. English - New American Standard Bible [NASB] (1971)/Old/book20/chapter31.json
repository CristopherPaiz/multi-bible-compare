  "3": "Do not give your strength to women, Or your ways to that which destroys kings.",
  "4": "It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire strong drink,",
  "5": "For they will drink and forget what is decreed, And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.",

  "7": "Let him drink and forget his poverty And remember his trouble no more.",

  "11": "The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain.",
  "12": "She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.",
  "13": "She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight.",
  "14": "She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar.",
  "15": "She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens.",
  "16": "She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard.",
  "17": "She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong.",
  "18": "She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night.",
  "19": "She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle.",

  "21": "She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.",
  "22": "She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.",
  "23": "Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.",

  "28": "Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he praises her, saying:",
  "29": "\"Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all.\"",
  "30": "Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.",
  "31": "Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates."
