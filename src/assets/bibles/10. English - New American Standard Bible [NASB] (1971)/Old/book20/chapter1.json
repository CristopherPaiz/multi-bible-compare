  "1": "The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:",
  "2": "To know wisdom and instruction, To discern the sayings of understanding,",
  "3": "To receive instruction in wise behavior, Righteousness, justice and equity;",
  "4": "To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and discretion,",
  "5": "A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel,",
  "6": "To understand a proverb and a figure, The words of the wise and their riddles.",
  "7": "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
  "8": "Hear, my son, your father's instruction And do not forsake your mother's teaching;",
  "9": "Indeed, they are a graceful wreath to your head And ornaments about your neck.",
  "10": "My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.",
  "11": "If they say, \"Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause;",
  "12": "Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who go down to the pit;",
  "13": "We will find all kinds of precious wealth, We will fill our houses with spoil;",
  "14": "Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have one purse,\"",
  "15": "My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path,",
  "16": "For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood.",
  "17": "Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net In the sight of any bird;",
  "18": "But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their own lives.",
  "19": "So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the life of its possessors.",
  "20": "Wisdom shouts in the street, She lifts her voice in the square;",
  "21": "At the head of the noisy streets she cries out; At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:",
  "22": "\"How long, O naive ones, will you love being simple-minded? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing And fools hate knowledge?",
  "23": "\"Turn to my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.",
  "24": "\"Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention;",
  "25": "And you neglected all my counsel And did not want my reproof;",
  "26": "I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes,",
  "27": "When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.",
  "28": "\"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently but they will not find me,",
  "29": "Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD.",
  "30": "\"They would not accept my counsel, They spurned all my reproof.",
  "31": "\"So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way And be satiated with their own devices.",
  "32": "\"For the waywardness of the naive will kill them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them.",
  "33": "\"But he who listens to me shall live securely And will be at ease from the dread of evil.\""
