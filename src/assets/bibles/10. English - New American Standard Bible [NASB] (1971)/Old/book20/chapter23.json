  "1": "When you sit down to dine with a ruler, Consider carefully what is before you,",
  "2": "And put a knife to your throat If you are a man of great appetite.",
  "3": "Do not desire his delicacies, For it is deceptive food.",
  "4": "Do not weary yourself to gain wealth, Cease from your consideration of it.",
  "5": "When you set your eyes on it, it is gone. For wealth certainly makes itself wings Like an eagle that flies toward the heavens.",
  "6": "Do not eat the bread of a selfish man, Or desire his delicacies;",
  "7": "For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, \"Eat and drink!\" But his heart is not with you.",
  "8": "You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten, And waste your compliments.",
  "9": "Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words.",
  "10": "Do not move the ancient boundary Or go into the fields of the fatherless,",
  "11": "For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their case against you.",
  "12": "Apply your heart to discipline And your ears to words of knowledge.",
  "13": "Do not hold back discipline from the child, Although you strike him with the rod, he will not die.",
  "14": "You shall strike him with the rod And rescue his soul from Sheol.",
  "15": "My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be glad;",
  "16": "And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is right.",
  "17": "Do not let your heart envy sinners, But live in the fear of the LORD always.",
  "18": "Surely there is a future, And your hope will not be cut off.",
  "19": "Listen, my son, and be wise, And direct your heart in the way.",
  "20": "Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine, Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;",
  "21": "For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe one with rags.",
  "22": "Listen to your father who begot you, And do not despise your mother when she is old.",
  "23": "Buy truth, and do not sell it, Get wisdom and instruction and understanding.",
  "24": "The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who sires a wise son will be glad in him.",
  "25": "Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her rejoice who gave birth to you.",
  "26": "Give me your heart, my son, And let your eyes delight in my ways.",
  "27": "For a harlot is a deep pit And an adulterous woman is a narrow well.",
  "28": "Surely she lurks as a robber, And increases the faithless among men.",
  "29": "Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?",
  "30": "Those who linger long over wine, Those who go to taste mixed wine.",
  "31": "Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, When it goes down smoothly;",
  "32": "At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.",
  "33": "Your eyes will see strange things And your mind will utter perverse things.",
  "34": "And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea, Or like one who lies down on the top of a mast.",
  "35": "\"They struck me, but I did not become ill; They beat me, but I did not know it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink.\""
