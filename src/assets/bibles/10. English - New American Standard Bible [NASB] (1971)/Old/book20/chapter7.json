  "1": "My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you.",
  "2": "Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye.",
  "3": "Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.",
  "4": "Say to wisdom, \"You are my sister,\" And call understanding your intimate friend;",
  "5": "That they may keep you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.",
  "6": "For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,",
  "7": "And I saw among the naive, And discerned among the youths A young man lacking sense,",
  "8": "Passing through the street near her corner; And he takes the way to her house,",
  "9": "In the twilight, in the evening, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.",
  "10": "And behold, a woman comes to meet him, Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.",
  "11": "She is boisterous and rebellious, Her feet do not remain at home;",
  "12": "She is now in the streets, now in the squares, And lurks by every corner.",
  "13": "So she seizes him and kisses him And with a brazen face she says to him:",
  "14": "\"I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows.",
  "15": "\"Therefore I have come out to meet you, To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you.",
  "16": "\"I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of Egypt.",
  "17": "\"I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.",
  "18": "\"Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses.",
  "19": "\"For my husband is not at home, He has gone on a long journey;",
  "20": "He has taken a bag of money with him, At the full moon he will come home.\"",
  "21": "With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering lips she seduces him.",
  "22": "Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool,",
  "23": "Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it will cost him his life.",
  "24": "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth.",
  "25": "Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths.",
  "26": "For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are all her slain.",
  "27": "Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death."
