  "1": "My son, give attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my understanding;",
  "2": "That you may observe discretion And your lips may reserve knowledge.",
  "3": "For the lips of an adulteress drip honey And smoother than oil is her speech;",
  "4": "But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol.",
  "6": "She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable, she does not know it.",
  "7": "Now then, my sons, listen to me And do not depart from the words of my mouth.",
  "8": "Keep your way far from her And do not go near the door of her house,",
  "9": "Or you will give your vigor to others And your years to the cruel one;",
  "10": "And strangers will be filled with your strength And your hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien;",
  "11": "And you groan at your final end, When your flesh and your body are consumed;",
  "12": "And you say, \"How I have hated instruction! And my heart spurned reproof!",
  "13": "\"I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to my instructors!",
  "14": "\"I was almost in utter ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation.\"",
  "15": "Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your own well.",
  "16": "Should your springs be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets?",
  "17": "Let them be yours alone And not for strangers with you.",
  "18": "Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your youth.",
  "19": "As a loving hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be exhilarated always with her love.",
  "20": "For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?",
  "21": "For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He watches all his paths.",
  "22": "His own iniquities will capture the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.",
  "23": "He will die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray."
