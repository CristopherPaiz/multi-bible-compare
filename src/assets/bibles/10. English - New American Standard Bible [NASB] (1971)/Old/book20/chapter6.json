  "1": "My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, Have given a pledge for a stranger,",
  "2": "If you have been snared with the words of your mouth, Have been caught with the words of your mouth,",
  "3": "Do this then, my son, and deliver yourself; Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor, Go, humble yourself, and importune your neighbor.",
  "4": "Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;",
  "5": "Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter's hand And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, O sluggard, Observe her ways and be wise,",
  "7": "Which, having no chief, Officer or ruler,",
  "8": "Prepares her food in the summer And gathers her provision in the harvest.",
  "9": "How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?",
  "10": "\"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest\"--",
  "11": "Your poverty will come in like a vagabond And your need like an armed man.",
  "12": "A worthless person, a wicked man, Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth,",
  "13": "Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who points with his fingers;",
  "14": "Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil, Who spreads strife.",
  "15": "Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing.",
  "16": "There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him:",
  "17": "Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood,",
  "18": "A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to evil,",
  "19": "A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.",
  "20": "My son, observe the commandment of your father And do not forsake the teaching of your mother;",
  "21": "Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them around your neck.",
  "22": "When you walk about, they will guide you; When you sleep, they will watch over you; And when you awake, they will talk to you.",
  "23": "For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; And reproofs for discipline are the way of life",
  "24": "To keep you from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.",
  "25": "Do not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her capture you with her eyelids.",
  "26": "For on account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread, And an adulteress hunts for the precious life.",
  "27": "Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?",
  "28": "Or can a man walk on hot coals And his feet not be scorched?",
  "29": "So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.",
  "30": "Men do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry;",
  "31": "But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold; He must give all the substance of his house.",
  "32": "The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He who would destroy himself does it.",
  "33": "Wounds and disgrace he will find, And his reproach will not be blotted out.",
  "34": "For jealousy enrages a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.",
  "35": "He will not accept any ransom, Nor will he be satisfied though you give many gifts."
