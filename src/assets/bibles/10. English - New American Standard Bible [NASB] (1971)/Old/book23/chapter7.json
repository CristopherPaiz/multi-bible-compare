  "2": "When it was reported to the house of David, saying, \"The Arameans have camped in Ephraim,\" his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind.",

  "4": "and say to him, 'Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.",
  "5": "'Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying,",
  "6": "\"Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,\"",
  "7": "thus says the Lord GOD: \"It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass.",
  "8": "\"For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another 65 years Ephraim will be shattered, so that it is no longer a people),",
  "9": "and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you surely shall not last.\"'\"",
  "10": "Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,",
  "11": "\"Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\"",

  "19": "They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes and on all the watering places.",
  "20": "In that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard.",
