  "5": "\"For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is the LORD of hosts; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of all the earth.",

  "12": "\"Moreover, I will make your battlements of rubies, And your gates of crystal, And your entire wall of precious stones.",
  "13": "\"All your sons will be taught of the LORD; And the well-being of your sons will be great.",
  "14": "\"In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you.",
  "15": "\"If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me. Whoever assails you will fall because of you.",
  "16": "\"Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals And brings out a weapon for its work; And I have created the destroyer to ruin.",
  "17": "\"No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,\" declares the LORD."
