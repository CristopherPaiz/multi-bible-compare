  "1": "Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their images are consigned to the beasts and the cattle. The things that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary beast.",
  "2": "They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity.",
  "3": "\"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth And have been carried from the womb;",
  "4": "Even to your old age I will be the same, And even to your graying years I will bear you! I have done it, and I will carry you; And I will bear you and I will deliver you.",
  "5": "\"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal and compare Me, That we would be alike?",
  "6": "\"Those who lavish gold from the purse And weigh silver on the scale Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it.",
  "7": "\"They lift it upon the shoulder and carry it; They set it in its place and it stands there. It does not move from its place. Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer; It cannot deliver him from his distress.",
  "8": "\"Remember this, and be assured; Recall it to mind, you transgressors.",
  "9": "\"Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,",
  "10": "Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure';",
  "11": "Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, surely I will do it.",
  "12": "\"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness.",
  "13": "\"I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, And My glory for Israel."
