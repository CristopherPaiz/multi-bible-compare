  "5": "Who inflame yourselves among the oaks, Under every luxuriant tree, Who slaughter the children in the ravines, Under the clefts of the crags?",
  "6": "\"Among the smooth stones of the ravine Is your portion, they are your lot; Even to them you have poured out a drink offering, You have made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things?",

  "16": "\"For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For the spirit would grow faint before Me, And the breath of those whom I have made.",
  "17": "\"Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him; I hid My face and was angry, And he went on turning away, in the way of his heart.",
  "18": "\"I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners,",
  "19": "Creating the praise of the lips. Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near,\" Says the LORD, \"and I will heal him.\"",
