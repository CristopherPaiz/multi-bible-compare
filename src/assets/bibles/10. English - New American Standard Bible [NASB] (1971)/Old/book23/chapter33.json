  "1": "Woe to you, O destroyer, While you were not destroyed; And he who is treacherous, while others did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you.",
  "2": "O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their strength every morning, Our salvation also in the time of distress.",
  "3": "At the sound of the tumult peoples flee; At the lifting up of Yourself nations disperse.",
  "4": "Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; As locusts rushing about men rush about on it.",
  "5": "The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.",
  "6": "And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.",
  "7": "Behold, their brave men cry in the streets, The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.",
  "8": "The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased, He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, He has no regard for man.",
  "9": "The land mourns and pines away, Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a desert plain, And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage.",
  "10": "\"Now I will arise,\" says the LORD, \"Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up.",
  "11": "\"You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire.",
  "12": "\"The peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire.",
  "13": "\"You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might.\"",
  "14": "Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. \"Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with continual burning?\"",
  "15": "He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, He who rejects unjust gain And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil;",
  "16": "He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given him, His water will be sure.",
  "17": "Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will behold a far-distant land.",
  "18": "Your heart will meditate on terror: \"Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?\"",
  "19": "You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue which no one understands.",
  "20": "Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed habitation, A tent which will not be folded; Its stakes will never be pulled up, Nor any of its cords be torn apart.",
  "21": "But there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us A place of rivers and wide canals On which no boat with oars will go, And on which no mighty ship will pass--",
  "22": "For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us--",
  "23": "Your tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; The lame will take the plunder.",
  "24": "And no resident will say, \"I am sick\"; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity."
