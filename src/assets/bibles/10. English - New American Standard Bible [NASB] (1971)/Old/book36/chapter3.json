  "10": "\"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings.",

  "13": "\"The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble.\"",
  "14": "Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!",
  "15": "The LORD has taken away His judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will fear disaster no more.",
  "16": "In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: \"Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp.",

  "18": "\"I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts--They came from you, O Zion; The reproach of exile is a burden on them.",
  "19": "\"Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors, I will save the lame And gather the outcast, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In all the earth.",
  "20": "\"At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will give you renown and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes,\" Says the LORD."
