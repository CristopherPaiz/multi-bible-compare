  "1": "The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; Strengthen your back, summon all your strength.",
  "2": "For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though devastators have devastated them And destroyed their vine branches.",
  "3": "The shields of his mighty men are colored red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are enveloped in flashing steel When he is prepared to march, And the cypress spears are brandished.",
