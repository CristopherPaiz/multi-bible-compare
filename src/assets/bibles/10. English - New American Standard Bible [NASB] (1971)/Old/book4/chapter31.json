  "39": "and the donkeys were 30,500, from which the LORD'S levy was 61;",
  "40": "and the human beings were 16,000, from whom the LORD'S levy was 32 persons.",
  "41": "Moses gave the levy which was the LORD'S offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",

  "48": "Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses,",
  "49": "and they said to Moses, \"Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.",
  "50": "\"So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.\"",
