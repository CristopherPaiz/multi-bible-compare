  "19": "or a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,",
  "20": "or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles.",
  "21": "'No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to offer the LORD'S offerings by fire; since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God.",
  "22": "'He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy,",
  "23": "only he shall not go in to the veil or come near the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'\"",
  "24": "So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel."
