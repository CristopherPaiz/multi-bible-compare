  "1": "How dark the gold has become, How the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are poured out At the corner of every street.",
  "2": "The precious sons of Zion, Weighed against fine gold, How they are regarded as earthen jars, The work of a potter's hands!",
  "3": "Even jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; But the daughter of my people has become cruel Like ostriches in the wilderness.",
  "4": "The tongue of the infant cleaves To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The little ones ask for bread, But no one breaks it for them.",
  "5": "Those who ate delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those reared in purple Embrace ash pits.",
  "6": "For the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, And no hands were turned toward her.",
  "7": "Her consecrated ones were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than corals, Their polishing was like lapis lazuli.",
  "8": "Their appearance is blacker than soot, They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin is shriveled on their bones, It is withered, it has become like wood.",
  "9": "Better are those slain with the sword Than those slain with hunger; For they pine away, being stricken For lack of the fruits of the field.",
  "10": "The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.",
  "11": "The LORD has accomplished His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger; And He has kindled a fire in Zion Which has consumed its foundations.",

  "14": "They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments.",
  "15": "\"Depart! Unclean!\" they cried of themselves. \"Depart, depart, do not touch!\" So they fled and wandered; Men among the nations said, \"They shall not continue to dwell with us.\"",
  "16": "The presence of the LORD has scattered them, He will not continue to regard them; They did not honor the priests, They did not favor the elders.",
  "17": "Yet our eyes failed, Looking for help was useless; In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save.",
  "18": "They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come.",
  "19": "Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky; They chased us on the mountains, They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.",
  "20": "The breath of our nostrils, the LORD'S anointed, Was captured in their pits, Of whom we had said, \"Under his shadow We shall live among the nations.\"",
  "21": "Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the land of Uz; But the cup will come around to you as well, You will become drunk and make yourself naked.",
  "22": "The punishment of your iniquity has been completed, O daughter of Zion; He will exile you no longer. But He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins!"
