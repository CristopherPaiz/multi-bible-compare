  "3": "Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.",

  "10": "Therefore she said to Abraham, \"Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.\"",
  "11": "The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.",
  "12": "But God said to Abraham, \"Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named.",
  "13": "\"And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.\"",
  "14": "So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.",

  "18": "\"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.\"",
  "19": "Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.",
  "20": "God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.",
  "21": "He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.",
  "22": "Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, \"God is with you in all that you do;",
  "23": "now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.\"",
  "24": "Abraham said, \"I swear it.\"",
