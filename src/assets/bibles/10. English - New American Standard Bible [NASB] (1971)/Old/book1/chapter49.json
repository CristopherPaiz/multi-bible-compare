  "4": "\"Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled it--he went up to my couch.",
  "5": "\"Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are implements of violence.",
  "6": "\"Let my soul not enter into their council; Let not my glory be united with their assembly; Because in their anger they slew men, And in their self-will they lamed oxen.",

  "17": "\"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.",
  "18": "\"For Your salvation I wait, O LORD.",
  "19": "\"As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he will raid at their heels.",
  "20": "\"As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he will yield royal dainties.",
  "21": "\"Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words.",
  "22": "\"Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; Its branches run over a wall.",
  "23": "\"The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot at him and harassed him;",
  "24": "But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),",

  "31": "\"There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah--",
  "32": "the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth.\"",
