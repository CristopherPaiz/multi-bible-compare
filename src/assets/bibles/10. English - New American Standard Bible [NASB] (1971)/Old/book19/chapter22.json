  "14": "I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.",
  "15": "My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And my tongue cleaves to my jaws; And You lay me in the dust of death.",

  "24": "For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from him; But when he cried to Him for help, He heard.",
  "25": "From You comes my praise in the great assembly; I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him.",
  "26": "The afflicted will eat and be satisfied; Those who seek Him will praise the LORD. Let your heart live forever!",
  "27": "All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, And all the families of the nations will worship before You.",
  "28": "For the kingdom is the LORD'S And He rules over the nations.",
