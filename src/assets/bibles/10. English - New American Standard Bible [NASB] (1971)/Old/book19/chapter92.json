  "1": "It is good to give thanks to the LORD And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;",
  "2": "To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning And Your faithfulness by night,",

  "4": "For You, O LORD, have made me glad by what You have done, I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.",
  "5": "How great are Your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep.",
  "6": "A senseless man has no knowledge, Nor does a stupid man understand this:",
  "7": "That when the wicked sprouted up like grass And all who did iniquity flourished, It was only that they might be destroyed forevermore.",
  "8": "But You, O LORD, are on high forever.",
  "9": "For, behold, Your enemies, O LORD, For, behold, Your enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered.",
  "10": "But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.",
  "11": "And my eye has looked exultantly upon my foes, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.",
  "12": "The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.",
  "13": "Planted in the house of the LORD, They will flourish in the courts of our God.",
  "14": "They will still yield fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and very green,",
  "15": "To declare that the LORD is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him."
