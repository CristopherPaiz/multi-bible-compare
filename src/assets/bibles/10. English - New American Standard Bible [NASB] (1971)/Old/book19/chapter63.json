  "1": "O God, You are my God; I shall seek You earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is no water.",
  "2": "Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory.",
  "3": "Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips will praise You.",
  "4": "So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.",
  "5": "My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.",
  "6": "When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches,",
  "7": "For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.",
  "8": "My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.",
  "9": "But those who seek my life to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth.",
  "10": "They will be delivered over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes.",
  "11": "But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will glory, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped."
