  "1": "Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain.",
  "2": "It is vain for you to rise up early, To retire late, To eat the bread of painful labors; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep.",
  "3": "Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth.",
  "5": "How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate."
