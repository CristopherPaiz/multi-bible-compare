  "1": "O LORD, I call upon You; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to You!",
  "2": "May my prayer be counted as incense before You; The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.",
  "3": "Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice deeds of wickedness With men who do iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.",
  "5": "Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me; It is oil upon the head; Do not let my head refuse it, For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.",
  "6": "Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, And they hear my words, for they are pleasant.",
  "7": "As when one plows and breaks open the earth, Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.",
  "8": "For my eyes are toward You, O GOD, the Lord; In You I take refuge; do not leave me defenseless.",
  "9": "Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, And from the snares of those who do iniquity.",
  "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I pass by safely."
