  "6": "That the generation to come might know, even the children yet to be born, That they may arise and tell them to their children,",
  "7": "That they should put their confidence in God And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments,",
  "8": "And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not prepare its heart And whose spirit was not faithful to God.",

  "12": "He wrought wonders before their fathers In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.",
  "13": "He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap.",
  "14": "Then He led them with the cloud by day And all the night with a light of fire.",
  "15": "He split the rocks in the wilderness And gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths.",
  "16": "He brought forth streams also from the rock And caused waters to run down like rivers.",
  "17": "Yet they still continued to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.",

  "19": "Then they spoke against God; They said, \"Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?",
  "20": "\"Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, And streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?\"",
  "21": "Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath; And a fire was kindled against Jacob And anger also mounted against Israel,",
  "22": "Because they did not believe in God And did not trust in His salvation.",
  "23": "Yet He commanded the clouds above And opened the doors of heaven;",
  "24": "He rained down manna upon them to eat And gave them food from heaven.",
  "25": "Man did eat the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.",
  "26": "He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens And by His power He directed the south wind.",
  "27": "When He rained meat upon them like the dust, Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,",

  "35": "And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer.",
  "36": "But they deceived Him with their mouth And lied to Him with their tongue.",
  "37": "For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant.",
  "38": "But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them; And often He restrained His anger And did not arouse all His wrath.",
  "39": "Thus He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes and does not return.",
  "40": "How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness And grieved Him in the desert!",
  "41": "Again and again they tempted God, And pained the Holy One of Israel.",
  "42": "They did not remember His power, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,",

  "52": "But He led forth His own people like sheep And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;",
  "53": "He led them safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea engulfed their enemies.",
  "54": "So He brought them to His holy land, To this hill country which His right hand had gained.",
  "55": "He also drove out the nations before them And apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.",
  "56": "Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies,",
  "57": "But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; They turned aside like a treacherous bow.",
  "58": "For they provoked Him with their high places And aroused His jealousy with their graven images.",

  "60": "So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, The tent which He had pitched among men,",
  "61": "And gave up His strength to captivity And His glory into the hand of the adversary.",
