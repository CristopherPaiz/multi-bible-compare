  "1": "Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty,",
  "2": "Covering Yourself with light as with a cloak, Stretching out heaven like a tent curtain.",
  "3": "He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks upon the wings of the wind;",
  "4": "He makes the winds His messengers, Flaming fire His ministers.",
  "5": "He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever.",
  "6": "You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains.",
  "7": "At Your rebuke they fled, At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.",
  "8": "The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which You established for them.",
  "9": "You set a boundary that they may not pass over, So that they will not return to cover the earth.",
  "10": "He sends forth springs in the valleys; They flow between the mountains;",
  "11": "They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst.",
  "12": "Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; They lift up their voices among the branches.",
  "13": "He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.",
  "14": "He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the labor of man, So that he may bring forth food from the earth,",
  "15": "And wine which makes man's heart glad, So that he may make his face glisten with oil, And food which sustains man's heart.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD drink their fill, The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,",
  "17": "Where the birds build their nests, And the stork, whose home is the fir trees.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; The cliffs are a refuge for the shephanim.",
  "19": "He made the moon for the seasons; The sun knows the place of its setting.",
  "20": "You appoint darkness and it becomes night, In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about.",
  "21": "The young lions roar after their prey And seek their food from God.",
  "22": "When the sun rises they withdraw And lie down in their dens.",
  "23": "Man goes forth to his work And to his labor until evening.",
  "24": "O LORD, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all; The earth is full of Your possessions.",
  "25": "There is the sea, great and broad, In which are swarms without number, Animals both small and great.",
  "26": "There the ships move along, And Leviathan, which You have formed to sport in it.",
  "27": "They all wait for You To give them their food in due season.",
  "28": "You give to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.",
  "29": "You hide Your face, they are dismayed; You take away their spirit, they expire And return to their dust.",
  "30": "You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the ground.",
  "31": "Let the glory of the LORD endure forever; Let the LORD be glad in His works;",
  "32": "He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.",
  "34": "Let my meditation be pleasing to Him; As for me, I shall be glad in the LORD.",
  "35": "Let sinners be consumed from the earth And let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!"
