  "1": "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!",
  "2": "But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.",
  "3": "He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.",
  "4": "The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away.",
  "5": "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.",
  "6": "For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish."
