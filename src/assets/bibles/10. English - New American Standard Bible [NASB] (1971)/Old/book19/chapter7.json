  "1": "O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,",
  "2": "Or he will tear my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is none to deliver.",
  "3": "O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands,",
  "4": "If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary,",
  "5": "Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; And let him trample my life down to the ground And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.",
  "6": "Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And arouse Yourself for me; You have appointed judgment.",
  "7": "Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You, And over them return on high.",
  "8": "The LORD judges the peoples; Vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me.",
  "9": "O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.",
  "10": "My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.",
  "11": "God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day.",
  "12": "If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.",
  "13": "He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.",
  "14": "Behold, he travails with wickedness, And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.",
  "15": "He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made.",
  "16": "His mischief will return upon his own head, And his violence will descend upon his own pate.",
  "17": "I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High."
