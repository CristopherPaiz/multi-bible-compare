  "1": "The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; Whom shall I dread?",
  "2": "When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.",
  "3": "Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear; Though war arise against me, In spite of this I shall be confident.",
  "4": "One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD And to meditate in His temple.",
  "5": "For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me; He will lift me up on a rock.",
  "6": "And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me, And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.",
  "7": "Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, And be gracious to me and answer me.",
  "8": "When You said, \"Seek My face,\" my heart said to You, \"Your face, O LORD, I shall seek.\"",
  "9": "Do not hide Your face from me, Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not abandon me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation!",
  "10": "For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the LORD will take me up.",
  "11": "Teach me Your way, O LORD, And lead me in a level path Because of my foes.",
  "12": "Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence.",
  "13": "I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living.",
  "14": "Wait for the LORD; Be strong and let your heart take courage; Yes, wait for the LORD."
