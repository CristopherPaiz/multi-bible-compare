  "1": "O God of my praise, Do not be silent!",
  "2": "For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me; They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.",
  "3": "They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, And fought against me without cause.",
  "4": "In return for my love they act as my accusers; But I am in prayer.",
  "5": "Thus they have repaid me evil for good And hatred for my love.",
  "6": "Appoint a wicked man over him, And let an accuser stand at his right hand.",
  "7": "When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, And let his prayer become sin.",
  "8": "Let his days be few; Let another take his office.",
  "9": "Let his children be fatherless And his wife a widow.",
  "10": "Let his children wander about and beg; And let them seek sustenance far from their ruined homes.",
  "11": "Let the creditor seize all that he has, And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.",
  "12": "Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him, Nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children.",
  "13": "Let his posterity be cut off; In a following generation let their name be blotted out.",
  "14": "Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.",
  "15": "Let them be before the LORD continually, That He may cut off their memory from the earth;",
  "16": "Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, But persecuted the afflicted and needy man, And the despondent in heart, to put them to death.",
  "17": "He also loved cursing, so it came to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him.",
  "18": "But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, And it entered into his body like water And like oil into his bones.",
  "19": "Let it be to him as a garment with which he covers himself, And for a belt with which he constantly girds himself.",
  "20": "Let this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, And of those who speak evil against my soul.",
  "21": "But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for Your name's sake; Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me;",
  "22": "For I am afflicted and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.",
  "23": "I am passing like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like the locust.",
  "24": "My knees are weak from fasting, And my flesh has grown lean, without fatness.",
  "25": "I also have become a reproach to them; When they see me, they wag their head.",
  "26": "Help me, O LORD my God; Save me according to Your lovingkindness.",
  "27": "And let them know that this is Your hand; You, LORD, have done it.",
  "28": "Let them curse, but You bless; When they arise, they shall be ashamed, But Your servant shall be glad.",
  "29": "Let my accusers be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.",
  "30": "With my mouth I will give thanks abundantly to the LORD; And in the midst of many I will praise Him.",
  "31": "For He stands at the right hand of the needy, To save him from those who judge his soul."
