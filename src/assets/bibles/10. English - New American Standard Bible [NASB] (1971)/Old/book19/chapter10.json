  "1": "Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?",
  "2": "In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.",
  "3": "For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the greedy man curses and spurns the LORD.",
  "4": "The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek Him. All his thoughts are, \"There is no God.\"",
  "5": "His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.",
  "6": "He says to himself, \"I will not be moved; Throughout all generations I will not be in adversity.\"",
  "7": "His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.",
  "8": "He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the hiding places he kills the innocent; His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate.",
  "9": "He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the afflicted; He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.",
  "10": "He crouches, he bows down, And the unfortunate fall by his mighty ones.",
  "11": "He says to himself, \"God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it.\"",
  "12": "Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Your hand. Do not forget the afflicted.",
  "13": "Why has the wicked spurned God? He has said to himself, \"You will not require it.\"",
  "14": "You have seen it, for You have beheld mischief and vexation to take it into Your hand. The unfortunate commits himself to You; You have been the helper of the orphan.",
  "15": "Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until You find none.",
  "16": "The LORD is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land.",
  "17": "O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear",
  "18": "To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, So that man who is of the earth will no longer cause terror."
