  "1": "Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.",
  "2": "Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the LORD, Or can show forth all His praise?",
  "3": "How blessed are those who keep justice, Who practice righteousness at all times!",
  "4": "Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor toward Your people; Visit me with Your salvation,",
  "5": "That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, That I may glory with Your inheritance.",
  "6": "We have sinned like our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly.",
  "7": "Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your abundant kindnesses, But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.",
  "8": "Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, That He might make His power known.",
  "9": "Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up, And He led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness.",
  "10": "So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.",
  "11": "The waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left.",
  "12": "Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.",
  "13": "They quickly forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,",
  "14": "But craved intensely in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.",
  "15": "So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease among them.",
  "16": "When they became envious of Moses in the camp, And of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,",
  "17": "The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And engulfed the company of Abiram.",
  "18": "And a fire blazed up in their company; The flame consumed the wicked.",
  "19": "They made a calf in Horeb And worshiped a molten image.",
  "20": "Thus they exchanged their glory For the image of an ox that eats grass.",
  "21": "They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,",
  "22": "Wonders in the land of Ham And awesome things by the Red Sea.",
  "23": "Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him, To turn away His wrath from destroying them.",
  "24": "Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe in His word,",
  "25": "But grumbled in their tents; They did not listen to the voice of the LORD.",
  "26": "Therefore He swore to them That He would cast them down in the wilderness,",
  "27": "And that He would cast their seed among the nations And scatter them in the lands.",
  "28": "They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.",
  "29": "Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them.",
  "30": "Then Phinehas stood up and interposed, And so the plague was stayed.",
  "31": "And it was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forever.",
  "32": "They also provoked Him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, So that it went hard with Moses on their account;",
  "33": "Because they were rebellious against His Spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips.",
  "34": "They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them,",
  "35": "But they mingled with the nations And learned their practices,",
  "36": "And served their idols, Which became a snare to them.",
  "37": "They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons,",
  "38": "And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with the blood.",
  "39": "Thus they became unclean in their practices, And played the harlot in their deeds.",
  "40": "Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people And He abhorred His inheritance.",
  "41": "Then He gave them into the hand of the nations, And those who hated them ruled over them.",
  "42": "Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were subdued under their power.",
  "43": "Many times He would deliver them; They, however, were rebellious in their counsel, And so sank down in their iniquity.",
  "44": "Nevertheless He looked upon their distress When He heard their cry;",
  "45": "And He remembered His covenant for their sake, And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.",
  "46": "He also made them objects of compassion In the presence of all their captors.",
  "47": "Save us, O LORD our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name And glory in Your praise.",
  "48": "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, \"Amen.\" Praise the LORD!"
