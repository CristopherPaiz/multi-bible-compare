  "1": "O LORD, You have searched me and known me.",
  "2": "You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my thought from afar.",
  "3": "You scrutinize my path and my lying down, And are intimately acquainted with all my ways.",
  "4": "Even before there is a word on my tongue, Behold, O LORD, You know it all.",
  "5": "You have enclosed me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me.",

  "7": "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?",
  "8": "If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.",
  "9": "If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,",

  "17": "How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!",
  "18": "If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.",
  "19": "O that You would slay the wicked, O God; Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.",
  "20": "For they speak against You wickedly, And Your enemies take Your name in vain.",
  "21": "Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?",
  "22": "I hate them with the utmost hatred; They have become my enemies.",
  "23": "Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts;",
  "24": "And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way."
