  "1": "O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?",
  "2": "He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.",
  "3": "He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;",
  "4": "In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt and does not change;",
  "5": "He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken."
