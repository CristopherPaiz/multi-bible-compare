  "1": "Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.",
  "2": "Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity,",
  "3": "Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech as their arrow,",
  "4": "To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.",
  "5": "They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, \"Who can see them?\"",
  "6": "They devise injustices, saying, \"We are ready with a well-conceived plot\"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.",
  "7": "But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.",
  "8": "So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head.",
  "9": "Then all men will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.",
  "10": "The righteous man will be glad in the LORD and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory."
