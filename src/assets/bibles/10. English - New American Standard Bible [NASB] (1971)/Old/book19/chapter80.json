  "1": "Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth!",
  "2": "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your power And come to save us!",
  "3": "O God, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.",
  "4": "O LORD God of hosts, How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people?",
  "5": "You have fed them with the bread of tears, And You have made them to drink tears in large measure.",
  "6": "You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves.",
  "7": "O God of hosts, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.",
  "8": "You removed a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it.",
  "9": "You cleared the ground before it, And it took deep root and filled the land.",
  "10": "The mountains were covered with its shadow, And the cedars of God with its boughs.",
  "11": "It was sending out its branches to the sea And its shoots to the River.",
  "12": "Why have You broken down its hedges, So that all who pass that way pick its fruit?",
  "13": "A boar from the forest eats it away And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.",
  "14": "O God of hosts, turn again now, we beseech You; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,",
  "15": "Even the shoot which Your right hand has planted, And on the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself.",
  "16": "It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.",
  "17": "Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.",
  "18": "Then we shall not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.",
  "19": "O LORD God of hosts, restore us; Cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved."
