  "1": "Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my hands for war, And my fingers for battle;",
  "2": "My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.",
  "3": "O LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You think of him?",
  "4": "Man is like a mere breath; His days are like a passing shadow.",
  "5": "Bow Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.",
  "6": "Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Your arrows and confuse them.",
  "7": "Stretch forth Your hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens",
  "8": "Whose mouths speak deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "9": "I will sing a new song to You, O God; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,",
  "10": "Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.",
  "11": "Rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "12": "Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants, And our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace;",
  "13": "Let our garners be full, furnishing every kind of produce, And our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;",
  "14": "Let our cattle bear Without mishap and without loss, Let there be no outcry in our streets!",
  "15": "How blessed are the people who are so situated; How blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!"
