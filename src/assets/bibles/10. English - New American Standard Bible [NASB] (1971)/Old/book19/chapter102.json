  "1": "Hear my prayer, O LORD! And let my cry for help come to You.",

  "6": "I resemble a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl of the waste places.",
  "7": "I lie awake, I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop.",
  "8": "My enemies have reproached me all day long; Those who deride me have used my name as a curse.",
  "9": "For I have eaten ashes like bread And mingled my drink with weeping",
  "10": "Because of Your indignation and Your wrath, For You have lifted me up and cast me away.",
  "11": "My days are like a lengthened shadow, And I wither away like grass.",
  "12": "But You, O LORD, abide forever, And Your name to all generations.",

  "14": "Surely Your servants find pleasure in her stones And feel pity for her dust.",

  "20": "To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To set free those who were doomed to death,",
  "21": "That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion And His praise in Jerusalem,",

  "23": "He has weakened my strength in the way; He has shortened my days.",
  "24": "I say, \"O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days, Your years are throughout all generations.",
  "25": "\"Of old You founded the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.",
  "26": "\"Even they will perish, but You endure; And all of them will wear out like a garment; Like clothing You will change them and they will be changed.",
  "27": "\"But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an end.",
  "28": "\"The children of Your servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before You.\""
