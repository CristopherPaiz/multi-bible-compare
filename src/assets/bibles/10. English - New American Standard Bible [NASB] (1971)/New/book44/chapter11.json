  "14": "and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'",
  "15": "\"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning.",
  "16": "\"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'",
  "17": "\"Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?\"",
