  "1": "Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,",
  "2": "make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.",
  "3": "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;",
  "4": "do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.",
  "5": "Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,",
  "6": "who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,",
  "7": "but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.",
  "8": "Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.",
  "9": "For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,",
  "10": "so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,",
  "11": "and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",
  "12": "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;",
  "13": "for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.",
  "14": "Do all things without grumbling or disputing;",
  "15": "so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,",
  "16": "holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.",
  "17": "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.",
  "18": "You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.",
  "19": "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.",
  "20": "For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.",
  "21": "For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.",
  "22": "But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.",
  "23": "Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;",
  "24": "and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.",
  "25": "But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;",
  "26": "because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.",
  "27": "For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.",
  "28": "Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.",
  "29": "Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;",
  "30": "because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me."
