  "1": "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;",
  "2": "and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.",
  "3": "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;",
  "4": "and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.",
  "5": "For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.",
  "7": "Therefore do not be partakers with them;",
  "8": "for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light",
  "9": "(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),",
  "10": "trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;",
  "12": "for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.",
  "13": "But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.",
  "14": "For this reason it says, \"Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.\"",
  "15": "Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,",
  "16": "making the most of your time, because the days are evil.",
  "17": "So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.",
  "18": "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,",
  "19": "speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;",
  "20": "always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;",
  "21": "and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.",
  "23": "For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.",
  "24": "But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,",
  "26": "so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,",
  "27": "that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.",
  "28": "So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;",
  "29": "for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,",
  "30": "because we are members of His body.",
  "31": "FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.",
  "32": "This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.",
  "33": "Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
