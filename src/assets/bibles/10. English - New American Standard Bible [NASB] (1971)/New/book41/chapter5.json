  "11": "Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain.",
  "12": "The demons implored Him, saying, \"Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.\"",
  "13": "Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea.",

  "29": "Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.",
  "30": "Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, \"Who touched My garments?\"",
  "31": "And His disciples said to Him, \"You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'\"",
  "32": "And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.",
