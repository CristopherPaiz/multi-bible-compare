  "1": "He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.",
  "2": "And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching,",
  "3": "\"Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow;",
  "4": "as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.",
  "5": "\"Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.",
  "6": "\"And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.",
  "7": "\"Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.",
  "8": "\"Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.\"",
  "9": "And He was saying, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"",
  "10": "As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables.",
  "11": "And He was saying to them, \"To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables,",
  "12": "so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN.\"",
  "13": "And He said to them, \"Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?",
  "14": "\"The sower sows the word.",
  "15": "\"These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.",
  "16": "\"In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;",
  "17": "and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away.",
  "18": "\"And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,",
  "19": "but the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
  "20": "\"And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.\"",
  "21": "And He was saying to them, \"A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?",
  "22": "\"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light.",
  "23": "\"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\"",
  "24": "And He was saying to them, \"Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.",
  "25": "\"For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.\"",
  "26": "And He was saying, \"The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;",
  "27": "and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows--how, he himself does not know.",
  "28": "\"The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head.",
  "29": "\"But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.\"",
  "30": "And He said, \"How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?",
  "31": "\"It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil,",
  "32": "yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE.\"",
  "33": "With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it;",
  "34": "and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.",
  "35": "On that day, when evening came, He said to them, \"Let us go over to the other side.\"",
  "36": "Leaving the crowd, they took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him.",
  "37": "And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up.",
  "38": "Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke Him and said to Him, \"Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?\"",
  "39": "And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, \"Hush, be still.\" And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.",
  "40": "And He said to them, \"Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?\"",
  "41": "They became very much afraid and said to one another, \"Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?\""
