  "2": "and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed.",
  "3": "(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders;",
  "4": "and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)",
  "5": "The Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, \"Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?\"",
  "6": "And He said to them, \"Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.",
  "7": "'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'",
  "8": "\"Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.\"",
  "9": "He was also saying to them, \"You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.",
  "10": "\"For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH';",

  "19": "because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?\" (Thus He declared all foods clean.)",
  "20": "And He was saying, \"That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man.",
  "21": "\"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,",
