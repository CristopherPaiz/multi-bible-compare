  "20": "As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.",
  "21": "Being reminded, Peter said to Him, \"Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.\"",

  "31": "They began reasoning among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'",
