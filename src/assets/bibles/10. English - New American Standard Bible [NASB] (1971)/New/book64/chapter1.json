  "12": "Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.",
  "13": "I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;",
  "14": "but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face."
