  "1": "Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.",
  "2": "Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.",
  "3": "But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.",
  "4": "Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.",
  "5": "But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.",
  "6": "For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.",
  "7": "For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.",
  "8": "For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;",
  "9": "for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake.",
  "10": "Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.",
  "11": "However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.",
  "12": "For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.",
  "13": "Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?",
  "14": "Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,",
  "15": "but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.",
  "16": "But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.",
  "17": "But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.",
  "18": "For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.",
  "19": "For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.",
  "20": "Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper,",
  "21": "for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.",
  "22": "What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.",
  "23": "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;",
  "24": "and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, \"This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\"",
  "25": "In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\"",
  "26": "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.",
  "27": "Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.",
  "29": "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.",
  "30": "For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.",
  "31": "But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.",
  "32": "But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.",
  "33": "So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.",
  "34": "If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come."
