  "1": "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.",
  "2": "If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.",
  "4": "Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,",
  "5": "does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,",
  "6": "does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;",
  "7": "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.",
  "9": "For we know in part and we prophesy in part;",

  "11": "When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.",
  "12": "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.",
  "13": "But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love."
