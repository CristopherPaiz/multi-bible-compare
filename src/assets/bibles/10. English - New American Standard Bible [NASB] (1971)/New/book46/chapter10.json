  "3": "and all ate the same spiritual food;",
  "4": "and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.",

  "6": "Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved.",
  "7": "Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, \"THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY.\"",
  "8": "Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.",
  "9": "Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents.",
  "10": "Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.",

  "13": "No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.",
  "14": "Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",

  "17": "Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.",
  "18": "Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?",
  "19": "What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
  "20": "No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons.",
