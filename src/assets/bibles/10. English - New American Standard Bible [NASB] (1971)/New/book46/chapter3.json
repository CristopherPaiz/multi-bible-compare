  "1": "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.",
  "2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,",
  "3": "for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?",
  "4": "For when one says, \"I am of Paul,\" and another, \"I am of Apollos,\" are you not mere men?",
  "5": "What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.",
  "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.",
  "7": "So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.",
  "8": "Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
  "9": "For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.",
  "10": "According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.",
  "11": "For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,",
  "13": "each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.",
  "14": "If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.",
  "15": "If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.",
  "16": "Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
  "17": "If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.",
  "18": "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise.",
  "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, \"He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS\";",
  "20": "and again, \"THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.\"",
  "21": "So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,",
  "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,",
  "23": "and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God."
