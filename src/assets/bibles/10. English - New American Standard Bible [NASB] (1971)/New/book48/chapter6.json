  "3": "For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.",

  "15": "For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.",
  "16": "And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.",
  "17": "From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.",
  "18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."
