  "1": "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.",
  "2": "For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.",
  "3": "Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.",
  "4": "Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.",
  "5": "So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!",
  "6": "And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.",
  "7": "For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.",

  "9": "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;",
  "10": "from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.",
  "11": "Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?",

  "13": "Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.",
  "14": "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.",
  "15": "This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.",
  "16": "For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.",
  "17": "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.",
  "18": "And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
