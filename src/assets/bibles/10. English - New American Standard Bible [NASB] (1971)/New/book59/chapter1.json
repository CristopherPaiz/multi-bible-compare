  "1": "James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.",
  "2": "Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,",
  "3": "knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.",
  "4": "And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.",
  "5": "But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.",
  "6": "But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.",
  "7": "For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,",
  "8": "being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.",
  "9": "But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;",
  "10": "and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.",
  "11": "For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.",
  "12": "Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.",
  "13": "Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am being tempted by God\"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.",
  "14": "But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.",
  "15": "Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.",
  "16": "Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.",
  "17": "Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.",
  "18": "In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.",
  "19": "This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;",
  "20": "for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.",
  "21": "Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.",
  "22": "But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.",
  "23": "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;",
  "24": "for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.",
  "25": "But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.",
  "26": "If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.",
  "27": "Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
