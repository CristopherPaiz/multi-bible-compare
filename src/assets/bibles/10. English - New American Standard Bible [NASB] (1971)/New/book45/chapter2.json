  "1": "Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.",
  "2": "And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.",
  "3": "But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?",
  "4": "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?",
  "5": "But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,",
  "6": "who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS:",
  "7": "to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;",
  "8": "but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.",
  "9": "There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,",
  "10": "but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.",
  "11": "For there is no partiality with God.",
  "12": "For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;",
  "13": "for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.",
  "14": "For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,",
  "15": "in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,",
  "16": "on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.",
  "17": "But if you bear the name \"Jew\" and rely upon the Law and boast in God,",
  "18": "and know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,",
  "19": "and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,",
  "20": "a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,",
  "21": "you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?",
  "22": "You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
  "23": "You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?",
  "24": "For \"THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU,\" just as it is written.",
  "25": "For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
  "26": "So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?",
  "27": "And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?",
  "28": "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.",
  "29": "But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God."
