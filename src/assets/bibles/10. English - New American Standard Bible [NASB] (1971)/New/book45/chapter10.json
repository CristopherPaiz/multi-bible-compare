  "1": "Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.",
  "2": "For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.",
  "3": "For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.",
  "4": "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.",
  "5": "For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.",
  "6": "But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: \"DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, 'WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?' (that is, to bring Christ down),",
  "7": "or 'WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\"",
  "8": "But what does it say? \"THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART\"--that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,",
  "9": "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;",
  "10": "for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.",
  "11": "For the Scripture says, \"WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\"",
  "12": "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;",
  "13": "for \"WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.\"",
  "14": "How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?",
  "15": "How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, \"HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!\"",
  "16": "However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, \"LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?\"",
  "17": "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.",
  "18": "But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; \"THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.\"",
  "19": "But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, \"I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.\"",
  "20": "And Isaiah is very bold and says, \"I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.\"",
  "21": "But as for Israel He says, \"ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.\""
