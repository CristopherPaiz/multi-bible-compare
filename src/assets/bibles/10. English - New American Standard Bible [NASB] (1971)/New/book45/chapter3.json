  "4": "May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, \"THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED.\"",
  "5": "But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? ( I am speaking in human terms.)",

  "7": "But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?",
  "8": "And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), \"Let us do evil that good may come\"? Their condemnation is just.",
