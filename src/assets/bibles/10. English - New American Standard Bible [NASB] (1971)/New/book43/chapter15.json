  "3": "\"You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.",
  "4": "\"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.",
  "5": "\"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.",
  "6": "\"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned.",

  "16": "\"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.",

  "21": "\"But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.",
  "22": "\"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "\"He who hates Me hates My Father also.",
  "24": "\"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.",
  "25": "\"But they have done this to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.'",
