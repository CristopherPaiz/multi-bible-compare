  "1": "Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him.",
  "2": "And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him;",
  "3": "and they began to come up to Him and say, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" and to give Him slaps in the face.",
  "4": "Pilate came out again and said to them, \"Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him.\"",
  "5": "Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \"Behold, the Man!\"",
  "6": "So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, \"Crucify, crucify!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him.\"",
  "7": "The Jews answered him, \"We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God.\"",
  "8": "Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid;",
  "9": "and he entered into the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, \"Where are You from?\" But Jesus gave him no answer.",
  "10": "So Pilate said to Him, \"You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?\"",
  "11": "Jesus answered, \"You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.\"",
  "12": "As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, \"If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar.\"",
  "13": "Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.",
  "14": "Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, \"Behold, your King!\"",
  "15": "So they cried out, \"Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"",
  "16": "So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.",
  "17": "They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.",
  "18": "There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.",
  "19": "Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, \"JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\"",
  "20": "Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin and in Greek.",
  "21": "So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, \"Do not write, 'The King of the Jews'; but that He said, 'I am King of the Jews.'\"",
  "22": "Pilate answered, \"What I have written I have written.\"",
  "23": "Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.",
  "24": "So they said to one another, \"Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be\"; this was to fulfill the Scripture: \"THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS.\"",
  "25": "Therefore the soldiers did these things. But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.",
  "26": "When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, \"Woman, behold, your son!\"",
  "27": "Then He said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother!\" From that hour the disciple took her into his own household.",
  "28": "After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, \"I am thirsty.\"",
  "29": "A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.",
  "30": "Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, \"It is finished!\" And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.",
  "31": "Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.",
  "32": "So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him;",
  "33": "but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.",
  "34": "But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.",
  "35": "And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.",
  "36": "For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, \"NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.\"",
  "37": "And again another Scripture says, \"THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED.\"",
  "38": "After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.",
  "39": "Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.",
  "40": "So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.",
  "41": "Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.",
  "42": "Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."
