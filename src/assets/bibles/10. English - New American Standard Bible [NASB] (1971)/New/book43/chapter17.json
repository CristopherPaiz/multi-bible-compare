  "14": "\"I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.",
  "15": "\"I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.",
  "16": "\"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.",

  "21": "that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.",
  "22": "\"The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;",
  "23": "I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me.",
  "24": "\"Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.",
  "25": "\"O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me;",
  "26": "and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\""
