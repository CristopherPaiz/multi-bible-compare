  "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,",
  "2": "and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:",
  "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "4": "I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,",
  "5": "because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;",
  "6": "and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake.",
  "7": "For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
  "8": "Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,",
  "9": "yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you--since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--",
  "10": "I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,",
  "11": "who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.",
  "12": "I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,",
  "13": "whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;",
  "14": "but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.",
  "15": "For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,",
  "16": "no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
  "17": "If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me.",
  "18": "But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;",
  "19": "I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).",
  "20": "Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
  "21": "Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.",
  "22": "At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.",
  "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
  "24": "as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.",
  "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
