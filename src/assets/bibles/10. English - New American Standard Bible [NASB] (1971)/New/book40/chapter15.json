  "1": "Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,",
  "2": "\"Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.\"",
  "3": "And He answered and said to them, \"Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?",
  "4": "\"For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.'",
  "5": "\"But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, \"Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,\"",
  "6": "he is not to honor his father or his mother.' And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.",
  "7": "\"You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:",
  "8": "'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.",
  "9": "'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'\"",
  "10": "After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, \"Hear and understand.",
  "11": "\"It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.\"",
  "12": "Then the disciples came and said to Him, \"Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?\"",
  "13": "But He answered and said, \"Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted.",
  "14": "\"Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\"",
  "15": "Peter said to Him, \"Explain the parable to us.\"",
  "16": "Jesus said, \"Are you still lacking in understanding also?",
  "17": "\"Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?",
  "18": "\"But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.",
  "19": "\"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.",
  "20": "\"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.\"",
  "21": "Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.",
  "22": "And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, \"Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.\"",
  "23": "But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, \"Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.\"",
  "24": "But He answered and said, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"",
  "25": "But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, \"Lord, help me!\"",
  "26": "And He answered and said, \"It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\"",
  "27": "But she said, \"Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\"",
  "28": "Then Jesus said to her, \"O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish.\" And her daughter was healed at once.",
  "29": "Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there.",
  "30": "And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them.",
  "31": "So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.",
  "32": "And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, \"I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.\"",
  "33": "The disciples said to Him, \"Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?\"",
  "34": "And Jesus said to them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" And they said, \"Seven, and a few small fish.\"",
  "35": "And He directed the people to sit down on the ground;",
  "36": "and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.",
  "37": "And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full.",
  "38": "And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.",
  "39": "And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan."
