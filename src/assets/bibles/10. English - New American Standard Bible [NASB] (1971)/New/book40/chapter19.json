  "5": "and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?",
  "6": "\"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\"",
  "7": "They said to Him, \"Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?\"",
  "8": "He said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.",
  "9": "\"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.\"",
  "10": "The disciples said to Him, \"If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.\"",
  "11": "But He said to them, \"Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.",
  "12": "\"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.\"",
  "13": "Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.",

  "15": "After laying His hands on them, He departed from there.",
  "16": "And someone came to Him and said, \"Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?\"",
  "17": "And He said to him, \"Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.\"",
  "18": "Then he said to Him, \"Which ones?\" And Jesus said, \"YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS;",

  "20": "The young man said to Him, \"All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?\"",
  "21": "Jesus said to him, \"If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.\"",
  "22": "But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.",
  "23": "And Jesus said to His disciples, \"Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.",
