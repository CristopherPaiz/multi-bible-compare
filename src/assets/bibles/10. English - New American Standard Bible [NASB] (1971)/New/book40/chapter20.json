  "7": "\"They said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'",
  "8": "\"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.'",
  "9": "\"When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.",

  "18": "\"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,",
  "19": "and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised up.\"",
  "20": "Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him.",
  "21": "And He said to her, \"What do you wish?\" She said to Him, \"Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.\"",
