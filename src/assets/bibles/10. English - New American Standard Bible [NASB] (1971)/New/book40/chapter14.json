  "11": "And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.",
  "12": "His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.",
  "13": "Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities.",
  "14": "When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.",

  "20": "and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.",

  "22": "Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.",
  "23": "After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone.",
