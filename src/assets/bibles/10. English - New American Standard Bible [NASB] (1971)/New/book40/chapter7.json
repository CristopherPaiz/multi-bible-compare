  "4": "\"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and behold, the log is in your own eye?",
  "5": "\"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.",
  "6": "\"Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.",

  "15": "\"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.",
  "16": "\"You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?",
  "17": "\"So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.",
  "18": "\"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.",
  "19": "\"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.",
