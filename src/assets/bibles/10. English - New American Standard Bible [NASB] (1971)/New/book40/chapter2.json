  "10": "When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.",
  "11": "After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",

  "15": "He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: \"OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON.\"",

  "19": "But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,",
  "20": "\"Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life are dead.\"",
  "21": "So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.",
  "22": "But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee,",
