  "1": "Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.",
  "2": "Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, \"This man receives sinners and eats with them.\"",
  "3": "So He told them this parable, saying,",
  "4": "\"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?",
  "5": "\"When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.",
  "6": "\"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'",
  "7": "\"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.",
  "8": "\"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?",
  "9": "\"When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!'",
  "10": "\"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"",
  "11": "And He said, \"A man had two sons.",
  "12": "\"The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them.",
  "13": "\"And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.",
  "14": "\"Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished.",
  "15": "\"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.",
  "16": "\"And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.",
  "17": "\"But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!",
  "18": "'I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;",
  "19": "I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.\"'",
  "20": "\"So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.",
  "21": "\"And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'",
  "22": "\"But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;",
  "23": "and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;",
  "24": "for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate.",
  "25": "\"Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
  "26": "\"And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.",
  "27": "\"And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.'",
  "28": "\"But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.",
  "29": "\"But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;",
  "30": "but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'",
  "31": "\"And he said to him, 'Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours.",
  "32": "'But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.'\""
