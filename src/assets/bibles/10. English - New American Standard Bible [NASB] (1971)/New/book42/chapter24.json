  "23": "and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.",
  "24": "\"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.\"",
  "25": "And He said to them, \"O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "26": "\"Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?\"",

  "33": "And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,",
  "34": "saying, \"The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.\"",
  "35": "They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.",
  "36": "While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, \"Peace be to you.\"",
  "37": "But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit.",
  "38": "And He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
  "39": "\"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\"",
