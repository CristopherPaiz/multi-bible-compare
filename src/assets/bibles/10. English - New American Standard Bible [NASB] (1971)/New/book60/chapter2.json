  "4": "And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,",
  "5": "you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.",
  "6": "For this is contained in Scripture: \"BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\"",

  "12": "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.",

  "19": "For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.",
  "20": "For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.",
  "21": "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,",
