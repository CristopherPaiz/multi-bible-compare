  "2": "I love you because of the truth that is alive in us. That truth will be with us forever.",
  "3": "God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son will give you grace, mercy and peace. Those blessings will be with us because we love the truth.",
  "4": "It has given me great joy to find some of your children living by the truth. That's just what the Father commanded us to do.",
  "5": "Dear lady, I'm not writing you a new command. I'm writing a command we've had from the beginning. I'm asking that we love one another.",
  "6": "The way we show our love is to obey God's commands. He commands you to lead a life of love. That's what you have heard from the beginning.",
  "7": "Many people who try to fool others have gone out into the world. They don't agree that Jesus Christ came in a human body. People like that try to trick others. They are enemies of Christ.",
  "8": "Watch out that you don't lose what you have worked for. Make sure that you get your complete reward.",
  "9": "Some people run ahead of others. They don't follow the teaching of Christ. People like that don't belong to God. But those who follow the teaching of Christ belong to the Father and the Son.",
  "10": "Suppose someone comes to you and doesn't teach these truths. Then don't take him into your house. Don't welcome him.",
  "11": "Anyone who welcomes him shares in his evil work.",
  "12": "I have a lot to write to you. But I don't want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope I can visit you. Then I can talk with you face to face. That will make our joy complete.",
  "13": "The children of your chosen sister send their greetings."
