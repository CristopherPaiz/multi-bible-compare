  "9": "'I know that you suffer and are poor. But you are rich! Some people say they are Jews but are not. I know that their words are evil. Their worship is satanic.",
  "10": "'Don't be afraid of what you are going to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you. You will be treated badly for ten days. Be faithful, even if it means you must die. Then I will give you a crown. The crown is life itself.",

  "14": "'But I have a few things against you. You have people there who follow the teaching of Balaam. He taught Balak to lead the people of Israel into sin. So they ate food that had been offered to statues of gods. And they committed sexual sins.",
  "15": "You also have people who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans.",
  "16": "'So turn away from your sins! If you don't, I will come to you soon. I will fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth.",

  "21": "'I've given her time to turn away from her sinful ways. But she doesn't want to.",
  "22": "She sinned on a bed. So I will make her suffer on a bed. And those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly. Their only way out is to turn away from what she taught them to do.",
