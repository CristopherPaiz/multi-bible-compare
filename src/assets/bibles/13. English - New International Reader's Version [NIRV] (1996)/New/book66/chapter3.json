  "4": "'But you have a few people in Sardis who have kept their clothes clean. They will walk with me, dressed in white, because they are worthy.",
  "5": "Those who overcome will also be dressed in white. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life. I will speak of them by name to my Father and his angels.",

  "11": "'I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have. Then no one will take away your crown.",
  "12": "'I'll see to it that those who overcome will be pillars in the temple of my God. They will never leave it again. I will write the name of my God on them. I will write the name of the city of my God on them. This is the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God. I will also write my new name on them.",
