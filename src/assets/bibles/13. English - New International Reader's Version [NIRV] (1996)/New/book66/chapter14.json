  "1": "I looked, and there in front of me was the Lamb. He was standing on Mount Zion. With him were 144,000 people. Written on their foreheads were his name and his Father's name.",
  "2": "I heard a sound from heaven. It was like the roar of rushing waters and loud thunder. The sound I heard was like the music of harps being played.",
  "3": "Then everyone sang a new song in front of the throne. They sang it in front of the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000. They had been set free from the evil of the earth.",
  "4": "They had not committed sexual sins with women. They had kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among people as a first offering to God and the Lamb.",
  "5": "Their mouths told no lies. They are without blame.",
  "6": "I saw another angel. He was flying high in the air. He came to tell everyone on earth the good news that will always be true. He told it to every nation, tribe, language and people.",
  "7": "In a loud voice he said, \"Have respect for God. Give him glory. The hour has come for God to judge. Worship him who made the heavens and the earth. Worship him who made the sea and the springs of water.\"",
  "8": "A second angel followed him. He said, \"Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! The city of Babylon made all the nations drink the strong wine of her terrible sins.\"",
  "9": "A third angel followed them. He said in a loud voice, \"Watch out, all you who worship the beast and his statue! Watch out, all you who have his mark on your forehead or your hand!",
  "10": "You, too, will drink the wine of God's great anger. His wine has been poured full strength into the cup of his anger. You will be burned with flaming sulfur. The holy angels and the Lamb will see it happen.",
  "11": "The smoke of your terrible suffering will rise for ever and ever. Day and night, there is no rest for you who worship the beast and his statue. There is no rest for you who receive the mark of his name.\"",
  "12": "God's people need to be very patient. They are the ones who obey God's commands. They remain faithful to Jesus.",
  "13": "Then I heard a voice from heaven. \"Write this,\" it said. \"Blessed are the dead who die as believers in the Lord from now on.\" \"Yes,\" says the Holy Spirit. \"They will rest from their labor. What they have done will not be forgotten.\"",
  "14": "I looked, and there in front of me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was One who looked \"like a son of man.\"--(Daniel 7:13) He wore a gold crown on his head. In his hand was a sharp, curved blade for cutting grain.",
  "15": "Then another angel came out of the temple. He called in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud. \"Take your blade,\" he said. \"Cut the grain. The time has come. The earth is ready to be harvested.\"",
  "16": "So the one sitting on the cloud swung his blade over the earth. And the earth was harvested.",
  "17": "Another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He too had a sharp, curved blade.",
  "18": "Still another angel came from the altar. He was in charge of the fire on the altar. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp blade. \"Take your blade,\" he said, \"and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth's vine. Its grapes are ripe.\"",
  "19": "So the angel swung his blade over the earth. He gathered its grapes. Then he threw them into a huge winepress. The winepress stands for God's anger.",
  "20": "In the winepress outside the city, the grapes were stomped on. Blood flowed out of the pit. It spread over the land for about 180 miles. It rose as high as the horses' heads."
