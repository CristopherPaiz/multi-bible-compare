  "1": "Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. The scroll had writing on both sides. It was sealed with seven seals.",
  "2": "I saw a mighty angel calling out in a loud voice, \"Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?\"",
  "3": "But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll. No one could even look inside it.",
  "4": "I cried and cried because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.",
  "5": "Then one of the elders said to me, \"Do not cry! The Lion of the tribe of Judah has won the battle. He is the Root of David. He is able to break the seven seals and open the scroll.\"",
  "6": "Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if he had been put to death. He stood in the center of the area around the throne. The Lamb was surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes. The eyes stand for the seven spirits of God, which are sent out into all the earth.",
  "7": "The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne.",
  "8": "Then the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one had a harp. They were holding golden bowls full of incense, which stand for the prayers of God's people.",
  "9": "Here is the new song they sang. \"You are worthy to take the scroll and break open its seals. You are worthy because you were put to death. With your blood you bought people for God. They come from every tribe, language, people and nation.",
  "10": "You have made them members of a royal family. You have made them priests to serve our God. They will rule on the earth.\"",
  "11": "Then I looked and heard the voice of millions and millions of angels. They surrounded the throne. They surrounded the living creatures and the elders.",
  "12": "In a loud voice they sang, \"The Lamb, who was put to death, is worthy! He is worthy to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength! He is worthy to receive honor and glory and praise!\"",
  "13": "All creatures in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them, were singing. I heard them say, \"May praise and honor for ever and ever be given to the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb! Give them glory and power 'XY'for ever and ever!\"",
  "14": "The four living creatures said, \"Amen.\" And the elders fell down and worshiped."
