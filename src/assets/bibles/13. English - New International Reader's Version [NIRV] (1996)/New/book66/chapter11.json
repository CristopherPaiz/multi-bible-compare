  "3": "\"I will give power to my two witnesses. They will prophesy for 1,260 days. They will be dressed in black clothes to show how sad they are.\"",
  "4": "The witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in front of the Lord of the earth.",
  "5": "If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and eats up their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.",
  "6": "These witnesses have power to close up the sky. Then it will not rain while they are prophesying. They also have power to turn the waters into blood. And they can strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want to.",
  "7": "When they have finished giving their witness, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them. He will overpower them and kill them.",

  "17": "They said, \"Lord God who rules over all, we give thanks to you. You are the One who is and who was. We give you thanks because you have taken your great power and have begun to rule.",
  "18": "The nations were angry, and the time for your anger has come. The time has come to judge the dead. It is time to reward your servants the prophets and your own people and those who honor you. There is a reward for all your people, both great and small. It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth.\"",
