  "4": "The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of God's people rose up from the angel's hand. It went up in front of God.",
  "5": "Then the angel took the cup and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it down on the earth. There were rumblings and thunder, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.",
  "6": "Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.",

  "13": "As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air. It called out in a loud voice, \"How terrible! How terrible it will be for those living on the earth! How terrible! They will suffer as soon as the next three angels blow their trumpets!\""
