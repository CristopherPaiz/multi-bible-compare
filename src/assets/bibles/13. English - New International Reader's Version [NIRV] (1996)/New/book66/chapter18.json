  "1": "After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority. His glory filled the earth with light.",
  "2": "With a mighty voice he shouted, \"Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has become a place where demons live. She has become a den for every evil spirit. She has become a nest for every 'unclean' and hated bird.",
  "3": "All the nations have drunk the strong wine of her terrible sins. The kings of the earth took part in her evil ways. The traders of the world grew rich from her great wealth.\"",
  "4": "Then I heard another voice from heaven. It said, \"Come out of her, my people. Then you will not take part in her sins. You will not suffer from any of her plagues.",
  "5": "Her sins are piled up to heaven. God has remembered her crimes.",
  "6": "Do to her as she has done to others. Pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double dose of what she has mixed for others.",
  "7": "Give her as much pain and suffering as the glory and wealth she gave herself. She brags to herself, 'I rule like a queen. I am not a widow. I will never be sad.'",
  "8": "But she will be plagued by death, sadness and hunger. In a single day they will all catch up with her. She will be burned up by fire. The Lord God who judges her is mighty.",
  "9": "\"The kings of the earth who committed terrible sins with her will sob. They will be sad because they used to share her riches. They will see the smoke rising as she burns.",
  "10": "They will be terrified by her suffering. Standing far away, they will exclaim, \" 'How terrible! How terrible it is for you, great city! How terrible for you, Babylon, city of power! In just one hour you have been destroyed!'",
  "11": "\"The traders of the world will cry and be sad over her. No one buys what they sell anymore.",
  "12": "Here is what they had for sale. Gold, silver, jewels, pearls. Fine linen, purple, silk, bright red cloth. Every kind of expensive wood. All sorts of articles made out of ivory, valuable wood, bronze, iron and marble.",
  "13": "Cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense. Wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat. Cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, human slaves.",
  "14": "\"The merchants will say, 'The pleasure you longed for has left you. All your riches and glory have disappeared forever.'",
  "15": "The traders who sold these things and became rich because of her will stand far away. Her suffering will terrify them. They will cry and be sad.",
  "16": "They will cry out, \" 'How terrible! How terrible it is for you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and bright red! How terrible for you, great city, gleaming with gold, jewels and pearls!",
  "17": "In just one hour your great wealth has been destroyed!' \"Every sea captain and all who travel by ship will stand far away. So will the sailors and all who earn their living from the sea.",
  "18": "They will see the smoke rising as Babylon burns. They will ask, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?'",
  "19": "They will throw dust on their heads. They will cry and be sad. They will cry out, \" 'How terrible! How terrible it is for you, great city! All who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth! In just one hour she has been destroyed!",
  "20": "Heaven, be glad for this! God's people, be glad! Apostles and prophets, be glad! God has judged her for the way she treated you.' \"",
  "21": "Then a mighty angel picked up a huge rock. It was the size of a large millstone. He threw it into the sea. Then he said, \"That is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down. Never again will it be found.",
  "22": "The songs of musicians will never be heard in you again. Gone will be the music of harp, flute and trumpet. No worker of any kind will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.",
  "23": "The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voices of brides and grooms will never be heard in you again. Your traders were among the world's most important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led down the wrong path.",
  "24": "You were guilty of the murder of prophets and God's people. You were guilty of the blood of all who have been killed on the earth.\""
