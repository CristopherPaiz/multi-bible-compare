  "3": "We came near Cyprus and passed to the south of it. Then we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre. There our ship was supposed to unload.",
  "4": "We found the believers there and stayed with them for seven days. Led by the Holy Spirit, they tried to get Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.",
  "5": "But when it was time to leave, we continued on our way. All the believers and their families went with us out of the city. There on the beach we got down on our knees to pray.",
  "6": "We said good-by to each other. Then we went on board the ship. And they returned home.",
  "7": "Continuing on from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brothers and sisters. We stayed with them for a day.",

  "20": "When they heard this, they praised God. Then they spoke to Paul. \"Brother,\" they said, \"you see that thousands of Jews have become believers. All of them try very hard to obey the law.",
  "21": "They have been told that you teach all the Jews who live among the non-Jews to turn away from Moses. They think that you teach them not to circumcise their children. They think that you teach them to give up our Jewish ways.",
  "22": "\"What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.",
  "23": "So do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a promise to God.",
  "24": "Take them with you. Join them in the Jewish practice that makes people pure and clean. Pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know that these reports about you are not true in any way. They will know that you yourself obey the law.",
  "25": "\"We have already given written directions to the believers who are not Jews. They must not eat food that has been offered to statues of gods. They must not drink blood. They must not eat the meat of animals that have been choked to death. And they must not commit sexual sins.\"",
  "26": "The next day Paul took the men with him. They all made themselves pure and clean in the usual way. Then Paul went to the temple. There he reported the date when the days of cleansing would end. At that time the proper offering would be made for each of them.",
  "27": "The seven days of cleansing were almost over. Some Jews from Asia Minor saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd. They arrested Paul.",
  "28": "\"Men of Israel, help us!\" they shouted. \"This is the man who teaches everyone in all places against our people. He speaks against our law and against this holy place. Besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area. He has made this holy place unclean.\"",
  "29": "They said this because they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul. They thought Paul had brought him into the temple area.",

  "31": "The people were trying to kill Paul. But news reached the commander of the Roman troops. He heard that people were making trouble in the whole city of Jerusalem.",

  "36": "The crowd that followed kept shouting, \"Kill him!\"",
  "37": "The soldiers were about to take Paul into the fort. Then he asked the commander, \"May I say something to you?\" \"Do you speak Greek?\" he replied.",

  "39": "Paul answered, \"I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia. I am a citizen of an important city. Please let me speak to the people.\"",
