  "1": "What should we say then? Should we keep on sinning so that God's grace can increase?",
  "2": "Not at all! As far as sin is concerned, we are dead. So how can we keep on sinning?",
  "3": "All of us were baptized into Christ Jesus. Don't you know that we were baptized into his death?",
  "4": "By being baptized, we were buried with Christ into his death. Christ has been raised from the dead by the Father's glory. And like Christ we also can live a new life.",
  "5": "By being baptized, we have been joined with him in his death. We will certainly also be joined with him in his resurrection.",
  "6": "We know that what we used to be was nailed to the cross with him. That happened so our sinful bodies would lose their power. We are no longer slaves of sin.",
  "7": "Those who have died have been set free from sin.",
  "8": "We died with Christ. So we believe that we will also live with him.",
  "9": "We know that Christ was raised from the dead and will never die again. Death doesn't control him anymore.",
  "10": "When he died, he died once and for all time as far as sin is concerned. Now that he lives, he lives as far as God is concerned.",
  "11": "In the same way, consider yourselves to be dead as far as sin is concerned. Now that you believe in Christ Jesus, consider yourselves to be alive as far as God is concerned.",
  "12": "So don't let sin rule your body, which is going to die. Don't obey its evil longings.",
  "13": "Don't give the parts of your body to serve sin. Don't let them be used to do evil. Instead, give yourselves to God. You have been brought from death to life. Give the parts of your body to him to do what is right.",
  "14": "Sin will not be your master. Law does not rule you. God's grace has set you free.",
  "15": "What should we say then? Should we sin because we are not ruled by law but by God's grace? Not at all!",
  "16": "Don't you know that when you give yourselves to obey someone you become that person's slave? You can be slaves of sin. Then you will die. Or you can be slaves who obey God. Then you will live a godly life.",
  "17": "You used to be slaves of sin. But thank God that with your whole heart you obeyed the teachings you were given!",
  "18": "You have been set free from sin. You have become slaves to right living.",
  "19": "Because you are human, you find this hard to understand. So I have said it in a way that will help you understand it. You used to give the parts of your body to be slaves to unclean living. You were becoming more and more evil. Now give your bodies to be slaves to right living. Then you will become holy.",
  "20": "Once you were slaves of sin. At that time right living did not control you.",
  "21": "What benefit did you gain from doing the things you are now ashamed of? Those things lead to death!",
  "22": "You have been set free from sin. God has made you his slaves. The benefit you gain leads to holy living. And the end result is eternal life.",
  "23": "When you sin, the pay you get is death. But God gives you the gift of eternal life because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done."
