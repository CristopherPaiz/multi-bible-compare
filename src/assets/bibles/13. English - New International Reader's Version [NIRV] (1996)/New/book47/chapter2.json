  "1": "So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.",
  "2": "If I make you sad, who is going to make me glad? Only you, the one I made sad.",
  "3": "I wrote what I did for a special reason. When I came, I didn't want to be troubled by those who should make me glad. I was sure that all of you would share my joy.",
  "4": "I was very troubled when I wrote to you. My heart was sad. My eyes were full of tears. I didn't want to make you sad. I wanted to let you know that I love you very deeply.",
  "5": "Suppose someone has made us sad. In some ways, he hasn't made me sad so much as he has made all of you sad. But I don't want to put this too strongly.",

  "14": "Give thanks to God! He always leads us in the winners' parade because we belong to Christ. Through us, God spreads the knowledge of Christ everywhere like perfume.",
  "15": "God considers us to be the sweet smell that Christ is spreading among people who are being saved and people who are dying.",
  "16": "To the one, we are the smell of death. To the other, we are the perfume of life. Who is able to do that work?",
  "17": "Unlike many people, we aren't selling God's word to make money. In fact, it is just the opposite. Because of Christ we speak honestly before God. We speak like people God has sent."
