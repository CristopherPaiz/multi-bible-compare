  "5": "Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.",
  "6": "\"I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.",
  "7": "Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.'--(Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.",
  "8": "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.\"",

  "10": "A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, \"Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?\"",
  "11": "He said to them, \"What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?",
  "12": "A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.\"",
  "13": "Then Jesus said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.",

  "25": "Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, \"Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.",
  "26": "If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?",
  "27": "You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.",
  "28": "But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.",
  "29": "\"Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.",
  "30": "\"Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.",

  "32": "Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.",

  "34": "\"You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.",
  "35": "A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.",

  "37": "By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty.\"",
  "38": "Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, \"Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.\"",
  "39": "He answered, \"Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.",

  "41": "\"The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now one who is more important than Jonah is here.",
  "42": "\"The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom. And now one who is more important than Solomon is here.",
