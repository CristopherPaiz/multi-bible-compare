  "1": "At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, \"Who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven?\"",
  "2": "Jesus called a little child over to him. He had the child stand among them.",
  "3": "Jesus said, \"What I'm about to tell you is true. You need to change and become like little children. If you don't, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.",
  "4": "Anyone who becomes as free of pride as this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven.",
  "5": "\"Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.",
  "6": "\"But what if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.",
  "7": "\"How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Things like that must come. But how terrible for those who cause them!",
  "8": "\"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand or one foot than to go into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell the fire burns forever.",
  "9": "If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.",
  "10": "\"See that you don't look down on one of these little ones. Here is what I tell you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my Father who is in heaven.",
  "11": "",
  "12": "\"What do you think? Suppose a man owns 100 sheep and one of them wanders away. Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the hills? Won't he go and look for the one that wandered off?",
  "13": "What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he is happier about the one than about the 99 that didn't wander off.",
  "14": "It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost.",
  "15": "\"If your brother sins against you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.",
  "16": "\"But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. Scripture says, 'Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses.'--(Deuteronomy 19:15)",
  "17": "But what if he also refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then don't treat him as your brother. Treat him as you would treat an ungodly person or a tax collector.",
  "18": "\"What I'm about to tell you is true. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.",
  "19": "\"Again, here is what I tell you. Suppose two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you.",
  "20": "Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them.\"",
  "21": "Peter came to Jesus. He asked, \"Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?\"",
  "22": "Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times.",
  "23": "\"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him.",
  "24": "As the king began to do it, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.",
  "25": "The man was not able to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all he owned had to be sold to pay back what he owed.",
  "26": "\"The servant fell on his knees in front of him. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I'll pay everything back.'",
  "27": "\"His master felt sorry for him. He forgave him what he owed and let him go.",
  "28": "\"But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he said.",
  "29": "\"The other servant fell on his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged him. 'I'll pay you back.'",
  "30": "\"But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison. The man would be held there until he could pay back what he owed.",
  "31": "The other servants saw what had happened. It troubled them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had happened.",
  "32": "\"Then the master called the first servant in. 'You evil servant,' he said. 'I forgave all that you owed me because you begged me to.",
  "33": "Shouldn't you have had mercy on the other servant just as I had mercy on you?'",
  "34": "In anger his master turned him over to the jailers. He would be punished until he paid back everything he owed.",
  "35": "\"This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.\""
