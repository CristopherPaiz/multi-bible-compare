  "1": "Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders. I want to stir you up to think in a way that is pure.",
  "2": "I want you to remember the words the holy prophets spoke in the past. Remember the command our Lord and Savior gave through your apostles.",
  "3": "First of all, here is what you must understand. In the last days people will make fun of the truth. They will laugh at it. They will follow their own evil longings.",
  "4": "They will say, \"Where is this 'return' he promised? Everything goes on in the same way it has since our people of long ago died. In fact, it has continued that way since God first created everything.\"",
  "5": "Long ago, God's word brought the heavens into being. His word separated the earth from the waters. And the waters surrounded it. But those people forget things like that on purpose.",
  "6": "The waters also flooded the world of that time. It was destroyed.",
  "7": "By God's word the heavens and earth of today are being reserved for fire. They are being kept for the day when God will judge. Then ungodly people will be destroyed.",
  "8": "Dear friends, here is one thing you must not forget. With the Lord a day is like a thousand years. And a thousand years are like a day.",
  "9": "The Lord is not slow to keep his promise. He is not slow in the way some people understand it. He is patient with you. He doesn't want anyone to be destroyed. Instead, he wants all people to turn away from their sins.",
  "10": "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar. Fire will destroy everything in them. God will judge the earth and everything in it.",
  "11": "So everything will be destroyed. And what kind of people should you be? You should lead holy and godly lives.",
  "12": "Live like that as you look forward to the day of God. It will make the day come more quickly. On that day fire will destroy the heavens. Its heat will melt everything in them.",
  "13": "But we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth. Godliness will make its home there. All of this is in keeping with God's promise.",
  "14": "Dear friends, I know you are looking forward to that. So try your best to be found pure and without blame. Be at peace with God.",
  "15": "Remember that while our Lord is waiting patiently to return, people are being saved. Our dear brother Paul also wrote to you about that. God made him wise to write as he did.",
  "16": "He writes the same way in all his letters. He speaks about what I have just told you. His letters include some things that are hard to understand. People who don't know better and aren't firm in the faith twist what he says. They twist the other Scriptures too. So they will be destroyed.",
  "17": "Dear friends, you already know that. So be on your guard. Then you won't be led down the wrong path by the mistakes of people who don't obey the law. You won't fall from your safe position.",
  "18": "Grow in the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Get to know him better. Give him glory both now and forever. Amen."
