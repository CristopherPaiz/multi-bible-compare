  "46": "But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me. I know that power has gone out from me.\"",
  "47": "The woman realized that people would notice her. Shaking with fear, she came and fell at his feet. In front of everyone, she told why she had touched him. She also told how she had been healed in an instant.",
