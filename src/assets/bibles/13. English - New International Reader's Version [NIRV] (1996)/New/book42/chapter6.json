  "3": "Jesus answered them, \"Haven't you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.",

  "9": "Then Jesus said to them, \"What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day? Should we do good? Or should we do evil? Should we save life? Or should we destroy it?\"",

  "22": "Blessed are you when people hate you, when they have nothing to do with you and say bad things about you, and when they treat your name as something evil. They do all this because you are followers of the Son of Man.",
  "23": "\"Their people treated the prophets the same way long ago. When these things happen to you, be glad and jump for joy. You will receive many blessings in heaven.",

  "33": "And suppose you do good to those who are good to you. Should anyone praise you for that? Even 'sinners' do that.",
  "34": "And suppose you lend money to those who can pay you back. Should anyone praise you for that? Even a 'sinner' lends to 'sinners,' expecting them to pay everything back.",

First take the piece of wood out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend's eye.",
  "43": "\"A good tree doesn't bear bad fruit. And a bad tree doesn't bear good fruit.",
