  "10": "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them were the ones who told the apostles.",
  "11": "But the apostles did not believe the women. Their words didn't make any sense to them.",
  "12": "But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent over and saw the strips of linen lying by themselves. Then he went away, wondering what had happened.",

  "33": "They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them. They were all gathered together.",
  "34": "They were saying, \"It's true! The Lord has risen! He has appeared to Simon!\"",
  "35": "Then the two of them told what had happened to them on the way. They told how they had recognized Jesus when he broke the bread.",

  "38": "Jesus said to them, \"Why are you troubled? Why do you have doubts in your minds?",
  "39": "Look at my hands and my feet. It is really I! Touch me and see. A ghost does not have a body or bones. But you can see that I do.\"",
  "40": "After he said that, he showed them his hands and feet.",
  "41": "But they still did not believe it. They were amazed and filled with joy. So Jesus asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\"",
