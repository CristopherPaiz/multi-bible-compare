  "1": "Jesus finished saying all those things to the people. Then he entered Capernaum.",
  "2": "There the servant of a Roman commander was sick and about to die. His master thought highly of him.",
  "3": "The commander heard about Jesus. So he sent some elders of the Jews to him. He told them to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant.",
  "4": "They came to Jesus and begged him, \"This man deserves to have you do this.",
  "5": "He loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\"",
  "6": "So Jesus went with them. When Jesus came near the house, the Roman commander sent friends to him. He told them to say, \"Lord, don't trouble yourself. I am not good enough to have you come into my house.",
  "7": "That is why I did not even think I was fit to come to you. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.",
  "8": "I myself am a man who is under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\"",
  "9": "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. He turned to the crowd that was following him. He said, \"I tell you, even in Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong.\"",
  "10": "Then the men who had been sent to Jesus returned to the house. They found that the servant was healed.",
  "11": "Some time later, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went along with him.",
  "12": "He approached the town gate. Just then, a dead person was being carried out. He was the only son of his mother. She was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her.",
  "13": "When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her. So he said, \"Don't cry.\"",
  "14": "Then he went up and touched the coffin. Those carrying it stood still. Jesus said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\"",
  "15": "The dead man sat up and began to talk. Then Jesus gave him back to his mother.",
  "16": "The people were all filled with wonder and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\"",
  "17": "This news about Jesus spread all through Judea and the whole country.",
  "18": "John's disciples told him about all these things. So he chose two of them.",
  "19": "He sent them to the Lord. They were to ask Jesus, \"Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?\"",
  "20": "The men came to Jesus. They said, \"John the Baptist sent us to ask you, 'Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?' \"",
  "21": "At that very time Jesus healed many people. They had illnesses, sicknesses and evil spirits. He also gave sight to many who were blind.",
  "22": "So Jesus replied to the messengers, \"Go back to John. Tell him what you have seen and heard. Blind people receive sight. Disabled people walk. Those who have skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. Those who are dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who are poor.",
  "23": "Blessed are those who do not give up their faith because of me.\"",
  "24": "So John's messengers left. Then Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, \"What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass waving in the wind?",
  "25": "If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes and have many expensive things are in palaces.",
  "26": "Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.",
  "27": "\"He is the one written about in Scripture. It says, \" 'I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way for you.' --(Malachi 3:1)",
  "28": "I tell you, no one more important than John has ever been born. But the least important person in God's kingdom is more important than he is.\"",
  "29": "All the people who heard Jesus' words agreed that God's way was right. Even the tax collectors agreed. These people had all been baptized by John.",
  "30": "But the Pharisees and the authorities on the law did not accept God's purpose for themselves. They had not been baptized by John.",
  "31": "\"What can I compare today's people to?\" Jesus asked. \"What are they like?",
  "32": "They are like children sitting in the market place and calling out to each other. They say, \" 'We played a flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't cry.'",
  "33": "\"That is how it has been with John the Baptist. When he came to you, he didn't eat bread or drink wine. And you say, 'He has a demon.'",
  "34": "But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank as you do. And you say, 'This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much. He's a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\" '",
  "35": "All who follow wisdom prove that wisdom is right.\"",
  "36": "One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him. So he went to the Pharisee's house. He took his place at the table.",
  "37": "There was a woman in that town who had lived a sinful life. She learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house. So she came with a special sealed jar of perfume.",
  "38": "She stood behind Jesus and cried at his feet. She began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair. She kissed them and poured perfume on them.",
  "39": "The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this. He said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him. He would know what kind of woman she is. She is a sinner!\"",
  "40": "Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.\" \"Tell me, teacher,\" he said.",
  "41": "\"Two people owed money to a certain lender. One owed him 500 silver coins. The other owed him 50 silver coins.",
  "42": "Neither of them had the money to pay him back. So he let them go without paying. Which of them will love him more?\"",
  "43": "Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who owed the most money.\" \"You are right,\" Jesus said.",
  "44": "Then he turned toward the woman. He said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water to wash my feet. But she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.",
  "45": "You did not give me a kiss. But this woman has not stopped kissing my feet since I came in.",
  "46": "You did not put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured perfume on my feet.",
  "47": "So I tell you this. Her many sins have been forgiven. She has loved a lot. But the one who has been forgiven little loves only a little.\"",
  "48": "Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\"",
  "49": "The other guests began to talk about this among themselves. They said, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\"",
  "50": "Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\""
