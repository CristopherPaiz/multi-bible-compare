  "3": "I myself have carefully looked into everything from the beginning. So it seemed good also to me to write down an orderly report of exactly what happened. I am doing this for you, most excellent Theophilus.",
  "4": "I want you to know that the things you have been taught are true.",
  "5": "Herod was king of Judea. During the time he was ruling, there was a priest named Zechariah. He belonged to a group of priests named after Abijah. His wife Elizabeth also came from the family line of Aaron.",
  "6": "Both of them did what was right in God's eyes. They obeyed all the Lord's commandments and rules faithfully.",

  "9": "He happened to be chosen, in the usual way, to go into the temple of the Lord. There he was supposed to burn incense.",
  "10": "The time came for this to be done. All who had gathered to worship were praying outside.",
  "11": "Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah. The angel was standing at the right side of the incense altar.",
  "12": "When Zechariah saw him, he was amazed and terrified.",

  "18": "Zechariah asked the angel, \"How can I be sure of this? I am an old man, and my wife is old too.\"",
  "19": "The angel answered, \"I am Gabriel. I serve God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.",
  "20": "And now you will have to be silent. You will not be able to speak until after John is born. That's because you did not believe my words. They will come true when the time is right.\"",
  "21": "During that time, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out. They wondered why he stayed in the temple so long.",
  "22": "When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple. They knew this because he kept motioning to them. He still could not speak.",
  "23": "When his time of service was over, he returned home.",
  "24": "After that, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant. She stayed at home for five months.",
  "25": "\"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said. \"In these days, he has been kind to me. He has taken away my shame among the people.\"",
  "26": "In the sixth month after Elizabeth had become pregnant, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee.",

  "33": "He will rule forever over his people, who came from Jacob's family. His kingdom will never end.\"",
  "34": "\"How can this happen?\" Mary asked the angel. \"I am a virgin.\"",
  "35": "The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come to you. The power of the Most High God will cover you. So the holy one that is born will be called the Son of God.",
  "36": "Your relative Elizabeth is old. And even she is going to have a child. People thought she could not have children. But she has been pregnant for six months now.",
  "37": "Nothing is impossible with God.\"",
  "38": "\"I serve the Lord,\" Mary answered. \"May it happen to me just as you said it would.\" Then the angel left her.",

  "45": "You are a woman God has blessed. You have believed that what the Lord has said to you will be done!\"",
  "46": "Mary said, \"My soul gives glory to the Lord.",
  "47": "My spirit delights in God my Savior.",
  "48": "He has taken note of me even though I am not important. From now on all people will call me blessed.",
  "49": "The Mighty One has done great things for me. His name is holy.",
  "50": "He shows his mercy to those who have respect for him, from parent to child down through the years.",
  "51": "He has done mighty things with his arm. He has scattered those who are proud in their deepest thoughts.",
  "52": "He has brought down rulers from their thrones. But he has lifted up people who are not important.",
  "53": "He has filled those who are hungry with good things. But he has sent those who are rich away empty.",
  "54": "He has helped the people of Israel, who serve him. He has always remembered to be kind",
  "55": "to Abraham and his children down through the years. He has done it just as he said to our people of long ago.\"",

  "60": "But his mother spoke up. \"No!\" she said. \"He must be called John.\"",
  "61": "They said to her, \"No one among your relatives has that name.\"",
  "62": "Then they motioned to his father. They wanted to find out what he would like to name the child.",
  "63": "He asked for something to write on. Then he wrote, \"His name is John.\" Everyone was amazed.",
  "64": "Right away Zechariah could speak again. His first words gave praise to God.",
  "65": "The neighbors were all filled with fear and wonder. All through Judea's hill country, people were talking about all these things.",
  "66": "Everyone who heard this wondered about it. And because the Lord was with John, they asked, \"What is this child going to be?\"",
  "67": "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit. He prophesied,",
  "68": "\"Give praise to the Lord, the God of Israel! He has come and set his people free.",
  "69": "He has acted with great power and has saved us. He did it for those who are from the family line of his servant David.",
  "70": "Long ago holy prophets said he would do it.",
  "71": "He has saved us from our enemies. We are rescued from all who hate us.",
  "72": "He has been kind to our people. He has remembered his holy covenant.",
  "73": "He made an oath to our father Abraham.",
  "74": "He promised to save us from our enemies, so that we could serve him without fear.",
  "75": "He wants us to be holy and godly as long as we live.",
  "76": "\"And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High God. You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare the way for him.",
  "77": "You will tell his people how they can be saved. You will tell them that their sins can be forgiven.",
  "78": "All of that will happen because our God is tender and caring. His kindness will bring the rising sun to us from heaven.",
  "79": "It will shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death. It will guide our feet on the path of peace.\"",
