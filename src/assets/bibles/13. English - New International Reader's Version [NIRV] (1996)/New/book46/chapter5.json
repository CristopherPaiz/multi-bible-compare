  "1": "It is actually reported that there is sexual sin among you. I'm told that a man is living with his father's wife and is having sex with her. Even people who do not know God don't commit that sin.",
  "2": "And you are proud! Shouldn't you be filled with sadness instead? Shouldn't you have put the man who did that out of your church?",
  "3": "Even though I am not right there with you, I am with you in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did that, just as if I were there.",
  "4": "When you come together in the name of our Lord Jesus, I will be with you in spirit. The power of our Lord Jesus will also be with you.",
  "5": "When you come together like that, hand that man over to Satan. Then his sinful nature will be destroyed. His spirit will be saved on the day the Lord returns.",

  "8": "So let us keep the Feast, but not with the old yeast. I'm talking about yeast that is full of hatred and evil. Let us keep the Feast with bread made without yeast. Let us do it with bread that is honest and true.",
  "9": "I wrote a letter to you to tell you to stay away from people who commit sexual sins.",
  "10": "I didn't mean the people of this world who sin that way or who always want more and more. I didn't mean those who cheat or who worship statues of gods. In that case you would have to leave this world!",
  "11": "But here is what I am writing to you. You must stay away from anyone who claims to be a believer but who does those things. Stay away from anyone who commits sexual sins or who always wants more and more things. Stay away from a person who worships statues of gods or who tells lies about others. Stay away from anyone who gets drunk or who cheats. Don't even eat with a person like that.",
  "12": "Is it my business to judge those outside the church? Aren't you supposed to judge those inside the church?",
  "13": "God will judge those outside. Scripture says, \"Get rid of that evil person!\"--(Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21,24; 24:7)"
