  "1": "Suppose I speak in the languages of human beings and of angels. If I don't have love, I am only a loud gong or a noisy cymbal.",
  "2": "Suppose I have the gift of prophecy. Suppose I can understand all the secret things of God and know everything about him. And suppose I have enough faith to move mountains. If I don't have love, I am nothing at all.",
  "3": "Suppose I give everything I have to poor people. And suppose I give my body to be burned. If I don't have love, I get nothing at all.",
  "4": "Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not want what belongs to others. It does not brag. It is not proud.",
  "5": "It is not rude. It does not look out for its own interests. It does not easily become angry. It does not keep track of other people's wrongs.",
  "6": "Love is not happy with evil. But it is full of joy when the truth is spoken.",
  "7": "It always protects. It always trusts. It always hopes. It never gives up.",

  "10": "But when what is perfect comes, the things that are not perfect will pass away.",
  "11": "When I was a child, I talked like a child. I thought like a child. I had the understanding of a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.",
  "12": "Now we see only a dim likeness of things. It is as if we were seeing them in a mirror. But someday we will see clearly. We will see face to face. What I know now is not complete. But someday I will know completely, just as God knows me completely.",
  "13": "The three most important things to have are faith, hope and love. But the greatest of them is love."
