  "1": "Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ.",
  "2": "I praise you for being faithful in remembering me. I also praise you for staying true to all my teachings, just as I gave them to you.",
  "3": "Now I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ. The head of the woman is the man. And the head of Christ is God.",
  "4": "Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame on his head.",
  "5": "And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame on her head. It is just as if her head were shaved.",
  "6": "What if a woman does not cover her head? She should have her hair cut off. But it is shameful for her to cut her hair or shave it off. So she should cover her head.",
  "7": "A man should not cover his head. He is the likeness and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.",
  "8": "The man did not come from the woman. The woman came from the man.",
  "9": "Also, the man was not created for the woman. The woman was created for the man.",
  "10": "That's why a woman should have her head covered. It shows that she is under authority. She should also cover her head because of the angels.",
  "11": "But here is how things are for those who belong to the Lord. The woman is not independent of the man. And the man is not independent of the woman.",
  "12": "The woman came from the man, and the man is born from the woman. But everything comes from God.",
  "13": "You be the judge. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without covering her head?",
  "14": "Suppose a man has long hair. Doesn't the very nature of things teach you that it is shameful?",
  "15": "And suppose a woman has long hair. Doesn't the very nature of things teach you that it is her glory? Long hair is given to her as a covering.",
  "16": "If anyone wants to argue about that, we don't have any other practice. And God's churches don't either.",
  "17": "In the following matters, I don't praise you. Your meetings do more harm than good.",
  "18": "First, here is what people are telling me. When you come together as a church, you take sides. And in some ways I believe it.",
  "19": "No doubt you need to take sides in order to show which of you God agrees with!",
  "20": "When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat.",
  "21": "As you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anyone else. One remains hungry and another gets drunk.",
  "22": "Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you think so little of God's church that you shame those in it who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you for that? Certainly not!",
  "23": "I passed on to you what I received from the Lord. On the night the Lord Jesus was handed over to his enemies, he took bread.",
  "24": "When he had given thanks, he broke it. He said, \"This is my body. It is given for you. Every time you eat it, do it in memory of me.\"",
  "25": "In the same way, after supper he took the cup. He said, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Every time you drink it, do it in memory of me.\"",
  "26": "When you eat the bread and drink the cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.",
  "27": "So do not eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that isn't worthy of him. If you do, you will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "A person should take a careful look at himself before he eats the bread and drinks from the cup.",
  "29": "Anyone who eats and drinks must recognize the body of the Lord. If he doesn't, God will judge him for it.",
  "30": "That is why many of you are weak and sick. That is why a number of you have died.",
  "31": "We should judge ourselves. Then we would not be found guilty.",
  "32": "When the Lord judges us, he corrects us. Then we will not be judged along with the rest of the world.",
  "33": "My brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.",
  "34": "Those who are hungry should eat at home. Then when you come together, you will not be judged. When I come, I will give you more directions."
