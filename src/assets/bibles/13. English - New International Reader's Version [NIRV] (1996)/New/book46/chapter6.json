  "1": "Suppose one of you wants to bring a charge against another believer. Should you take it to the ungodly to be judged? Why not take it to God's people?",
  "2": "Don't you know that God's people will judge the world? And if you are going to judge the world, aren't you able to judge small cases?",
  "3": "Don't you know that we will judge angels? Then we should be able to judge the things of this life even more!",
  "4": "So if you want to press charges in matters like that, appoint as judges members of the church who aren't very important!",
  "5": "I say this to shame you. Is it possible that no one among you is wise enough to judge matters between believers?",
  "6": "Instead, one believer goes to court against another. And this happens in front of unbelievers!",
  "7": "The very fact that you take another believer to court means you have lost the battle already. Why not be treated wrongly? Why not be cheated?",
  "8": "Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong. And you do it to your brothers and sisters.",
  "9": "Don't you know that evil people will not receive God's kingdom? Don't be fooled. Those who commit sexual sins will not receive the kingdom. Neither will those who worship statues of gods or commit adultery. Neither will men who are prostitutes or who commit homosexual acts.",
  "10": "Neither will thieves or those who always want more and more. Neither will those who are often drunk or tell lies or cheat. People who live like that will not receive God's kingdom.",
  "11": "Some of you used to do those things. But your sins were washed away. You were made holy. You were made right with God. All of that was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.",
  "12": "Some of you say, \"Everything is permitted for me.\" But not everything is good for me. Again some of you say, \"Everything is permitted for me.\" But I will not be controlled by anything.",
  "13": "Some of you say, \"Food is for the stomach. And the stomach is for food.\" But God will destroy both of them. The body is not meant for sexual sins. The body is meant for the Lord. And the Lord is meant for the body.",
  "14": "By his power God raised the Lord from the dead. He will also raise us up.",
  "15": "Don't you know that your bodies belong to the body of Christ? Should I take what belongs to Christ and join it to a prostitute? Never!",
  "16": "Don't you know that when you join yourself to a prostitute, you become one with her in body? Scripture says, \"The two will become one.\"--(Genesis 2:24)",
  "17": "But anyone who is joined to the Lord becomes one with him in spirit.",
  "18": "Keep far away from sexual sins. All the other sins a person commits are outside his body. But sexual sins are sins against one's own body.",
  "19": "Don't you know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit? The Spirit is in you. You have received him from God. You do not belong to yourselves.",
  "20": "Christ has paid the price for you. So use your bodies in a way that honors God."
