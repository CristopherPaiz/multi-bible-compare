You have taken off your royal robe right in front of the female slaves of your officials. You acted like someone who is very foolish!\"",
  "21": "David said to Michal, \"I did it to honor the Lord. He chose me instead of your father or anyone else in Saul's family. He appointed me ruler over his people Israel. I will celebrate in honor of the Lord.",
