  "2": "\"The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me. I spoke his word with my tongue.",

  "5": "\"Isn't my royal family right with God? Hasn't he made a covenant with me that will last forever? Every part of it was well prepared and made secure. Won't he save me completely? Won't he give me everything I long for?",
  "6": "But evil people are like thorns that are thrown away. You can't pick them up with your hands.",
  "7": "Even if you touch them, you must use an iron tool or a spear. Thorns are burned up right where they are.\"",

  "9": "Next to him was Eleazar. He was one of the three mighty men. He was the son of Dodai, the Ahohite. Eleazar was with David at Pas Dammim. That's where Israel's army made fun of the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. Then the men of Israel pulled back.",
  "10": "But Eleazar stayed right where he was. He struck the Philistines down until his hand grew tired. But he still held on to his sword. The Lord helped him win a great battle that day. The troops returned to Eleazar. They came back to him only to take what they wanted from the dead bodies.",
  "11": "Next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee. Shammah was a Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at a place where there was a field full of lentils. Israel's troops ran away from them.",

  "15": "David longed for water. He said, \"I wish someone would get me a drink of water from the well that is near the gate of Bethlehem.\"",
  "16": "So the three mighty men fought their way past the Philistine guards. They got some water from the well that was near the gate of Bethlehem. They took the water back to David. But David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord.",
  "17": "\"Lord, I would never drink that water!\" David said. \"It stands for the blood of these men. They put their lives in danger by going to Bethlehem to get it.\" So David wouldn't drink it. Those were some of the brave things the three mighty men did.",

  "20": "Benaiah was a great hero from Kabzeel. He was the son of Jehoiada. Benaiah did many brave things. He struck down two of Moab's best fighting men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day. He killed a lion there.",
  "21": "And he struck down a huge Egyptian. The Egyptian was holding a spear. Benaiah went out to fight against him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian's hand. Then he killed him with it.",
  "22": "Those were some of the brave things Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, did. He too was as famous as the three mighty men were.",
  "23": "He was honored more than any of the Thirty. But he wasn't included among the Three. David put him in charge of his own personal guards.",
