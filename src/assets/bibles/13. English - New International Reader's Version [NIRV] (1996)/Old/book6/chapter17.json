  "1": "Land was given to the tribe of Manasseh. It was given to Makir. Manasseh was Joseph's oldest son. Makir was Manasseh's oldest son. The people of Gilead came from the family line of Makir. The people of Gilead had received the lands of Gilead and Bashan. That's because the people of Makir were great soldiers.",
  "2": "So land was given to the rest of the people of Manasseh. It was given to the family groups of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. They were the other men in the family line of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. Those were their names by their family groups.",
  "3": "Makir was the son of Manasseh. Gilead was the son of Makir. Hepher was the son of Gilead. And Zelophehad was the son of Hepher. Zelophehad didn't have any sons. He only had daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.",
  "4": "The daughters of Zelophehad went to the priest Eleazar and to Joshua, the son of Nun. They also went to the other leaders. They said, \"The Lord commanded Moses to give us our share of land among our male relatives.\" So Joshua gave them land along with their male relatives. That was in keeping with what the Lord had commanded.",
  "5": "Manasseh's share was made up of ten pieces of land. That land was in addition to Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River.",
  "6": "So the five granddaughters of Hepher in the family line of Manasseh received land, just as the other five sons of Manasseh did. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the family line of Manasseh.",
  "7": "The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Micmethath. Micmethath was east of Shechem. The border ran south from Micmethath. The people who were living at En Tappuah were inside the border.",
  "8": "Manasseh had the land around Tappuah. But the town of Tappuah itself was on the border of Manasseh's land. It belonged to the people of Ephraim.",
  "9": "The border continued south to the Kanah Valley. Some of the towns that belonged to Ephraim were located among the towns of Manasseh. But the border of Manasseh was the north side of the valley. The border came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea.",
  "10": "The land on the south belonged to Ephraim. The land on the north belonged to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea. The tribe of Asher was the border on the north. The tribe of Issachar was the border on the east.",
  "11": "Inside the land that was given to Issachar and Asher, the towns of Beth Shan and Ibleam belonged to Manasseh. The towns of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo and their people also belonged to Manasseh. Manasseh was given all of those towns and the settlements that were around them. The third town in the list was also called Naphoth Dor.",
  "12": "But the people of Manasseh weren't able to take over those towns. That's because the people of Canaan had made up their minds to live in that area.",
  "13": "The people of Israel grew stronger. Then they forced the people of Canaan to work hard for them. But they didn't drive them out completely.",
  "14": "The people in the family line of Joseph spoke to Joshua. They said, \"Why have you given us only one share of the land to have as our own? There are large numbers of us. The Lord has blessed us greatly.\"",
  "15": "\"That's true,\" Joshua said. \"There are large numbers of you. And the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you. So go up into the forest. Clear out some land for yourselves in the territory of the Perizzites and Rephaites.\"",
  "16": "The people in Joseph's family line replied. They said, \"The hill country isn't big enough for us. And all of the people of Canaan who live in the flatlands use chariots that have iron parts. They include the people of Beth Shan and its settlements. They also include the people who live in the Valley of Jezreel.\"",
  "17": "Joshua spoke again to the people in Joseph's family line. He said to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh, \"There are large numbers of you. And you are very powerful. You will have more than one piece of land.",
  "18": "You will also have the central hill country. It's covered with trees. Cut them down and clear the land. That whole land from one end to the other will belong to you. The people of Canaan use chariots that have iron parts. And those people are strong. But you can drive them out.\""
