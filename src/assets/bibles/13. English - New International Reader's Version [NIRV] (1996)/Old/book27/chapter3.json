  "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a statue that was covered with gold. It was 90 feet tall and 9 feet wide. He set it up on the flatlands of Dura near the city of Babylon.",
  "2": "Then the king sent for the royal rulers, high officials and governors. He sent for the advisers, treasurers, judges and court officers. And he sent for all of the other officials of Babylon. He asked them to come to a special gathering to honor the statue he had set up.",
  "3": "So the royal rulers, high officials and governors came together. So did the advisers, treasurers, judges and court officers. All of the other officials joined them. They came to honor the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They stood in front of it.",
  "4": "Then a messenger called out loudly, \"Listen, you people who come from every nation! Pay attention, you who speak other languages! Here is what the king commands you to do.",
  "5": "You will soon hear the sound of horns and flutes. You will hear zithers, lyres, harps and pipes. In fact, you will hear all kinds of music. When you do, you must fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.",
  "6": "If you don't, you will be thrown into a blazing furnace right away.\"",
  "7": "All of the people heard the sound of the horns and flutes. They heard the zithers, lyres, harps and other musical instruments. As soon as they did, they fell down and worshiped Nebuchadnezzar's gold statue. They had come from every nation and language.",
  "8": "At that time some people who studied the heavens came forward. They spoke against the Jews.",
  "9": "They said, \"King Nebuchadnezzar, may you live forever!",
  "10": "You commanded everyone to fall down and worship the gold statue. You told them to do it when they heard the horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps, pipes and other musical instruments.",
  "11": "If they didn't, they would be thrown into a blazing furnace.",
  "12": "But you have appointed some Jews to help Daniel govern Babylon and the towns around it. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They don't pay any attention to you, King Nebuchadnezzar. They don't serve your gods. And they refuse to worship the gold statue you have set up.\"",
  "13": "Nebuchadnezzar burned with anger. He sent for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So they were brought to him.",
  "14": "The king said to them, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, is what I heard about you true? Don't you serve my gods? Don't you worship the gold statue I set up?",
  "15": "You will hear the horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps, pipes and other musical instruments. When you do, fall down and worship the statue I made. If you will, that's very good. But if you won't, you will be thrown at once into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to save you from my powerful hand?\"",
  "16": "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king. They said, \"King Nebuchadnezzar, we don't need to talk about this anymore.",
  "17": "We might be thrown into the blazing furnace. But the God we serve is able to bring us out of it alive. He will save us from your powerful hand.",
  "18": "\"But we want you to know this. Even if we knew that our God wouldn't save us, we still wouldn't serve your gods. We wouldn't worship the gold statue you set up.\"",
  "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar's anger burned against Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. The look on his face changed. And he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual.",
  "20": "He also gave some of the strongest soldiers in his army a command. He ordered them to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Then he told his men to throw them into the blazing furnace.",
  "21": "So they were tied up. Then they were thrown into the furnace. They were wearing their robes, pants, turbans and other clothes.",
  "22": "The king's command was carried out quickly. The furnace was so hot that its flames killed the soldiers who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into it.",
  "23": "So the three men were firmly tied up. And they fell into the blazing furnace.",
  "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet. He was so amazed he asked his advisers, \"Didn't we tie three men up? Didn't we throw three men into the fire?\" \"Yes, we did,\" they replied.",
  "25": "The king said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire. They aren't tied up. And the fire hasn't even harmed them. The fourth man looks like a son of the gods.\"",
  "26": "Then the king approached the opening of the blazing furnace. He shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, come out! You who serve the Most High God, come here!\" So they came out of the fire.",
  "27": "The royal rulers, high officials, governors and advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire hadn't harmed their bodies. Not one hair on their heads was burned. Their robes weren't burned either. And they didn't even smell like smoke.",
  "28": "Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"May the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be praised! He has sent his angel and saved his servants. They trusted in him. They refused to obey my command. They were willing to give up their lives. They would rather die than serve or worship any god except their own God.",
  "29": "\"No other god can save people that way. So I'm giving an order. No one from any nation or language can say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. If they do, they'll be cut to pieces. And their houses will be turned into piles of trash.\"",
  "30": "Then the king honored Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. He gave them higher positions in the city of Babylon and the towns around it."
