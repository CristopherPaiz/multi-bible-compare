  "5": "\"People of Jacob, your tents are very beautiful. Israel, the places where you live are very beautiful.",

  "13": "I said, 'Balak could give me his palace filled with silver and gold. Even if I wanted to, I still couldn't do anything at all that goes beyond what the Lord commands. I have to say only what the Lord tells me to say.'",
