  "3": "\"We have seen the cities of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah and Heshbon. We've seen Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon.",
  "4": "All of them are in the land the Lord has brought under Israel's control. This land is just right for livestock. And we have livestock.",
  "5": "\"We hope you are pleased with us,\" they continued. \"If you are, please give us this land. Then it will belong to us. But don't make us go across the Jordan River.\"",

  "11": "\"Not one of the men who is 20 years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land. They have not followed me with their whole heart. I took an oath and promised to give the land to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",

  "14": "\"Now here you are, you bunch of sinners! You have taken the place of your fathers. And you are making the Lord even more angry with Israel.",
  "15": "What if you turn away from following him? Then he'll leave all of these people in the desert again. And it will be your fault when they are destroyed.\"",
  "16": "Then they came up to Moses. They said, \"We would like to build pens here for our livestock. We would also like to build cities for our women and children.",
  "17": "\"But we're ready to prepare ourselves for battle. We're even ready to go ahead of the people of Israel. We'll go with them until we've brought them to their place.

  "18": "\"We won't return to our homes until all of the people of Israel have received their share of the land.",

  "29": "He said, \"The men of Gad and Reuben must prepare themselves for battle. They must go across the Jordan River with you. They must help you fight for the Lord. They must stay with you until the land has been brought under your control. If they do, give them the land of Gilead as their own.",
  "30": "\"But what if they don't get ready for battle? What if they don't go across the Jordan with you? Then they must accept a share with you in Canaan.\"",
  "31": "The people of Gad and Reuben gave their answer. They said, \"We will do what the Lord has said.",

  "33": "Then Moses gave their land to them. He gave it to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh. Manasseh was Joseph's son. One part of that land had belonged to the kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites. The other part had belonged to the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan.
