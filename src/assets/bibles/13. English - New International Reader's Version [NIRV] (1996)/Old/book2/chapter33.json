  "2": "I will send an angel ahead of you. I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.",
  "3": "\"Go up to the land that has plenty of milk and honey. But I will not go with you. You are stubborn. I might destroy you on the way.\"",
  "4": "When the people heard those painful words, they became sad and began to sob. No one put on any jewelry.",
  "5": "The Lord had said to Moses, \"Tell the people of Israel, 'You are stubborn. If I went with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your jewelry. Then I will decide what to do with you.' \"",

  "7": "Moses used to take a tent and set it up far outside the camp. He called it the \"tent of meeting.\" Anyone who wanted to ask the Lord a question would go to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.",
  "8": "When Moses would go out to the tent, all of the people would get up and stand at the entrances to their tents. They would watch Moses until he entered the tent.",
  "9": "As Moses would go into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down. It would stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.",

  "11": "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face. It was like a man speaking to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp. But Joshua, his young helper, didn't leave the tent. Joshua was the son of Nun.",
  "12": "Moses said to the Lord, \"You have been telling me, 'Lead these people.' But you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know your name. I know all about you. And I am pleased with you.'",
  "13": "If you are pleased with me, teach me more about yourself. Then I can know you. And I can continue to please you. Remember that this nation is your people.\"",
  "14": "The Lord replied, \"I will go with you. And I will give you rest.\"",
  "15": "Then Moses said to him, \"If you don't go with us, don't send us up from here.",
  "16": "How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and your people? You must go with us. How else will we be different from all of the other people on the face of the earth?\"",
  "17": "The Lord said to Moses, \"I will do exactly what you have asked. I am pleased with you. And I know your name. I know all about you.\"",

  "21": "The Lord continued, \"There is a place near me where you can stand on a rock.",
  "22": "When my glory passes by, I will put you in an opening in the rock. I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.",
  "23": "Then I will remove my hand. You will see my back. But my face must not be seen.\""
