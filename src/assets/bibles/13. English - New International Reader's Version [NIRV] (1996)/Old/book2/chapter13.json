  "13": "By sacrificing a lamb, buy back every male donkey that is born first to its mother. But if you don't buy the donkey back, break its neck. Buy back every oldest son.",
  "14": "\"In days to come, your son will ask you, 'What does this mean?' \"When he does, say to him, 'The Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt. That's the land where we were slaves.",

  "16": "\"This day will be like a mark on your hand. It will be like a sign on your forehead. It will remind you that the Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt.\"",
