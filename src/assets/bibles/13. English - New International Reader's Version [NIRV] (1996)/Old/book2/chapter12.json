  "11": "\"Eat the meat while your coat is tucked into your belt. Put your sandals on your feet. Take your walking stick in your hand. Eat the food quickly. It is the Lord's Passover.",
  "12": "\"That same night I will pass through Egypt. I will strike down every oldest son. I will also kill all of the male animals that were born first to their mothers. And I will judge all of the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.",
  "13": "\"The blood on your houses will be a sign for you. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. No deadly plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.",
  "14": "\"Always remember this day. For all time to come, you and your children after you must celebrate this day as a feast in honor of the Lord. It is a law that will last forever.",
  "15": "\"Eat bread made without yeast for seven days. On the first day remove the yeast from your homes. For the next seven days, anyone who eats anything that has yeast in it must be cut off from Israel.",
  "16": "\"On the first and seventh days, come together for a special service. Do not work at all on those days. All you are allowed to do is prepare food for everyone to eat.",
  "17": "\"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. I brought you out of Egypt on this very day like an army on the march. It is a law that will last for all time to come.",
  "18": "In the first month eat bread that is made without yeast. Eat it from the evening of the 14th day until the evening of the 21st day.",
  "19": "\"For seven days do not let any yeast be found in your homes. Anyone who eats anything that has yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. That applies to outsiders and Israelites alike.",

  "26": "\"Your children will ask you, 'What does this holy day mean to you?'",
  "27": "Tell them, 'It's the Passover sacrifice in honor of the Lord. He passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt. He spared our homes when he struck the Egyptians down.' \" Then the people of Israel bowed down and worshiped.",
  "28": "They did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.",
  "29": "At midnight the Lord struck down every oldest son in Egypt. He killed the oldest son of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne. He killed all of the oldest sons of prisoners, who were in prison. He also killed all of the male animals that were born first to their mothers among the livestock.",
  "30": "Pharaoh and all of his officials got up during the night. So did all of the Egyptians. There was loud crying in Egypt because someone had died in every home.",
  "31": "During the night, Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. He said to them, \"Get out of here! You and the Israelites, leave my people! Go. Worship the Lord, just as you have asked.",
  "32": "Go. Take your flocks and herds, just as you have said. And also give me your blessing.\"",

  "35": "They did just as Moses had directed them. They asked the Egyptians for articles that were made out of silver and gold. They also asked them for clothes.",
  "36": "The Lord had caused the Egyptians to treat the people of Israel in a kind way. So they gave them what they asked for. The people of Israel took many expensive things that belonged to the Egyptians.",
  "37": "The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth. There were about 600,000 men who were old enough to go into battle. The women and children went with them.",
  "38": "So did many other people. The Israelites also took large flocks and herds with them.",
  "39": "They brought dough from Egypt. With it they baked bread without yeast. The dough didn't have any yeast in it. That's because the people had been driven out of Egypt before they had time to prepare their food.",
  "40": "The people of Israel lived in Egypt for 430 years.",
  "41": "At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all of the Lord's people marched out of Egypt like an army.",
