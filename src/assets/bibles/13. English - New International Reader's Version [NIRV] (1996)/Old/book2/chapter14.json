  "5": "The king of Egypt was told that the people had gotten away. Then Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them. They said, \"What have we done? We've let the people of Israel go! We've lost our slaves and all of the work they used to do for us!\"",

  "7": "He took 600 of the best chariots in Egypt. He also took along all of the other chariots. Officers were in charge of all of them.",
  "8": "The Lord made the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, stubborn. So he chased the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.",
  "9": "The Egyptians went after the Israelites. All of Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen and troops went after them. They caught up with them as they camped by the sea. The Israelites were near Pi Hahiroth, across from Baal Zephon.",
  "10": "As Pharaoh approached, the people of Israel looked up. There were the Egyptians marching after them! The Israelites were terrified. They cried out to the Lord.",
  "11": "They said to Moses, \"Why did you bring us to the desert to die? Weren't there any graves in Egypt? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?",
  "12": "We told you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone. Let us serve the Egyptians.' It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die here in the desert!\"",
  "13": "Moses answered the people. He said, \"Don't be afraid. Stand firm. You will see how the Lord will save you today. Do you see those Egyptians? You will never see them again.",

  "17": "\"I will make the hearts of the Egyptians stubborn. They will go in after the Israelites. I will gain glory for myself because of what will happen to Pharaoh, his whole army, his chariots and his horsemen.",

  "19": "The angel of God had been traveling in front of Israel's army. Now he moved back and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved away from in front of them. Now it stood behind them.",

  "26": "Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, \"Reach your hand out over the sea. The waters will flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.\"",
