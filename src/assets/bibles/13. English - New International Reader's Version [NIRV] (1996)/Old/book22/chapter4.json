  "1": "The king says to the Shulammite woman, \"You are so beautiful, my love! So beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are like doves. Your hair flows like a flock of black goats coming down from Mount Gilead.",
  "2": "Your teeth are as clean as a flock of sheep. Their wool has just been clipped. They have just come up from being washed. Each of your teeth has its twin. Not one of them is alone.",
  "3": "Your lips are like a bright red ribbon. Your mouth is so lovely. Your cheeks behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.",
  "4": "Your neck is strong and beautiful like the tower of David. That tower is built with beautiful stones. A thousand shields are hanging on it. All of them belong to mighty soldiers.",
  "5": "Your two breasts are lovely. They are like two young antelopes that eat among the lilies.",
  "6": "I will go to the mountain of myrrh. I'll go to the hill of incense. I'll stay there until the day begins and the shadows fade away.",
  "7": "Every part of you is so beautiful, my love. There is no flaw in you.",
  "8": "\"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride. Come with me from Lebanon. Come down from the top of Mount Amana. Come down from the top of Senir. Come to me from the peak of Mount Hermon. Leave the dens where the lions live. Leave the places in the mountains where the leopards stay.",
  "9": "My bride, you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes. My sister, you have stolen my heart with one jewel in your necklace.",
  "10": "My bride, your love is so delightful. My sister, your love makes me happier than wine does. Your perfume smells better than any spice.",
  "11": "Your lips are as sweet as a honeycomb, my bride. Milk and honey are under your tongue. Your clothes smell like the cedar trees in Lebanon.",
  "12": "My bride, you are like a garden that is locked up. My sister, you are like a spring of water that has a fence around it. You are like a fountain that is sealed up.",
  "13": "You are like trees whose branches are loaded with pomegranates, fine fruits, henna and nard,",
  "14": "with saffron, cane and cinnamon. You are like every kind of incense tree. You have myrrh, aloes and all of the finest spices.",
  "15": "You are like a fountain in a garden. You are like a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.\" The woman says,",
  "16": "\"Wake up, north wind! Come, south wind! Blow on my garden. Then its sweet smell will spread everywhere. Let my love come into his garden. Let him taste its fine fruits.\""
