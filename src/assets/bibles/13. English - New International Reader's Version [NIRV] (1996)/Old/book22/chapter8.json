  "1": "\"I wish you were like a brother to me. I wish my mother's breasts had nursed you. Then if I found you outside, I could kiss you. No one would look down on me.",
  "2": "I'd bring you to my mother's house. She taught me everything I know. I'd give you spiced wine to drink. It's the juice of my pomegranates.",
  "3": "Your left arm is under my head. Your right arm is around me.",
  "4": "Women of Jerusalem, take an oath and make me a promise. Don't stir up love. Don't wake it up until it's ready.\" The other women say,",
  "5": "\"Who is this woman coming up from the desert? She's leaning on the one who loves her.\" The woman says to the king, \"Under the apple tree I woke you up. That's where your mother became pregnant with you. She went into labor, and you were born there.",
  "6": "Hold me close to your heart like the seal around your neck. Keep me close to yourself like the ring on your finger. My love for you is so strong it won't let you go. Love is as powerful as death. Love's jealousy is as strong as the grave. Love is like a blazing fire. It burns like a mighty flame.",
  "7": "No amount of water can put it out. Rivers can't drown it. Suppose someone offers all of his wealth to buy love. That won't even come close to being enough.\" The woman's brothers say,",
  "8": "\"We have a little sister. Her breasts are still small. What should we do for our sister when she gets engaged?",
  "9": "If she were a wall, we'd build silver towers on her. If she were a door, we'd cover her with cedar boards.\" The woman says to the king,",
  "10": "\"I am a wall. My breasts are like well-built towers. So in your eyes I've become like someone who makes you happy.",
  "11": "Solomon, you had a vineyard in Baal Hamon. You rented your vineyard to others. They had to pay 25 pounds of silver for its fruit.",
  "12": "But I can give my own vineyard to anyone I want to. So I give my 25 pounds of silver to you, Solomon. Give 5 pounds to those who take care of its fruit.\" The king says,",
  "13": "\"My love, you live in the gardens. My friends listen for your voice. But let me hear it now.\" The woman says,",
  "14": "\"Come away with me, my love. Be like an antelope or like a young deer on mountains that are full of spices.\""
