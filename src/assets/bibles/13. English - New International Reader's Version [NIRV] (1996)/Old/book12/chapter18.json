  "4": "Hezekiah removed the high places. He smashed the sacred stones. He cut down the poles that were used to worship the goddess Asherah. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made. Up to that time the people of Israel had been burning incense to it. They called it Nehushtan.",
  "5": "Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all of the kings of Judah. There was no king like him either before him or after him.",
  "6": "Hezekiah remained true to the Lord. He didn't stop following him. He obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses.",
  "7": "The Lord was with Hezekiah. He was successful in everything he did. He refused to remain under the control of the king of Assyria. He didn't serve him.",
  "8": "He won the war against the Philistines. He won battles at their lookout towers. He won battles at their cities that had high walls around them. He won battles against the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its territory.",

  "11": "The king of Assyria took the people of Israel away from their own land. He sent them off to Assyria. He settled some of them in Halah. He settled others in Gozan on the Habor River. And he settled still others in the towns of the Medes.",
  "12": "Those things happened because the Israelites hadn't obeyed the Lord their God. They had broken the covenant he had made with them. They had refused to do everything Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded. They hadn't paid any attention to those commands. They hadn't obeyed them.",

  "14": "Hezekiah, the king of Judah, sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. It said, \"I have done what is wrong. Pull your troops back from me. Then I'll pay you anything you ask me to.\" The king of Assyria forced Hezekiah, the king of Judah, to give him 11 tons of silver. Hezekiah also had to give him a ton of gold.",

  "17": "The king of Assyria sent his highest commander from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. He also sent his chief officer and his field commander along with a large army. All of them came up to Jerusalem. They stopped at the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool. It was on the road to the Washerman's Field.",
  "18": "They called for King Hezekiah. Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to them. Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, was in charge of the palace. Shebna was the secretary. Joah, the son of Asaph, kept the records.",
  "19": "The field commander said to them, \"Give Hezekiah this message. Tell him, \" 'Sennacherib is the great king of Assyria. He says, \"Why are you putting your faith in what your king says?",
  "20": "You say you have a military plan. You say you have a strong army. But your words don't mean anything. Who are you depending on? Why don't you want to stay under my control?",
  "21": "\" ' \"You are depending on Egypt. Why are you doing that? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem. Try leaning on it. It will only cut your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who depends on him.",
  "22": "\" ' \"Suppose you say to me, 'We are depending on the Lord our God.' Didn't Hezekiah remove your god's high places and altars? Didn't Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship at the altar in Jerusalem'?",
  "23": "\" ' \"Come on. Make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I'll give you 2,000 horses. But only if you can put riders on them!",
  "24": "You are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen. You can't drive away even the least important officer among my master's officials.",
  "25": "\" ' \"Besides, do you think I've come without receiving a message from the Lord? Have I come to attack and destroy this place without a message from him? The Lord himself told me to march out against your country. He told me to destroy it.\" ' \"",
  "26": "Then Shebna, Joah and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, spoke to the field commander. They said, \"Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew. If you do, the people who are on the wall will be able to understand you.\"",
  "27": "But the commander replied, \"My master sent me to say these things. Are these words only for your master and you to hear? Aren't they also for the men who are sitting on the wall? They are going to suffer just like you. They'll have to eat their own waste. They'll have to drink their own urine.\"",
  "28": "Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language. He called out, \"Pay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you.",
  "29": "He says, 'Don't let Hezekiah trick you. He can't save you from my powerful hand.",
  "30": "Don't let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord. Don't believe him when he says, \"You can be sure that the Lord will save us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.\" '",
  "31": "\"Don't listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, 'Make a peace treaty with me. Come over to my side. Then every one of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree. Every one of you will drink water from your own well.",
  "32": "You will do that until I come back. Then I'll take you to a land that is just like yours. It's a land that has a lot of grain and fresh wine. It has plenty of bread and vineyards. It has olive trees and honey. So choose life! Don't choose death!' \"Don't pay any attention to Hezekiah. He's telling you a lie when he says, 'The Lord will save us.'",
  "33": "\"Has the god of any nation ever saved his land from the powerful hand of the king of Assyria?",
  "34": "Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they saved Samaria from my power?",
  "35": "\"Which one of all of the gods of those countries has been able to save his land from me? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power?\"",
  "36": "But the people remained silent. They didn't say anything. That's because King Hezekiah had commanded, \"Don't answer him.\"",
  "37": "Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, went to Hezekiah. Eliakim was in charge of the palace. The secretary Shebna went with him. So did Joah, the son of Asaph. Joah kept the records. All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn. They told him what the field commander had said."
