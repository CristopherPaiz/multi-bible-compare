  "3": "So I went to get Jaazaniah. He was the son of Jeremiah. Jeremiah was the son of Habazziniah. I also went to get Jaazaniah's brothers and all of his sons. That included all of the members of the family line of Recab.",
  "4": "I brought them into the Lord's house. I took them into the room of the sons of Hanan. He was the son of Igdaliah. He was also a man of God. His room was next to the room of the officials.

  "5": "Then I got bowls full of wine and some cups. I set them down in front of the men from the family line of Recab. I said to them, \"Drink some wine.\"",
  "6": "But they replied, \"We don't drink wine. That's because Jonadab gave us a command. He was the son of Recab. He was also one of our own people from long ago. He commanded, 'You and your children after you must never drink wine.",
