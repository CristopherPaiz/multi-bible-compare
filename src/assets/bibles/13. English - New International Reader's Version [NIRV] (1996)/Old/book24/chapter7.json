  "6": "Do not treat outsiders or widows badly in this place. Do not take advantage of children whose fathers have died. Do not kill those who are not guilty of doing anything wrong. Do not worship other gods. That will only bring harm to you.",
  "7": "\" ' \"If you obey me, I will let you live in this place. It is the land I gave your people who lived long ago. It was promised to them for ever and ever.",
