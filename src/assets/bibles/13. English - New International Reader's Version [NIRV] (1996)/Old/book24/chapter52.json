  "20": "The bronze was more than anyone could weigh. It included the bronze from the two pillars. It included the bronze from the huge bowl and the 12 bronze bulls that were under it. It also included the stands. King Solomon had made all of those things for the Lord's temple.",

He also took the secretary who was the chief officer in charge of getting the people of the land to serve in the army. And he took 60 of the secretary's men who were still in the city.",
  "26": "The commander Nebuzaradan took all of them away. He brought them to the king of Babylonia at Riblah.",
