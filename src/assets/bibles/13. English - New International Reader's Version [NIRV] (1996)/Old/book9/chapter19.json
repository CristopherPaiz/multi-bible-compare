  "2": "So Jonathan warned him, \"My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be very careful tomorrow morning. Find a place to hide and stay there.",
  "3": "My father and I will come and stand in the field where you are hiding. I'll speak to him about you. Then I'll tell you what I find out.\"",
  "4": "Jonathan told his father Saul some good things about David. He said to him, \"Please don't do anything to harm David. He hasn't done anything to harm you. And what he's done has helped you a lot.",
  "5": "He put his own life in danger when he killed Goliath. The Lord used him to win a great battle for the whole nation of Israel. When you saw it, you were glad. So why would you do anything to harm a man like David? He isn't guilty of doing anything to harm you. Why would you want to kill him without any reason?\"",
  "6": "Saul paid attention to Jonathan. He took an oath and made a promise. He said, \"You can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that David will not be put to death.\"",

  "10": "Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear. But David got away from him just as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David escaped.",
  "11": "Saul sent some men to watch David's house. He told them to kill David the next morning. But David's wife Michal warned him. She said, \"You must run for your life tonight. If you don't, tomorrow you will be killed.\"",
  "12": "So Michal helped David escape through a window. He ran and got away.",
  "13": "Then Michal got a statue of a god. She laid it on David's bed. She covered it with clothes. And she put some goat hair at the place where David's head would have been.",
  "14": "Saul sent the men to capture David. But Michal told them, \"He's sick.\"",
  "15": "Then Saul sent the men back to see David. He told them, \"Bring him up here to me in his bed. Then I'll kill him.\"",
  "16": "But when the men entered, they found nothing but the statue in the bed. Some goat hair was at the place where David's head would have been.",
  "17": "Saul said to Michal, \"Why did you trick me like this? Why did you help my enemy escape?\" Michal told him, \"He said to me, 'Help me get away. If you don't, I'll kill you.' \"",

  "22": "Finally, Saul decided to go to Ramah himself. He went to the large well at Secu. He asked some people, \"Where are Samuel and David?\" \"Over in Naioth at Ramah,\" they said.",
  "23": "So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God even came on him. He walked along and prophesied until he came to Naioth.",
  "24": "There he took off his royal robes. Then he prophesied in front of Samuel. He lay there without his robes on all that day and night. That's why people say, \"Is Saul also one of the prophets?\""
