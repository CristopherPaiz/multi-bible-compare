  "8": "The Lord called out to Samuel for the third time. Samuel got up and went to Eli. He said, \"Here I am. You called out to me.\" Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.",
  "9": "So Eli told Samuel, \"Go and lie down. If someone calls out to you again, say, 'Speak, Lord. I'm listening.' \" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
  "10": "The Lord came and stood there. He called out, just as he had done the other times. He said, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel replied, \"Speak. I'm listening.\"",

  "17": "\"What did the Lord say to you?\" Eli asked. \"Don't hide from me anything he told you. If you do, may God punish you greatly.\"",
  "18": "So Samuel told him everything. He didn't hide anything from him. Then Eli said, \"He is the Lord. Let him do what he thinks is best.\"",
  "19": "As Samuel grew up, the Lord was with him. He made everything Samuel said come true.",
  "20": "So all of the people of Israel recognized that Samuel really was a prophet of the Lord. Everyone from Dan all the way to Beersheba knew it.",
  "21": "The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh. There he made himself known to Samuel through the messages he gave him."
