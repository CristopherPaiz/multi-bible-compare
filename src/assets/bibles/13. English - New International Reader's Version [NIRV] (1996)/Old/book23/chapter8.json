  "3": "Then I went and made love to my wife, who was a prophet. She became pregnant and had a baby boy. The Lord said to me, \"Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.",
  "4": "\"The king of Assyria will carry off the wealth of Damascus. He will also carry away the goods that were taken from Samaria. That will happen before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother.' \"",
  "5": "The Lord continued,",
  "6": "\"I am like the gently flowing stream of Siloam. But the people of Judah have turned their backs on me. They are filled with joy because of the fall of Rezin and the son of Remaliah.",
  "7": "So I am about to bring against these people the king of Assyria and his whole army. The Assyrians will be like the mighty Euphrates River when it is flooding. They will run over everything in their path.",

  "9": "Sound the battle cry, you nations! But you will be torn apart. Listen, all of you lands far away! Prepare for battle! But you will be torn apart. Prepare for battle! But you will be torn apart.",
  "10": "Make your battle plans! But you won't succeed. Give your orders! But they won't be carried out. That's because God is with us.",

  "13": "I am the Lord who rules over all. You must think about me as holy. You must have respect for me. You must fear me.",
  "14": "Then I will be a holy place of safety for you. But for many people in Israel and Judah I will be a stone that causes them to trip. I will be a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem I will be a trap and a snare.",

  "19": "Some will tell you to ask for advice from people who get messages from those who have died. Others will tell you to ask for advice from people who talk to the spirits of the dead. But those people only whisper. Their words are barely heard. So shouldn't you ask for advice from your God? Why should you get advice from dead people to help those who are alive?",
