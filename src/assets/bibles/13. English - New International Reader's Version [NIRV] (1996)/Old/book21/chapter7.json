  "1": "A good name is better than fine perfume. People can learn more from sobbing when someone dies than from being happy when someone is born.",
  "2": "So it's better to go where people are sobbing than to go where people are having a good time. Everyone will die someday. Those who are still living should really think about that.",
  "3": "Sadness is good for the heart. That's why sorrow is better than laughter.",
  "4": "Those who are wise are found where there is sorrow. But foolish people are found where there is pleasure.",
  "5": "Pay attention to a wise man's warning. That's better than listening to the songs of those who are foolish.",
  "6": "A foolish person's laughter is like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot. That doesn't have any meaning either.",
  "7": "When a wise man takes wealth by force, he becomes foolish. It is sinful to take money from people who want special favors.",
  "8": "The end of a matter is better than its beginning. So it's better to be patient than proud.",
  "9": "Don't become angry quickly. Anger lives in the hearts of foolish people.",
  "10": "Don't say, \"Why were things better in the good old days?\" It isn't wise to ask that kind of question.",
  "11": "Wisdom is a good thing. It's like getting a share of the family wealth. It benefits those who live on this earth.",
  "12": "Wisdom provides safety, just as money provides safety. But here's the advantage of wisdom. It guards the lives of those who have it.",
  "13": "Think about what God has done. Who can make straight what he has made crooked?",
  "14": "When times are good, be happy. But when times are bad, here's something to think about. God has made bad times. He has also made good times. So a man can't find out anything about what's ahead for him.",
  "15": "In my meaningless life here's what I've seen. I've seen a godly man dying even though he is godly. And I've seen a sinful man living a long time even though he is sinful.",
  "16": "Don't claim to be better than you are. And don't claim to be wiser than you are. Why destroy yourself?",
  "17": "Don't be too sinful. And don't be foolish. Why die before your time comes?",
  "18": "It's good to hold on to both of those things. Don't let go of either one. A man who has respect for God will avoid going too far in either direction.",
  "19": "Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.",
  "20": "There isn't anyone on earth who does only what is right and never sins.",
  "21": "Don't pay attention to everything people say. If you do, you might hear your servant calling down a curse on you.",
  "22": "Many times you yourself have called down curses on others. Deep down inside, you know that's true.",
  "23": "I used wisdom to put all of those things to the test. I said, \"I've made up my mind to be wise.\" But it was more than I could accomplish.",
  "24": "No matter what else wisdom may be, it's far away and very deep. Who can find it?",
  "25": "So I tried to understand wisdom more completely. I wanted to study it and figure it out. I tried to find out everything I could about it. I tried to understand why it's foolish to be evil. I wanted to see why choosing foolishness is so unwise.",
  "26": "A woman who hunts a man down is more painful than death. Her heart is like a trap. Her hands are like chains. A man who pleases God will try to get away from her. But she will trap a sinner.",
  "27": "\"Look,\" says the Teacher. \"Here's what I've discovered. \"I added one thing to another to find out everything I could about wisdom.",
  "28": "I searched and searched but found very little. I did find one honest man among a thousand. But I didn't find one honest woman among a thousand.",
  "29": "Here's the only other thing I found. God made men honest. But they've made many evil plans.\""
