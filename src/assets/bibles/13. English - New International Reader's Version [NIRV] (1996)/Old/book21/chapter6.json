  "1": "I've seen another evil thing on this earth. And it's a heavy load on men.",
  "2": "God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor. He has everything his heart longs for. But God doesn't let him enjoy those things. Instead, strangers enjoy them. That doesn't have any meaning. It's a very evil thing.",
  "3": "A man might have a hundred children. He might live a long time. But suppose he can't enjoy his wealth. And suppose he isn't buried in the proper way. Then it doesn't matter how long he lives. I'm telling you that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is.",
  "4": "That kind of birth doesn't have any meaning. The baby dies in darkness and leaves this world. And in darkness it is forgotten.",
  "5": "It didn't even see the sun. It didn't know anything at all. But it has more rest than that man does.",
  "6": "And that's true even if he lives for 2,000 years but doesn't get to enjoy his wealth. All people die and go to the grave, don't they?",
  "7": "Man eats up everything he works to get. But he is never satisfied.",
  "8": "What advantage does a wise man have over someone who is foolish? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to act toward others?",
  "9": "Being satisfied with what you have is better than always wanting more. That doesn't have any meaning either. It's like chasing the wind.",
  "10": "God has already planned what now exists. He has already decided what man is. A man can't argue with the One who is stronger than he is.",
  "11": "The more words people use, the less meaning there is. And that doesn't help anyone.",
  "12": "Who knows what's good for a man? He lives for only a few meaningless days. He passes through life like a shadow. Who can tell him what will happen on earth after he is gone?"
