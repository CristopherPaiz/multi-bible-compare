  "3": "There is a time to kill. And there's a time to heal. There is a time to tear down. And there's a time to build up.",
  "4": "There is a time to cry. And there's a time to laugh. There is a time to be sad. And there's a time to dance.",

  "10": "I've seen the heavy load God has put on men.",
  "11": "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also given men a sense of what he's been doing down through the ages. But they can't completely figure out what he's done from the beginning to the end.",

  "15": "Everything that now exists has already been. And what is coming has existed before. God will judge those who treat others badly.",

  "17": "I said to myself, \"God will judge godly and sinful people alike. He has a time for every act. He has a time for everything that is done.\"",
  "18": "I also thought, \"God puts human beings to the test. Then they can see they are just like animals.",
  "19": "What happens to animals happens to people too. Death waits for people and animals alike. People die, just as animals do. All of them have the same breath. People don't have any advantage over animals. Nothing has any meaning.",
