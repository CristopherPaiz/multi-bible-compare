  "3": "He took your pride away. He let you go hungry. Then he gave you manna to eat. You and your parents had never even known anything about manna before. He tested you to teach you that man doesn't live only on bread. He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.",

  "13": "Your herds and flocks increase their numbers. You also get more and more silver and gold. And everything you have multiplies.",
  "14": "Then your hearts will become proud. And you will forget the Lord your God. The Lord brought you out of Egypt. That's the land where you were slaves.",
  "15": "He led you through that huge and terrible desert. It was a dry land. It didn't have any water. It had poisonous snakes and scorpions. The Lord gave you water out of solid rock.",

  "17": "You might say to yourselves, \"Our power and our strong hands have made us rich.\"",
  "18": "But remember the Lord your God. He gives you the ability to produce wealth. That shows he stands by the terms of his covenant. He promised it with an oath to your people long ago. And he's still faithful to his covenant today.",
