  "9": "The Lord your God will make you his holy people. He will set you apart for himself. He took an oath and promised to do that. He promised to do it if you would keep his commands and live exactly as he wants you to live.",
  "10": "All of the nations on earth will see that you belong to the Lord. And they will be afraid of you.",
  "11": "The Lord will give you more than you need. You will have many children. Your livestock will have many little ones. Your crops will do very well. All of that will happen in the land he promised with an oath to your fathers to give you.",

  "14": "Don't turn away from any of the commands I'm giving you today. Don't turn to the right or the left. Don't follow other gods. Don't worship them.",
  "15": "But suppose you don't obey the Lord your God. And you aren't careful to follow all of his commands and rules I'm giving you today. Then he will send curses on you. They'll catch up with you. Here are those curses.",

  "35": "The Lord will send painful boils on your knees and legs. No one will be able to heal them. They will cover you from head to toe.",
  "36": "The Lord will drive you out of the land. And he will drive out the king you place over you. All of you will go to a nation you and your people long ago didn't know anything about. There you will worship other gods. They will be made out of wood and stone.",

  "39": "You will plant vineyards and take care of them. But you won't drink the wine. You won't gather the grapes. Worms will eat them up.",
  "40": "You will have olive trees through your whole country. But you won't use the oil. The olives will drop off the trees.",
  "41": "You will have children. But you won't be able to keep them. They'll be taken away as prisoners.",
  "42": "Large numbers of locusts will eat up the leaves on all of your trees. They will also eat up the crops on your land.",
  "43": "Outsiders who live among you will become your leaders. They will rise higher and higher. But you will sink lower and lower.",
  "44": "They will lend money to you. But you won't be able to lend money to them. They will be the leaders. But you will be the followers.",
  "45": "The Lord your God will send all of those curses on you. They will follow you everywhere. They'll catch up with you. You will be under the Lord's curse until you are destroyed. That's because you didn't obey him. You didn't keep the commands and rules he gave you.",
  "46": "Those curses will remain as miraculous signs and wonders against you and your children after you forever.",
  "47": "You didn't serve the Lord your God with joy and gladness when times were good.",
  "48": "So he will send enemies against you. You will have to serve them. You will be hungry and thirsty. You will be naked and poor. The Lord will put the iron chains of slavery around your necks until he has destroyed you.",
  "49": "The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away. It will come from the ends of the earth. It will dive down on you like an eagle. You won't understand that nation's language.",
  "50": "Its people will look mean. They won't have any respect for old people. They won't show any kindness to young people.",
  "51": "They will eat up the young animals among your livestock. They'll eat up the crops on your land. They'll destroy you. They won't leave you any grain, olive oil or fresh wine. They won't leave you any calves or lambs. They'll destroy you.",
  "52": "They'll surround all of the cities through your whole land. They'll get ready to attack them. They'll do those things until the high, strong walls you trust in fall down. That's what will happen to the cities in the land the Lord your God is giving you.",
  "53": "Your enemies will surround you and get ready to attack you. They will make you suffer greatly. So you will eat your own children. You will eat the dead bodies of the sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you.",
  "54": "There may be a gentle and caring man among you. But he will treat his own brother badly. He'll be just as mean to the wife he loves and to any of his children who are still alive.",
  "55": "He won't give to a single one of them any part of the dead bodies of his children that he's eating. It will be all he has left to eat. That's how much your enemies will make you suffer when they surround all of your cities to attack them.",
  "56": "There may be a gentle and caring woman among you. She wouldn't even touch the ground with her feet without first putting her sandals on. But she will not share anything with the husband she loves. She won't share with her own children either.",
  "57": "She will eat what comes out of her body after she has a baby. Then she'll even eat her baby. She won't share it with anyone in her family. She'll plan to eat it in secret. There won't be anything else for her to eat because the city she lives in will be surrounded. That's an example of how much your enemies will make you suffer when they are getting ready to attack your cities.",
  "58": "Be careful to follow all of the words of this law. They are written in this scroll. Have respect for the glorious and wonderful name of the Lord your God. If you don't,",
  "59": "he will send terrible plagues on you and your children after you. He'll send horrible and lasting troubles. He'll make you very sick for a long time.",
  "60": "He'll bring on you all of the sicknesses you were afraid of getting when you were in Egypt. You won't be able to get rid of them.",
  "61": "The Lord will also bring on you all of the other kinds of sickness and trouble I haven't written down in this Scroll of the Law. You will be destroyed.",
  "62": "At one time you were as many as the stars in the sky. But there will only be a few of you left. That's because you didn't obey the Lord your God.",
  "63": "It pleased the Lord to give you success and to increase your numbers. But it will please him just as much to wipe you out and destroy you. You will be removed from the land you are entering to take as your own.",
  "64": "Then the Lord will scatter you among all of the nations. He'll spread you around from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship statues of gods that are made out of wood and stone. You and your people long ago hadn't known anything about those gods.",
  "65": "Among those nations you won't find any peace. There won't be any place where you can settle down and rest your feet. There the Lord will give you minds that are filled with worry. He'll give you eyes that are worn out from sobbing. Your hearts won't have any hope.",
  "66": "Your lives will always be in danger. You will be filled with fear night and day. You will never be sure you are safe.",
  "67": "In the morning you will say, \"We wish it were evening!\" In the evening you will say, \"We wish it were morning!\" Your hearts will be filled with fear. The things you see will terrify you.",
  "68": "The Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships. He'll send you on a journey I said you should never have to make again. You will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves in Egypt. But no one will buy you."
