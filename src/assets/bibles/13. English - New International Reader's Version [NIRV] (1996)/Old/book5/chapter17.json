  "14": "You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. You will take it as your own. You will settle down in it. When you do, you will say, \"Let's appoint a king over us, just like all of the nations around us.\"",
  "15": "When that happens, make sure you appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses. He must be from among your own people. Don't appoint over you someone from another country. Don't choose anyone who isn't from one of the tribes of Israel.",
