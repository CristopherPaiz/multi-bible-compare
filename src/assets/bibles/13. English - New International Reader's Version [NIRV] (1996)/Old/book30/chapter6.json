  "11": "The Lord has already given an order. He will smash large houses to pieces. He will crush small houses to bits.",
  "12": "Horses don't run on rocky ground. People don't plow there with oxen. But you have turned fair treatment into poison. You have turned the fruit of right living into bitterness.",
  "13": "You are happy because you captured the town of Lo Debar. You say, \"We were strong enough to take Karnaim too.\"",
  "14": "But the Lord God rules over all. He announces, \"People of Israel, I will stir up a nation against you. They will crush you from Lebo Hamath all the way down to the Arabah Valley.\""
