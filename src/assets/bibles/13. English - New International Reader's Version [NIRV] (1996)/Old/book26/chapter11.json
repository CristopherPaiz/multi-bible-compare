  "4": "So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.\"",
  "5": "Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me. He told me to tell them, \"The Lord says, 'People of Israel, that is what you are saying. But I know what you are thinking.",

  "12": "Then you will know that I am the Lord. You have not followed my rules. You have not kept my laws. Instead, you have lived by the standards of the nations that are around you.' \"",
  "13": "Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, died as I was prophesying. Then I fell with my face toward the ground. I cried out in a loud voice. I said, \"Lord and King, will you destroy all of the Israelites who are still left alive?\"",
  "14": "A message came to me from the Lord. He said,",
  "15": "\"Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have spoken about your relatives. They have also spoken about all of the other people of Israel. They have said, 'Stay far away from the Lord. This land was given to us. And it belongs to us.'",
  "16": "\"So tell them, 'The Lord and King says, \"I sent some of my people far away among the nations. I scattered them among the countries. But for a little while I have been their temple in the countries where they have gone.\" '",
  "17": "\"Tell them, 'The Lord and King says, \"I will gather you from the nations. I will bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered. I will give you back the land of Israel.\" '",
  "18": "\"They will return to it. They will remove all of its statues of evil gods. I hate those gods.",
  "19": "I will give my people hearts that are completely committed to me. I will give them a new spirit that is faithful to me. I will remove their stubborn hearts from them. And I will give them hearts that obey me.",
