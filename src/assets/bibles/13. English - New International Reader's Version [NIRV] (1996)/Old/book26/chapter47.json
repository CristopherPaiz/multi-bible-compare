  "1": "The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple. I saw water flowing east from under a temple gateway. The temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple. It was flowing south of the altar.",
  "2": "Then he brought me out through the north gate of the outer courtyard. He led me around the outside to the outer gate that faced east. The water was flowing from the south side of the east gate.",
  "3": "Then the man went toward the east. He had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 1,750 feet. He led me through water that was up to my ankles.",
  "4": "Then he measured off another 1,750 feet. He led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another 1,750 feet. He led me through water that was up to my waist.",
  "5": "Then he measured off another 1,750 feet. But now it was a river that I could not go across. The water had risen so high that it was deep enough to swim in.",
  "6": "He asked me, \"Son of man, do you see this?\" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.",
  "7": "When I arrived there, I saw a large number of trees. They were on both sides of the river.",
  "8": "The man said to me, \"This water flows toward the eastern territory. It goes down into the Arabah Valley. There it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into it, the water there becomes fresh.",
  "9": "Large numbers of creatures will live where the river flows. It will have huge numbers of fish. This water flows there and makes the salt water fresh. So where the river flows everything will live.",
  "10": "\"People will stand along the shore to fish. From En Gedi all the way to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading fishnets. The Dead Sea will have many kinds of fish. They will be like the fish in the Mediterranean Sea.",
  "11": "\"But none of the swamps will have fresh water in them. They will stay salty.",
  "12": "\"Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not dry up. The trees will always have fruit on them. Every month they will bear fruit. The water from the temple will flow to them. Their fruit will be used for food. And their leaves will be used for healing.\"",
  "13": "The Lord and King says, \"People of Israel, here are the borders you will have after you divide up the land. Each of the 12 tribes will receive a share. But the family of Joseph will have two shares.",
  "14": "Divide the land into equal parts. Long ago I raised my hand and took an oath. I promised to give the land to your people. So all of it will belong to you.",
  "15": "\"Here are the borders of the land. \"On the north side the border will start at the Mediterranean Sea. It will go by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath. Then it will continue on to Zedad,",
  "16": "Berothah and Sibraim. Sibraim is between Damascus and Hamath. The border will reach all the way to Hazer Hatticon. It is right next to Hauran.",
  "17": "The border will go from the sea to Hazar Enan. It will run north of Damascus and south of Hamath. That will be the north border.",
  "18": "\"On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus. It will continue along the Jordan River between Gilead and the land of Israel. It will reach to the Dead Sea and all the way to Tamar. That will be the east border.",
  "19": "\"On the south side the border will start at Tamar. It will reach all the way to the waters of Meribah Kadesh. Then it will run along the Wadi of Egypt. It will end at the Mediterranean Sea. That will be the south border.",
  "20": "\"On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the border. It will go to a point across from Lebo Hamath. That will be the west border.",
  "21": "\"You must divide up this land among yourselves. Do it based on the number of men in your tribes.",
  "22": "Each of the tribes must receive a share of the land. \"You must also give some land to the outsiders who have settled among you and who have children. Treat them as if they had been born in Israel. Let them have some land among your tribes.",
  "23": "Outsiders can settle in any tribe. There you must give them their share,\" announces the Lord and King."
