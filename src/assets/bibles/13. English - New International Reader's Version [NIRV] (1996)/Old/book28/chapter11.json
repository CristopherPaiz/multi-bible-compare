  "10": "I will roar like a lion against my enemies. You will follow me. When I roar, my children will come home trembling with fear. You will return from the west.",
  "11": "You will come trembling like birds from Egypt. You will return like doves from Assyria. I will settle you again in your homes,\" announces the Lord.",
