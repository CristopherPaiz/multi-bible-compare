  "1": "The Lord left some nations in the land. He left them there in order to put the people of Israel to the test. He did it for all those who hadn't lived through any of the wars in Canaan.",
  "2": "He wanted to teach the men in Israel who had never been in battle before. He wanted them to learn how to fight.",
  "3": "So he left the five rulers of the Philistines. He left the people of Canaan and the people of Sidon. He left the Hivites who were living in the Lebanon mountains. They lived in the area that was between Mount Baal Hermon and Lebo Hamath.",
  "4": "The Lord left those nations where they were in order to put Israel to the test. He wanted to see whether they would obey his commands. He had given those commands through Moses to their people of long ago.",
  "5": "So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.",
  "6": "They got married to the daughters of those people. They gave their own daughters to the sons of those people. And they served the gods of those people.",
  "7": "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God. They served the gods that were named after Baal. They also served the goddesses that were named after Asherah.",
  "8": "So the Lord's anger burned against Israel. He gave them over to the power of Cushan-Rishathaim. He was the king of Aram Naharaim. For eight years Israel was under his rule.",
  "9": "They cried out to the Lord. Then he gave them a man to save them. His name was Othniel, the son of Kenaz. He was Caleb's younger brother.",
  "10": "The Spirit of the Lord came on Othniel. So he became Israel's leader. He went to war. The Lord handed Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram, over to him. Othniel overpowered him.",
  "11": "So the land was at peace for 40 years. Then Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.",
  "12": "Once again the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Because they did that, the Lord gave Eglon power over Israel. Eglon was the king of Moab.",
  "13": "He got the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him. All of them came and attacked Israel. They took over Jericho. Jericho was also known as The City of Palm Trees.",
  "14": "For 18 years the people of Israel were under the rule of Eglon, the king of Moab.",
  "15": "Again the people of Israel cried out to the Lord. Then he gave them a man to save them. His name was Ehud, the son of Gera. Ehud was left-handed. He was from the tribe of Benjamin. The people of Israel sent Ehud to Eglon, the king of Moab. They sent him to give the king what he required them to bring him.",
  "16": "Ehud had made a sword that had two edges. It was about a foot and a half long. He tied it to his right leg under his clothes.",
  "17": "Eglon, the king of Moab, was a very fat man. Ehud gave him the gift he had brought.",
  "18": "After that, he sent away those who had carried it.",
  "19": "At the place where some statues of gods stood near Gilgal, Ehud turned back. He said, \"King Eglon, I have a secret message for you.\" The king said, \"I want everyone to be quiet.\" And all of his attendants left him.",
  "20": "Then Ehud approached him. King Eglon was sitting alone in the upstairs room of his summer palace. Ehud said, \"I have a message from God for you.\" So the king got up from his seat.",
  "21": "Then Ehud reached out his left hand. He pulled out the sword that was tied to his right leg. He stuck it into the king's stomach.",
  "22": "Even the handle sank in after the blade. The blade came right out the king's back. Ehud didn't pull the sword out. And the fat closed over it.",
  "23": "Ehud went out to the porch. He shut the doors of the upstairs room behind him. Then he locked them.",
  "24": "After he had gone, the servants came. They found the doors of the upstairs room locked. They said, \"Eglon must be going to the toilet in the inside room of the house.\"",
  "25": "They waited for a long time. They waited so long they became worried. But the king still didn't open the doors of the room. So they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their king. He had fallen to the floor. He was dead.",
  "26": "While Eglon's servants had been waiting, Ehud had gotten away. He passed by the statues of gods and escaped to Seirah.",
  "27": "There in the hill country of Ephraim he blew a trumpet. Then he led the people of Israel down from the hills.",
  "28": "\"Follow me,\" Ehud ordered. \"The Lord has handed your enemy Moab over to you.\" So they followed him down. They took over the only places where people could go across the Jordan River to get to Moab. They didn't let anyone go across.",
  "29": "At that time they struck down about 10,000 men of Moab. All of those men were strong and powerful. But not even one escaped.",
  "30": "That day Moab was brought under the rule of Israel. So the land was at peace for 80 years.",
  "31": "After Ehud, Shamgar became the next leader. He was the son of Anath. He struck down 600 Philistines with a large, pointed stick that was used to drive oxen. He saved Israel too."
