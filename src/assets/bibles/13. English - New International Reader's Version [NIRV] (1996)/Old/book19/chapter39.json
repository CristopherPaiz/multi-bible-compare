  "1": "For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David. I said, \"I will be careful about how I live. I will not sin by what I say. I will keep my mouth closed when sinful people are near me.\"",
  "2": "I was silent and kept quiet. I didn't even say anything good. But the pain inside me grew worse.",
  "3": "My heart was deeply troubled. As I thought about what was happening to me, I became even more troubled. Then I spoke out.",
  "4": "I said, \"Lord, show me when my life will end. Show me how many days I have left. Tell me how short my life will be.",
  "5": "You have given me only a few days to live. My whole life doesn't seem like anything to you. No man's life lasts any longer than a breath. Selah",
  "6": "People are only shadows as they go here and there. They rush around, but it doesn't mean anything. They pile up wealth, but they don't know who will get it.",
  "7": "\"Lord, what can I look forward to now? You are the only hope I have.",
  "8": "Save me from all the wrong things I've done. Don't let foolish people make fun of me.",

  "11": "You correct and punish people for their sin. Just as a moth eats cloth, you destroy their wealth. No one's life lasts any longer than a breath. Selah",
  "12": "\"Lord, hear my prayer. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my sobbing. I'm like a guest in your home. I'm only a visitor, like all of my family who lived before me.",
  "13": "Leave me alone. Let me be full of joy again before I die.\""
