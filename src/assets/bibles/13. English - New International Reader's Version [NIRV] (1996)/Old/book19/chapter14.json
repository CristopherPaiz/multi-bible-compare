  "5": "Just look at them! They are filled with terror because God is among those who do right.",
  "6": "You who do evil make it hard for poor people to do what they plan to do. But the Lord is their place of safety.",
  "7": "How I pray that the One who saves Israel will come out of Zion! Then the Lord will bless his people with great success again. So let the people of Jacob be filled with joy! Let Israel be glad!"
