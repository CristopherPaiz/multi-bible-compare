  "1": "A psalm of David. Lord, I call out to you. Come quickly to help me. Listen to me when I call out to you.",
  "2": "May my prayer come to you like the sweet smell of incense. When I lift up my hands in prayer, may it be like the evening sacrifice.",
  "3": "Lord, guard my mouth. Keep watch over the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Don't let my heart be drawn to what is evil. Don't let me join men who do evil. They don't do what is right. Don't let me join them and eat their fancy food.",
  "5": "If a person who does what is right were to strike me, it would be an act of kindness. If that person were to correct me, it would be like pouring olive oil on my head. I wouldn't say no to it. But I always pray against the things that sinful people do.",
  "6": "When their rulers are thrown down from the rocky cliffs, those evil people will realize that my words were true.",
  "7": "They will say, \"As clumps of dirt are left from plowing up the ground, so our bones will be scattered near an open grave.\"",
  "8": "But Lord and King, I keep looking to you. I go to you for safety. Don't let me die.",
  "9": "Keep me from the traps of those who do evil. Save me from the traps they have set for me.",
  "10": "Let evil people fall into their own nets. But let me go safely on my way."
