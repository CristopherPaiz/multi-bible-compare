  "1": "BOOK I Blessed is the one who obeys the law of the Lord. He doesn't follow the advice of evil people. He doesn't make a habit of doing what sinners do. He doesn't join those who make fun of the Lord and his law.",
  "2": "Instead, he takes delight in the law of the Lord. He thinks about his law day and night.",
  "3": "He is like a tree that is planted near a stream of water. It always bears its fruit at the right time. Its leaves don't dry up. Everything godly people do turns out well.",
  "4": "Sinful people are not like that at all. They are like straw that the wind blows away.",
  "5": "When the Lord judges them, their life will come to an end. Sinners won't have any place among those who are godly.",
  "6": "The Lord watches over the lives of those who are godly. But the lives of sinful people will lead to their death."
