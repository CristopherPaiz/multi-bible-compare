  "1": "For the director of music. A psalm of David. Lord, you have seen what is in my heart. You know all about me.",
  "2": "You know when I sit down and when I get up. You know what I'm thinking even though you are far away.",
  "3": "You know when I go out to work and when I come back home. You know exactly how I live.",
  "4": "Lord, even before I speak a word, you know all about it.",
  "5": "You are all around me. You are behind me and in front of me. You hold me in your power.",
  "6": "I'm amazed at how well you know me. It's more than I can understand.",
  "7": "How can I get away from your Spirit? Where can I go to escape from you?",

  "16": "your eyes saw my body even before it was formed. You planned how many days I would live. You wrote down the number of them in your book before I had lived through even one of them.",
  "17": "God, your thoughts about me are priceless. No one can possibly add them all up.",
  "18": "If I could count them, they would be more than the grains of sand. If I were to fall asleep counting and then wake up, you would still be there with me.",
  "19": "God, I wish you would kill the people who are evil! I wish those murderers would get away from me!",
  "20": "They are your enemies. They misuse your name. They misuse it for their own evil purposes.",
  "21": "Lord, I really hate those who hate you! I really hate those who rise up against you!",
  "22": "I have nothing but hatred for them. I consider them to be my enemies.",
  "23": "God, see what is in my heart. Know what is there. Put me to the test. Know what I'm thinking.",
  "24": "See if there's anything in my life you don't like. Help me live in the way that is always right."
