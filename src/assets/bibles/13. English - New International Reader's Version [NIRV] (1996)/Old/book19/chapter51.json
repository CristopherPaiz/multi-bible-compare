  "1": "For the director of music. A psalm of David when the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba. God, show me your favor in keeping with your faithful love. Because your love is so tender and kind, wipe out my lawless acts.",
  "2": "Wash away all of the evil things I've done. Make me pure from my sin.",
  "3": "I know the lawless acts I've committed. I can't forget my sin.",
  "4": "You are the one I've really sinned against. I've done what is evil in your sight. So you are right when you sentence me. You are fair when you judge me.",
  "5": "I know I've been a sinner ever since I was born. I've been a sinner ever since my mother became pregnant with me.",
  "6": "I know that you want truth to be in my heart. You teach me wisdom deep down inside me.",
  "7": "Make me pure by sprinkling me with hyssop plant. Then I will be clean. Wash me. Then I will be whiter than snow.",
  "8": "Let me hear you say, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" That will bring me joy and gladness. Let the body you have broken be glad.",
  "9": "Take away all of my sins. Wipe away all of the evil things I've done.",
  "10": "God, create a pure heart in me. Give me a new spirit that is faithful to you.",
  "11": "Don't send me away from you. Don't take your Holy Spirit away from me.",
  "12": "Give me back the joy that comes from being saved by you. Give me a spirit that obeys you. That will keep me going.",
  "13": "Then I will teach your ways to those who commit lawless acts. And sinners will turn back to you.",
  "14": "You are the God who saves me. I have committed murder. Take away my guilt. Then my tongue will sing about how right you are no matter what you do.",
  "15": "Lord, open my lips so that I can speak. Then my mouth will praise you.",
  "16": "You don't take delight in sacrifice. If you did, I would bring it. You don't take pleasure in burnt offerings.",
  "17": "The greatest sacrifice you want is a broken spirit. God, you will gladly accept a heart that is broken because of sadness over sin.",
  "18": "May you be pleased to give Zion success. Build up the walls of Jerusalem.",
  "19": "Then holy sacrifices will be offered in the right way. Whole burnt offerings will bring delight to you. And bulls will be offered on your altar."
