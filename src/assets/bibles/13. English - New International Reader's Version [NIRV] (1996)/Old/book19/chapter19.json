  "1": "For the director of music. A psalm of David. The heavens tell about the glory of God. The skies show that his hands created them.",
  "2": "Day after day they speak about it. Night after night they make it known.",
  "3": "But they don't speak or use words. No sound is heard from them.",
  "4": "At the same time, their voice goes out into the whole earth. Their words go out from one end of the world to the other. God has set up a tent in the heavens for the sun.",
  "5": "The sun is like a groom coming out of the room where he spent his wedding night. The sun is like a great runner who takes delight in running a race.",
  "6": "It rises at one end of the heavens. Then it moves across to the other end. Nothing can hide from its heat.",
  "7": "The law of the Lord is perfect. It gives us new strength. The laws of the Lord can be trusted. They make childish people wise.",
  "8": "The rules of the Lord are right. They give joy to our hearts. The commands of the Lord shine brightly. They give light to our minds.",
  "9": "The law that brings respect for the Lord is pure. It lasts forever. The directions the Lord gives are true. All of them are completely right.",
  "10": "They are more priceless than gold. They have greater value than huge amounts of pure gold. They are sweeter than honey that is taken from the honeycomb.",
  "11": "I am warned by them. When I obey them, I am greatly rewarded.",
  "12": "Can I know my mistakes? Forgive my hidden faults.",
  "13": "Keep me also from the sins I want to commit. May they not be my master. Then I will be without blame. I will not be guilty of any great sin against your law.",
  "14": "Lord, may the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your eyes. You are my Rock and my Redeemer."
