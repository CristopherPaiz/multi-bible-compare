  "1": "A psalm of David. A song for committing the completed temple to God. Lord, I will give you honor. You brought me out of deep trouble. You didn't give my enemies the joy of seeing me die.",
  "2": "Lord my God, I called out to you for help. And you healed me.",
  "3": "Lord, you brought me up from the edge of the grave. You kept me from going down into the pit.",
  "4": "Sing to the Lord, you who are faithful to him. Praise him, because his name is holy.",
  "5": "His anger lasts for only a moment. But his favor lasts for a person's whole life. Sobbing can remain through the night. But joy comes in the morning.",
  "6": "When I felt safe, I said, \"I will always be secure.\"",
  "7": "Lord, when you showed me your favor, you made my mountain stand firm. But when you turned your face away from me, I was terrified.",
  "8": "Lord, I called out to you. I cried to you for your favor.",
  "9": "I said, \"What good will come if I die? What good will come if I go down into the grave? Can the dust of my dead body praise you? Can it tell how faithful you are?",
  "10": "Lord, hear me. Show me your favor. Lord, help me.\"",
  "11": "You turned my loud crying into dancing. You removed my black clothes and dressed me with joy.",
  "12": "So my heart will sing to you. I can't keep silent. Lord, my God, I will give you thanks forever."
