  "1": "A psalm of David. The Lord gives me light and saves me. Why should I fear anyone? The Lord is my place of safety. Why should I be afraid?",
  "2": "My enemies are evil. They will trip and fall when they attack me and try to eat me alive.",
  "3": "Even if an army attacks me, my heart will not be afraid. Even if war breaks out against me, I will still trust in God.",
  "4": "I'm asking the Lord for only one thing. Here is what I want. I want to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. I want to look at the beauty of the Lord. I want to worship him in his temple.",
  "5": "When I'm in trouble, he will keep me safe in his house. He will hide me in the safety of his holy tent. He will put me on a rock that is very high.",
  "6": "Then I will win the battle over my enemies who are all around me. At his holy tent I will offer my sacrifice with shouts of joy. I will sing and make music to the Lord.",
  "7": "Lord, hear my voice when I call out to you. Show me your favor and answer me.",
  "8": "My heart says, \"Look to him!\" Lord, I will look to you.",
  "9": "Don't turn your face away from me. Don't turn me away because you are angry. You have helped me. God my Savior, don't say no to me. Don't desert me.",
  "10": "My father and mother may desert me, but the Lord will accept me.",
  "11": "Lord, teach me your ways. Lead me along a straight path. There are many people who beat me down.",
  "12": "My enemies want to harm me. So don't turn me over to them. Witnesses who tell lies are rising up against me. They are trying to destroy me.",
  "13": "Here is something I am still sure of. I will see the Lord's goodness while I'm still alive.",
  "14": "Wait for the Lord. Be strong and don't lose hope. Wait for the Lord."
