  "1": "A song for those who go up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord. A psalm of Solomon. If the Lord doesn't build a house, the work of its builders is useless. If the Lord doesn't watch over a city, it's useless for those on guard duty to stand watch over it.",
  "2": "It's useless for you to work from early morning until late at night just to get food to eat. God provides for those he loves even while they sleep.",
  "3": "Children are a gift from the Lord. They are a reward from him.",
  "4": "Children who are born to people when they are young are like arrows in the hands of a soldier.",
  "5": "Blessed are those who have many children. They won't be put to shame when they go up against their enemies in court."
