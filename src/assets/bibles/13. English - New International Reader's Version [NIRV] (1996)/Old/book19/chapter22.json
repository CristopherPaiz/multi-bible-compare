  "1": "For the director of music. A psalm of David to the tune of \"The Doe of the Morning.\" My God, my God, why have you deserted me? Why do you seem to be so far away when I need you to save me? Why do you seem to be so far away that you can't hear my groans?",
  "2": "My God, I cry out in the daytime. But you don't answer. I cry out at night. I can't keep quiet.",
  "3": "But you rule from your throne as the Holy One. You are the God Israel praises.",
  "4": "Our people of long ago put their trust in you. They trusted in you, and you saved them.",
  "5": "They cried out to you and were saved. They trusted in you, and you didn't let them down.",
  "6": "People treat me like a worm and not a man. They hate me and look down on me.",
  "7": "All those who see me laugh at me. They shout at me and make fun of me. They shake their heads at me.",
  "8": "They say, \"He trusts in the Lord. Let the Lord help him. If the Lord is pleased with him, let him save him.\"",
  "9": "But you brought me out of my mother's body. You made me trust in you even when I was at my mother's breast.",
  "10": "From the time I was born, you took good care of me. Ever since I came out of my mother's body, you have been my God.",
  "11": "Don't be far away from me. Trouble is near, and there is no one to help me.",
  "12": "Many enemies are all around me. They are like strong bulls from the land of Bashan.",
  "13": "They are like roaring lions that tear to pieces what they kill. They open their mouths wide to attack me.",
  "14": "My strength is like water that is poured out on the ground. I feel as if my bones aren't connected. My heart has turned to wax. It has melted away inside me.",
  "15": "My strength is dried up like a piece of broken pottery. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You bring me down to the edge of the grave.",
  "16": "A group of sinful people has closed in on me. They are all around me like a pack of dogs. They have pierced my hands and my feet.",
  "17": "I can see all of my bones right through my skin. People stare at me. They laugh when I suffer.",
  "18": "They divide up my clothes among them. They cast lots for what I am wearing.",
  "19": "Lord, don't be so far away. You give me strength. Come quickly to help me.",
  "20": "Save me from the sword. Save the only life I have. Save me from the power of those dogs.",
  "21": "Save me from the mouths of those lions. Save me from the horns of those wild oxen.",
  "22": "I will announce your name to my brothers and sisters. I will praise you among those who worship you.",
  "23": "You who have respect for the Lord, praise him! All you people of Jacob, honor him! All you people of Israel, worship him!",
  "24": "He has not forgotten the one who is hurting. He has not turned away from his suffering. He has not turned his face away from him. He has listened to his cry for help.",
  "25": "Because of what you have done, I will praise you in the whole community of those who worship you. In front of those who respect you, I will keep my promises.",
  "26": "Those who are poor will eat and be satisfied. Those who look to the Lord will praise him. May their hearts be filled with new hope!",
  "27": "People from one end of the earth to the other will remember and turn to the Lord. The people of all the nations will bow down before him.",
  "28": "The Lord is King. He rules over the nations.",
  "29": "All the rich people of the earth will worship God and take part in his feasts. All those who go down to the edge of the grave will fall on their knees in front of him. I'm talking about those who can hardly keep themselves alive.",
  "30": "Those who are not yet born will serve him. Those who are born later will be told about the Lord.",
  "31": "And they will tell people who have not yet been born that he has done what is right."
