  "1": "\"But now those who are younger than I am make fun of me. I wouldn't put even their parents with my sheep dogs!",
  "2": "Their strong hands couldn't give me any help. That's because their strength was gone.",
  "3": "They were weak because they were needy and hungry. They wandered through dry and empty deserts at night.",
  "4": "Among the bushes they gathered salty plants. They ate the roots of desert trees.",
  "5": "They were driven away from society. They were shouted at as if they were robbers.",
  "6": "They were forced to live in dry stream beds. They had to stay among rocks and in holes in the ground.",
  "7": "Like donkeys they cried out among the bushes. There they crowded together and hid.",
  "8": "They were so foolish that no one respected them. They were driven out of the land.",
  "9": "\"Now their children laugh at me. They make fun of me with their songs.",
  "10": "They hate me. They stay away from me. They even dare to spit in my face.",
  "11": "God has made my body weak. It's like a tent that has fallen down. So those children do what they want to in front of me.",
  "12": "Many people attack me on my right side. They lay traps for my feet. They come at me from every direction.",
  "13": "They tear up the road I walk on. They succeed in destroying me. They do it without any help.",
  "14": "They attack me like troops smashing through a wall. Among the destroyed buildings they come rolling in.",
  "15": "Terrors sweep over me. My honor is driven away as if by the wind. My safety vanishes like a cloud.",
  "16": "\"Now my life is slipping away. Days of suffering grab hold of me.",
  "17": "At night my bones hurt. My gnawing pains never stop.",
  "18": "God's great power becomes like clothes to me. He chokes me like the neck of my shirt.",
  "19": "He throws me down into the mud. I'm nothing but dust and ashes.",
  "20": "\"God, I cry out to you. But you don't answer me. I stand up. But all you do is look at me.",
  "21": "You do mean things to me. Your mighty hand attacks me.",
  "22": "You pick me up and blow me away with the wind. You toss me around in the storm.",
  "23": "I know that you will bring me down to death. That's what you have appointed for everyone.",
  "24": "\"No one would crush people when they cry out for help in their trouble.",
  "25": "Haven't I sobbed over those who are in trouble? Haven't I felt sorry for poor people?",
  "26": "I hoped good things would happen, but something evil came. I looked for light, but all I saw was darkness.",
  "27": "My insides are always churning. Nothing but days of suffering are ahead of me.",
  "28": "My skin has become dark, but the sun didn't do it. I stand up in the community and cry out for help.",
  "29": "I've become a brother to wild dogs. Owls are my companions.",
  "30": "My skin grows black and peels. My body burns with fever.",
  "31": "My harp is tuned to sadness. My flute makes a sound like sobbing."
