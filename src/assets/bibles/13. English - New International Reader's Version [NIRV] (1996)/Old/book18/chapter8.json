  "2": "\"Job, how long will you talk like that? Your words don't have any meaning.",
  "3": "Does God ever treat people unfairly? Does the Mighty One make what is wrong appear to be right?",
  "4": "Your children sinned against him. So he punished them for their sin.",
  "5": "But look to God. Make your appeal to the Mighty One.",
  "6": "Be pure and honest. And he will rise up and help you now. He'll return you to the place where you belong.",
  "7": "In the past, things went well with you. But in days to come, things will get even better.",
  "8": "\"Find out what your people who lived long ago taught. Discover what those who lived before them learned.",

  "18": "But when a plant is pulled up from its spot, that place says, 'I never saw you.'",
  "19": "The life of that plant is sure to dry up. But from the same soil other plants will grow.",
  "20": "\"I'm sure God doesn't turn his back on anyone who is honest. And he doesn't help those who do what is evil.",
  "21": "He will fill your mouth with laughter. Shouts of joy will come from your lips.",
  "22": "Your enemies will put on shame as if it were clothes. The tents of sinful people will be gone.\""
