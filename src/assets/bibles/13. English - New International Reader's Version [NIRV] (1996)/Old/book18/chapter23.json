  "2": "\"Even today my problems are more than I can handle. In spite of my groans, God's hand is heavy on me.",
  "3": "I wish I knew where I could find him! I wish I could go to the place where he lives!",
  "4": "I would state my case to him. I'd give him all of my arguments.",
  "5": "I'd find out what his answers would be. I'd think about what he would say.",

  "14": "He carries out his plans against me. And he still has many other plans just like them.",
  "15": "That's why I'm so terrified. When I think about all of this, I'm afraid of him.",
  "16": "God has made my heart weak. The Mighty One has filled me with terror.",
  "17": "But even the darkness of death won't make me silent. When the darkness of the grave covers my face, I won't be quiet."
