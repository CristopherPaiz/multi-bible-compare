  "1": "On another day angels came to the Lord. Satan also came to him along with them.",
  "2": "The Lord said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" Satan answered, \"From traveling all around the earth. I've been going from one end of it to the other.\"",
  "3": "Then the Lord said to Satan, \"Have you thought about my servant Job? There isn't anyone on earth like him. He is honest. He does what is right. He has respect for me and avoids evil. You tried to turn me against him. You wanted me to destroy him without any reason. But he still continues to be faithful.\"",
  "4": "Satan replied, \"A man will give everything he has to save himself. So Job is willing to give up the lives of his family to save his own life.",
  "5": "\"But reach out your hand and strike his flesh and bones. Then I'm sure he will speak evil things against you. In fact, he'll do it right in front of you.\"",

So they started out from their homes. They had agreed to meet together. They wanted to go and show their concern for Job. They wanted to comfort him.",
  "12": "When they got closer to where he lived, they could see him. But they could hardly recognize him. They began to sob out loud. They tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.",
  "13": "Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him. That's because they saw how much he was suffering."
