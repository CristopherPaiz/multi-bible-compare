  "1": "Job replied,",
  "2": "\"I'm sure that what you have said is true. But how can human beings be right with God?",
  "3": "They might wish to argue with him. But they couldn't answer him even once in a thousand times.",
  "4": "His wisdom is deep. His power is great. No one opposes him and comes away unharmed.",
  "5": "He moves mountains, and they don't even know it. When he is angry, he turns them upside down.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth loose from its place. He makes its pillars tremble.",
  "7": "When he tells the sun not to shine, it doesn't. He turns off the light of the stars.",
  "8": "He's the only one who can spread the heavens out. He alone can walk on the waves of the ocean.",
  "9": "He made the Big Dipper and Orion. He created the Pleiades and the southern stars.",
  "10": "He does wonderful things that can't be understood. He does miracles that can't even be counted.",
  "11": "When he passes by me, I can't see him. When he goes past me, I can't recognize him.",
  "12": "If he takes something, who can stop him? Who would dare to ask him, 'What are you doing?'",
  "13": "God doesn't hold back his anger. Even the helpers of the sea monster Rahab bowed in fear at his feet.",
  "14": "\"So how can I disagree with God? How can I possibly argue with him?",
  "15": "Even if I hadn't done anything wrong, I couldn't answer him. I could only beg my Judge to have mercy on me.",
  "16": "Suppose I called out to him and he answered. I don't believe he'd listen to me.",
  "17": "He would send a storm to crush me. He'd increase my wounds without any reason.",
  "18": "He wouldn't let me catch my breath. He'd make my life very bitter.",
  "19": "If it's a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it's a matter of being fair, who would dare to bring charges against him?",
  "20": "Even if I hadn't sinned, what I said would prove me guilty. Even if I were honest, my words would show that I'm wrong.",
  "21": "\"Even though I'm honest, I'm not concerned about myself. I hate my own life.",
  "22": "It all amounts to the same thing. That's why I say, 'God destroys honest people and sinful people alike.'",
  "23": "Suppose a plague brings sudden death. Then he laughs when those who haven't sinned lose hope.",
  "24": "Suppose a nation falls into the power of sinful people. Then God makes its judges blind to the truth. If he isn't the one doing it, who is?",
  "25": "\"God, my days race by like a runner. They fly away without seeing any joy.",
  "26": "They speed along like papyrus boats. They are like eagles swooping down on their food.",
  "27": "Suppose I say, 'I'll forget about all of my problems. I'll change my frown into a smile.'",
  "28": "Then I'd still be afraid I'd go on suffering. That's because I know you would say I had done something wrong.",
  "29": "In fact, you have already said I'm guilty. So why should I struggle without any reason?",
  "30": "Suppose I clean myself with soap. Suppose I wash my hands with cleanser.",
  "31": "Even then you would throw me into a muddy pit. And even my clothes would hate me.",
  "32": "\"God isn't a man like me. I can't answer him. We can't take each other to court.",
  "33": "I wish someone would settle matters between us. I wish someone would force us to work things out.",
  "34": "I wish someone would keep God from punishing me. Then his terror wouldn't frighten me anymore.",
  "35": "I would speak up without being afraid of him. But as things stand now, I can't do that."
