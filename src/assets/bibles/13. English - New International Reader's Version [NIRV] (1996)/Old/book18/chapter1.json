  "1": "There was a man who lived in the land of Uz. His name was Job. He was honest. He did what was right. He had respect for God and avoided evil.",
  "2": "Job had seven sons and three daughters.",
  "3": "He owned 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels. He owned 500 pairs of oxen and 500 donkeys. He also had a large number of servants. He was the most important man among all of the people in the east.",
  "4": "His sons used to take turns giving big dinners in their homes. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
  "5": "When the time for enjoying good food was over, Job would have his children made pure and clean. He would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them. He would do it early in the morning. He would think, \"Perhaps my children have sinned. Maybe they have spoken evil things against God in their hearts.\" That's what Job always did for his children when he felt they had sinned.",
  "6": "One day angels came to the Lord. Satan also came with them.",
  "7": "The Lord said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" Satan answered, \"From traveling all around the earth. I've been going from one end of it to the other.\"",
  "8": "Then the Lord said to Satan, \"Have you thought about my servant Job? There isn't anyone on earth like him. He is honest. He does what is right. He has respect for me and avoids evil.\"",
  "9": "\"You always give Job everything he needs,\" Satan replied. \"That's why he has respect for you.",
  "10": "Haven't you guarded him and his family? Haven't you taken care of everything he has? You have blessed everything he does. His flocks and herds are spread all through the land.",
  "11": "\"But reach out your hand and strike down everything he has. Then I'm sure he will speak evil things against you. In fact, he'll do it right in front of you.\"",
  "12": "The Lord said to Satan, \"All right. I am handing everything he has over to you. But do not touch the man himself.\" Then Satan left the Lord and went on his way.",
  "13": "One day Job's sons and daughters were at their oldest brother's house. They were enjoying good food and drinking wine.",
  "14": "During that time a messenger came to Job. He said, \"The oxen were plowing. The donkeys were eating grass near them.",
  "15": "Then the Sabeans attacked us and carried the animals off. They killed some of the servants with their swords. I'm the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"",
  "16": "While he was still speaking, a second messenger came. He said, \"God sent lightning from the sky. It struck the sheep and killed them. It burned up some of the servants. I'm the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"",
  "17": "While he was still speaking, a third messenger came. He said, \"The Chaldeans separated themselves into three groups. They attacked your camels and carried them off. They killed the rest of the servants with their swords. I'm the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"",
  "18": "While he was still speaking, a fourth messenger came. He said, \"Your sons and daughters were at their oldest brother's house. They were enjoying good food and drinking wine.",
  "19": "Suddenly a strong wind blew in from the desert. It struck the four corners of the house. The house fell down on your children. Now all of them are dead. I'm the only one who has escaped to tell you!\"",
  "20": "After Job heard all of those reports, he got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground and worshiped the Lord.",
  "21": "He said, \"I was born naked. And I'll leave here naked. You have given, and you have taken away. May your name be praised.\"",
  "22": "In spite of everything, Job didn't sin by blaming God for doing anything wrong."
