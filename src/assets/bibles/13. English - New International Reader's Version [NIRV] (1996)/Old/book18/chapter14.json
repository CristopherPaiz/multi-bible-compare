  "2": "They grow like flowers, and then they dry up. They are like shadows that quickly disappear.",
  "3": "\"God, why do you keep looking at someone like me? Are you planning to take me to court?",
  "4": "Who can bring what is pure from something that isn't pure? No one!",
  "5": "You decide how long anyone will live. You have established the number of his months. You have set a limit to the number of his days.",
  "6": "So look away from him. Leave him alone. Let him put in his time like a hired worker.",
  "7": "\"At least there is hope for a tree. If it's cut down, it will begin to grow again. New branches will appear on it.",
  "8": "Its roots may grow old in the ground. Its stump may die in the soil.",
  "9": "But when it smells water, it will begin to grow. It will send out new growth like a plant.",

  "16": "Then you will count every step I take. But you won't keep track of my sin.",
  "17": "The wrong things I've done will be sealed up in a bag. You will wipe out my sins by forgiving them.",
  "18": "\"A mountain wears away and crumbles. A rock is moved from its place.",
  "19": "Water wears stones away. Storms wash soil away. In the same way, you destroy our hope.",
  "20": "You overpower us completely, and then we're gone. You change the way we look and send us to our graves.",
  "21": "If our children are honored, we don't even know it. If they are dishonored, we don't even see it.",
  "22": "All we feel is the pain of our own bodies. We are full of sadness only for ourselves.\""
