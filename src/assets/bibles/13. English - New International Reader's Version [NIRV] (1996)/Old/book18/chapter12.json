  "2": "\"You people think you know everything, don't you? You are sure that wisdom will die with you!",
  "3": "But I have a brain, just like you. I'm as clever as you are. In fact, everyone knows as much as you do.",
  "4": "\"My friends laugh at me all the time, even though I called out to God and he answered. My friends laugh at me, even though I'm honest and right.",
  "5": "People who have an easy life look down on those who have problems. They think trouble comes only to those whose feet are slipping.",
  "6": "Why doesn't anyone bother the tents of robbers? Why do those who make God angry remain secure? They carry the statues of their gods in their hands!",
  "7": "\"But ask the animals what God does. They will teach you. Or ask the birds of the air. They will tell you.",
  "8": "Or speak to the earth. It will teach you. Or let the fish of the ocean educate you.",

  "17": "He removes the wisdom of advisers and leads them away. He makes judges look foolish.",
  "18": "He sets people free from the chains that kings put on them. Then he dresses the kings in the clothes of slaves.",
  "19": "He removes the authority of priests and leads them away. He removes from their positions those who have been in control for a long time.",
  "20": "He shuts the mouths of trusted advisers. He takes away the understanding of elders.",
  "21": "He looks down on proud leaders. He takes away the strength of those who are mighty.",
  "22": "He tells people the secrets of darkness. He brings evil plans out into the light.",
  "23": "He makes nations great, and then he destroys them. He makes nations grow, and then he scatters them.",
  "24": "He takes away the understanding of the leaders of the earth. He makes them wander in a desert where no one lives.",
  "25": "Without any light, they feel their way along in darkness. God makes them unsteady like those who get drunk."
