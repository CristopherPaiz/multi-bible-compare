  "1": "Job replied,",
  "2": "\"I wish my great pain could be weighed! I wish all of my suffering could be weighed on scales!",
  "3": "I'm sure they would weigh more than the grains of sand on the seashore. No wonder I've been so quick to speak!",
  "4": "The Mighty One has shot me with his arrows. I have to drink their poison. God's terrors are aimed at me.",
  "5": "Does a wild donkey cry out when it has enough grass? Does an ox call out when it has plenty of food?",
  "6": "Is food that doesn't have any taste eaten without salt? Is there any flavor in the white of an egg?",
  "7": "I refuse to touch that kind of food. It makes me sick.",
  "8": "\"I wish I could have what I'm asking for! I wish God would give me what I'm hoping for!",
  "9": "I wish he would crush me! I wish his powerful hand would cut off my life!",
  "10": "Then I'd still have one thing to comfort me. It would be that I haven't said no to the Holy One's commands. That would give me joy in spite of my pain that never ends.",
  "11": "\"I'm so weak that I no longer have any hope. Things have gotten so bad that I can't wait for help anymore.",
  "12": "Am I as strong as stone? Is my body made out of bronze?",
  "13": "I don't have the power to help myself. All hope of success has been taken away from me.",
  "14": "\"A man's friends should love him when his hope is gone. They should be faithful to him even if he stops showing respect for the Mighty One.",
  "15": "But my friends aren't faithful to me. They are like streams that only flow for part of the year. They are like rivers that flow over their banks",
  "16": "when the ice begins to break up. The streams rise when the snow starts to melt.",
  "17": "But they stop flowing when the dry season comes. They disappear from their stream beds when the weather warms up.",
  "18": "Groups of traders turn away from their usual paths. They go up into the dry and empty land. And they die there.",
  "19": "Traders from Tema look for water. Traveling merchants from Sheba also hope to find it.",
  "20": "They become troubled because they had expected to find some. But when they arrive at the stream beds, they don't find any water at all.",
  "21": "And now, my friends, you haven't helped me either. You see the horrible condition I'm in. And that makes you afraid.",
  "22": "I've never said, 'Give me something to help me. Use your wealth to set me free.",
  "23": "Save me from the powerful hand of my enemy. Set me free from the power of mean people.'",
  "24": "\"Teach me. Then I'll be quiet. Show me what I've done wrong.",
  "25": "Honest words are so painful! But your reasoning doesn't prove anything.",
  "26": "Are you trying to correct what I'm saying? You are treating the words of this hopeless man like nothing but wind.",
  "27": "You would even cast lots for those whose fathers have died. You would even trade away your closest friend.",
  "28": "\"But now please look at me. Would I tell you a lie right here in front of you?",
  "29": "Stop what you are saying. Don't be so unfair. Think it over again. You are trying to take my honesty away from me.",
  "30": "Has my mouth spoken anything that is evil? Do my lips say things that are hateful?\""
