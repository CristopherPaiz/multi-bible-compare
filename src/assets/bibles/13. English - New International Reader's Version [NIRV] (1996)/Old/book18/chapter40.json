  "1": "The Lord continued,",
  "2": "\"I am the Mighty One. Will the man who argues with me correct me? Let him who brings charges against me answer me!\"",
  "3": "Job replied to the Lord,",
  "4": "\"I'm not worthy. How can I reply to you? I'm putting my hand over my mouth. I'll stop talking.",
  "5": "I spoke once. But I really don't have any answer. I spoke twice. But I won't say anything else.\"",
  "6": "Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said,",
  "7": "\"Get ready to stand up for yourself. I will ask you some more questions. Then I want you to answer me.",
  "8": "\"Would you dare to claim that I am not being fair? Would you judge me in order to make yourself seem right?",

  "15": "\"Look at the behemoth. It is a huge animal. I made both of you. It eats grass like an ox.",
  "16": "Look at the strength it has in its hips! What power it has in the muscles of its stomach!",
  "17": "Its tail sways back and forth like a cedar tree. The tendons of its thighs are close together.",
  "18": "Its bones are like tubes made out of bronze. Its legs are like rods made out of iron.",
  "19": "It ranks first among my works. I made it. I can approach it with my sword.",
  "20": "The hills produce food for it. All of the other wild animals play near it.",
  "21": "It lies under lotus plants. It hides in tall grass in the swamps.",
  "22": "The lotus plants hide it in their shade. Poplar trees near streams surround it.",
  "23": "It is not afraid when the river roars. It is secure even when the Jordan River rushes against its mouth.",
  "24": "Can anyone capture it by its eyes? Can anyone trap it and poke a hole through its nose?"
