  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied,",
  "2": "\"Job, suppose someone tries to talk to you. Will that make you uneasy? I can't keep from speaking up.",
  "3": "Look, you taught many people. You made weak hands strong.",
  "4": "Your words helped those who had fallen down. You made shaky knees strong.",
  "5": "Now trouble comes to you. And you are unhappy about it. It strikes you down. And you are afraid.",
  "6": "Shouldn't you worship God and trust in him? Shouldn't your honest life give you hope?",

  "18": "God doesn't trust those who serve him. He even brings charges against his angels.",
  "19": "So he'll certainly find fault with human beings. After all, they are made out of dust. They can be crushed more easily than a moth.",
  "20": "Between sunrise and sunset they are broken to pieces. Nobody even notices. They disappear forever.",
  "21": "Like a tent that falls down, they get weak. They die because they didn't follow God's wisdom.' \""
