  "1": "\"Job, can you pull the leviathan out of the sea with a fish hook? Can you tie down its tongue with a rope?",
  "2": "Can you put a rope through its nose? Can you stick a hook through its jaw?",
  "3": "Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak gently to you?",
  "4": "Will it make an agreement with you? Can you make it your slave for life?",
  "5": "Can you make a pet out of it like a bird? Can you put it on a leash for your young women?",
  "6": "Will traders offer you something for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill its body with harpoons? Can you throw fishing spears into its head?",
  "8": "If you touch it, it will fight you. Then you will remember never to touch it again!",
  "9": "No one can possibly control the leviathan. Just looking at it will terrify you.",
  "10": "No one dares to wake it up. So who can possibly stand up to me?",
  "11": "Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything on earth belongs to me.",
  "12": "\"Now I will speak about the leviathan's legs. I will talk about its strength and its graceful body.",
  "13": "Who can strip off its outer coat? Who would try to put a bridle on it?",
  "14": "Who dares to open its jaws? Its mouth is filled with terrifying teeth.",
  "15": "Its back has rows of shields that are close together.",
  "16": "Each one is so close to the next one that not even air can pass between them.",
  "17": "They are joined tightly to one another. They stick together and can't be forced apart.",
  "18": "The leviathan's snorting throws out flashes of light. Its eyes shine like the first light of day.",
  "19": "Fire seems to spray out of its mouth. Sparks of fire shoot out.",
  "20": "Smoke pours out of its nose. It is like smoke from a boiling pot over burning grass.",
  "21": "Its breath sets coals on fire. Flames fly out of its mouth.",
  "22": "Its neck is very strong. People run to get out of its way.",
  "23": "Its rolls of fat are close together. They are firm and can't be moved.",
  "24": "Its chest is as hard as rock. It is as hard as a lower millstone.",
  "25": "When the leviathan rises up, even mighty people are terrified. They run away when it moves around wildly.",
  "26": "A sword that strikes it has no effect. Neither does a spear or dart or javelin.",
  "27": "It treats iron as if it were straw. It crushes bronze as if it were rotten wood.",
  "28": "Arrows do not make it run away. Stones that are thrown from slings are like straw hitting it.",
  "29": "A club seems like a piece of straw to it. It laughs when it hears a javelin rattling.",
  "30": "Its undersides are like broken pieces of pottery. It leaves a trail in the mud like a threshing sled.",
  "31": "It makes the ocean churn like a boiling pot. It stirs up the sea like perfume someone is making.",
  "32": "It leaves a shiny trail behind it. You would think the ocean had white hair.",
  "33": "Nothing on earth is equal to the leviathan. That creature is not afraid of anything.",
  "34": "It looks down on proud people. It rules over all those who are proud.\""
