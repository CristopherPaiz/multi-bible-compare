  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied,",
  "2": "\"Job, if you were wise, would you answer us with a lot of meaningless talk? Would you fill your stomach with the hot east wind?",
  "3": "Would you argue with useless words? Would you give worthless speeches?",
  "4": "But you even cause others to lose their respect for God. You make it hard for them to be faithful to him.",
  "5": "Your sin makes you say evil things. You talk like people who twist the truth.",
  "6": "Your own mouth judges you, not mine. Your own lips witness against you.",
  "7": "\"Are you the first man who was ever born? Were you created before the hills?",
  "8": "Do you listen in when God speaks with his angels? Do you think you are the only wise person?",
  "9": "What do you know that we don't know? What understanding do you have that we don't have?",
  "10": "People who are old and gray are on our side. And they are even older than your parents!",
  "11": "Aren't God's words of comfort enough for you? He speaks them to you gently.",
  "12": "Why have you let your wild ideas carry you away? Why do your eyes flash with anger?",
  "13": "Why do you get so angry with God? Why do words like those pour out of your mouth?",
  "14": "\"Can human beings really be pure? Can mere men really be right with God?",
  "15": "God doesn't trust his holy angels. Even the heavens aren't pure in his sight.",
  "16": "So he'll certainly find fault with human beings. After all, they are evil and sinful. They drink up evil as if it were water.",
  "17": "\"Listen to me. I'll explain things to you. Let me tell you what I've seen.",
  "18": "I'll tell you what those who are wise have said. They don't hide anything they've received from their people of long ago.",
  "19": "The land was given only to those people. Their wisdom didn't come from outsiders. And here's what those who are wise have said.",
  "20": "Sinful people always suffer pain. Mean people suffer all their lives.",
  "21": "Terrifying sounds fill their ears. When everything seems to be going well, robbers attack them.",
  "22": "They lose all hope of escaping the darkness of death. They will certainly be killed with swords.",
  "23": "They wander around. They are like food for vultures. They know that the day they will die is near.",
  "24": "Suffering and pain terrify them. Their troubles overpower them, like a king ready to attack his enemies.",
  "25": "They shake their fists at God. They brag about themselves and oppose the Mighty One.",
  "26": "They boldly charge against him with their thick, strong shields.",
  "27": "\"Their faces are very fat. Their stomachs hang out.",
  "28": "They'll live in towns that have been destroyed. They'll live in houses where no one else lives. The houses will crumble to pieces.",
  "29": "They won't be rich anymore. Their wealth won't last. Their property will no longer spread out over the land.",
  "30": "They won't escape the darkness of death. A flame will dry up everything they have. The breath of God will blow them away.",
  "31": "Don't let them fool themselves by trusting in what is worthless. They won't get anything out of it.",
  "32": "Even before they die, they'll be paid back in full. No matter what they do, it won't succeed.",
  "33": "They'll be like vines that are stripped of their unripe grapes. They'll be like olive trees that drop their flowers.",
  "34": "People who are ungodly won't have any children. Fire will burn up the tents of people who accept money from those who want special favors.",
  "35": "Instead of having children, ungodly people create suffering. All they produce is evil. They are full of lies.\""
