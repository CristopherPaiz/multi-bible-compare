  "1": "\"Job, listen now to my words. Pay attention to everything I say.",
  "2": "I'm about to open my mouth. My words are on the tip of my tongue.",
  "3": "What I say comes from an honest heart. My lips speak only what I know is true.",
  "4": "The Spirit of God has made me. The breath of the Mighty One gives me life.",
  "5": "So answer me if you can. Prepare yourself to face me.",
  "6": "In God's sight I'm just like you. I too have been made out of clay.",
  "7": "You don't have to be afraid of me. My hand won't be too heavy on you.",
  "8": "\"But I heard what you said. And here are the exact words I heard.",
  "9": "You said, 'I'm pure. I haven't sinned in the ways you have charged. I'm clean. I'm not guilty of doing anything wrong.",
  "10": "But God has found fault with me. He thinks I'm his enemy.",
  "11": "He puts my feet in chains. He watches every step I take.'",
  "12": "\"But I'm telling you that you aren't right when you talk like that. After all, God is greater than a mere man.",
  "13": "Why do you claim that God never answers any of our questions?",
  "14": "He speaks in one way and then another. We might not even realize it.",
  "15": "He might speak in a dream or in a vision at night. That's when people are sound asleep in their beds.",
  "16": "He might speak in their ears. His warnings might terrify them.",
  "17": "He warns men in order to turn them away from sinning. He wants to keep them from being proud.",
  "18": "He wants to stop them from going down into the grave. He doesn't want them to be killed with swords.",
  "19": "Someone might be punished by suffering in bed. The pain in his bones might never go away.",
  "20": "He might feel so bad he can't eat anything. He might even hate the finest food.",
  "21": "His body might waste away to nothing. His bones might have been hidden. But now they stick out.",
  "22": "He might approach the very edge of the grave. The messengers of death might come for him.",
  "23": "\"But suppose there is an angel who will speak up for him. The angel is very special. He's one out of a thousand. He will tell that person what is right for him.",
  "24": "He'll be gracious to him. He'll say to God, 'Spare him from going down into the grave. I know a way that can set him free.'",
  "25": "Then his body is made like new again. He becomes as strong and healthy as when he was young.",
  "26": "He prays to God and finds favor with him. He sees God's face and shouts with joy. God makes him right with himself again.",
  "27": "Then the person comes to others and says, 'I sinned. I made what was wrong appear to be right. But I wasn't punished as I should have been.",
  "28": "God set me free. He kept me from going down into the grave. So I'll live to enjoy the light that leads to life.'",
  "29": "\"God does all of those things to people. In fact, he does them again and again.",
  "30": "He wants to stop people from going down into the grave. Then the light that leads to life will shine on them.",
  "31": "\"Pay attention, Job! Listen to me! Be quiet so I can speak.",
  "32": "If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak up. I want to help you be cleared of all charges.",
  "33": "But if you don't have anything to say, listen to me. Be quiet so I can teach you how to be wise.\""
