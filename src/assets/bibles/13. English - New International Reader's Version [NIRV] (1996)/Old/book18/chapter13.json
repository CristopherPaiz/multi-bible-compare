  "1": "\"My eyes have seen everything God has done. My ears have heard it and understood it.",
  "2": "What you know, I also know. I'm as clever as you are.",
  "3": "In fact, I long to speak to the Mighty One. I want to argue my case with God.",
  "4": "But you spread lies about me and take away my good name. If you are trying to heal me, you aren't very good doctors!",
  "5": "I wish you would keep your mouths shut! Then people would think you were wise.",
  "6": "Listen to my case. Listen as I make my appeal.",
  "7": "Will you say evil things in order to help God? Will you tell lies for him?",
  "8": "Do you want to be on God's side? Will you argue his case for him?",
  "9": "Would it turn out well if he looked you over carefully? Could you fool him as you fool others?",
  "10": "He would certainly correct you if you took his side in secret.",
  "11": "Wouldn't his glory terrify you? Wouldn't the fear of him fall on you?",
  "12": "Your sayings are as useless as ashes. The answers you give are as weak as clay.",
  "13": "\"So be quiet and let me speak. Then I won't care what happens to me.",

  "19": "Can others bring charges against me? If they can, I'll keep quiet and die.",
  "20": "\"God, I won't hide from you. Here are the only two things I want.",
  "21": "Keep your powerful hand far away from me. And stop making me so afraid.",
  "22": "Then send for me, and I'll answer. Or let me speak, and you reply.",
  "23": "How many things have I done wrong? How many sins have I committed? Show me my crime. Show me my sin.",
  "24": "Why do you turn your face away from me? Why do you think of me as your enemy?",
  "25": "I'm already like a leaf that is blown by the wind. Are you going to terrify me even more? I'm already like dry straw. Are you going to keep on chasing me?",
  "26": "You write down bitter things against me. You make me suffer for the sins I committed when I was young.",
  "27": "You put my feet in chains. You watch every step I take. You do it by putting marks on the bottom of my feet.",
  "28": "\"People waste away like something that is rotten. They are like clothes that are eaten by moths."
