  "1": "Elihu continued,",
  "2": "\"Hear what I'm saying, you wise men. Listen to me, you who have learned so much.",
  "3": "Our tongues tell us what tastes good and what doesn't. And our ears tell us what's true and what isn't.",
  "4": "So let's choose for ourselves what is right. Let's learn together what is good.",
  "5": "\"Job says, 'I'm not guilty of doing anything wrong. But God doesn't treat me fairly.",
  "6": "Even though I'm right, he thinks I'm a liar. Even though I'm not guilty, his arrows give me wounds that can't be healed.'",
  "7": "Is there any other man like Job? He laughs at God and makes fun of him.",
  "8": "He's a companion of those who do evil. He spends his time with sinful people.",
  "9": "He asks, 'What good is it to try to please God?'",
  "10": "\"So listen to me, you men who have understanding. God would never do what is evil. The Mighty One would never do what is wrong.",
  "11": "He pays a man back for what he's done. He gives him exactly what he should get.",
  "12": "It isn't possible for God to do wrong. The Mighty One would never treat people unfairly.",
  "13": "Who appointed him to rule over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?",
  "14": "If he really wanted to, he could hold back his spirit and breath.",
  "15": "Then everyone would die together. They would return to the dust.",
  "16": "\"Job, if you have understanding, listen to me. Pay attention to what I'm saying.",
  "17": "Can someone who hates to be fair govern? Will you bring charges against the holy and mighty One?",
  "18": "He says to kings, 'You are worthless.' He says to nobles, 'You are evil.'",
  "19": "He doesn't favor princes. He treats rich people and poor people the same. His hands created all of them.",
  "20": "They die suddenly in the middle of the night. God strikes them down, and they pass away. Those who are mighty are removed, but not by human hands.",
  "21": "\"His eyes see how people live. He watches every step they take.",
  "22": "There isn't a dark place or deep shadow where those who do what is evil can hide.",
  "23": "God doesn't need to bring charges against men. He knows they are guilty. So he doesn't need to have them appear in his court to be judged.",
  "24": "He destroys the mighty without asking them questions in court. Then he sets others up in their places.",
  "25": "He knows what they do. So he crushes them during the night.",
  "26": "He punishes them for the sins they commit. He does it where everyone can see them.",
  "27": "That's because they turned away from following him. They didn't have respect for anything he does.",
  "28": "They caused poor people to cry out to him. He heard the cries of those who were in need.",
  "29": "But if he remains silent, who can judge him? If he turns his face away, who can see him? He rules over people and nations alike.",
  "30": "He keeps those who are ungodly from ruling. He keeps them from laying traps for others.",
  "31": "\"Someone might say to God, 'I'm guilty of sinning, but I won't do it anymore.",
  "32": "Show me my sins that I'm not aware of. If I've done what is wrong, I won't do it again.'",
  "33": "But you refuse to turn away from your sins. So God won't treat you the way you want to be treated. You must decide, Job. I can't do it for you. So tell me what you know.",
  "34": "\"You men who have understanding have spoken. You wise men who hear me have said to me,",
  "35": "'Job doesn't know what he's talking about. The things he has said don't make any sense.'",
  "36": "I wish Job would be put to the hardest test! He answered like someone who is evil.",
  "37": "To his sin he adds even more sin. He claps his hands and makes fun of us. He multiplies his words against God.\""
