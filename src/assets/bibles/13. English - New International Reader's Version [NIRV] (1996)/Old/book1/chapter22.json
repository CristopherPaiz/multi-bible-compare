  "9": "They reached the place God had told Abraham about. There Abraham built an altar. He arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son Isaac. He placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.",

  "16": "He said, \"I am taking an oath in my own name. I will bless you because of what you have done,\" announces the Lord. \"You have not held back your son, your only son.",
  "17": "\"So I will certainly bless you. I will make your children after you as many as the stars in the sky. I will make them as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. Your children will take over the cities of their enemies.",
