  "5": "But don't be upset. And don't be angry with yourselves because you sold me here. God sent me ahead of you to save many lives.",
  "6": "\"For two years now, there hasn't been enough food in the land. And for the next five years, people won't be plowing or gathering crops.",
  "7": "But God sent me ahead of you to keep some of you alive on earth. He sent me here to save your lives by an act of mighty power.",
  "8": "\"So then, it wasn't you who sent me here. It was God. He made me like a father to Pharaoh. He made me master of Pharaoh's whole house. He made me ruler of the whole land of Egypt.",
  "9": "\"Now hurry back to my father. Say to him, 'Your son Joseph says, \"God has made me master of the whole land of Egypt. Come down to me. Don't waste any time.",
  "10": "You will live in the area of Goshen. You, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you have will be near me.",

  "12": "\"Brothers, you can see for yourselves that it's really I, Joseph, speaking to you. My brother Benjamin can see it too.",
  "13": "\"Tell my father about all of the honor that has been given to me in Egypt. Tell him about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.\"",
  "14": "Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and sobbed. Benjamin also hugged him and sobbed.",
  "15": "Joseph kissed all of his brothers and sobbed over them. After that, his brothers talked with him.",
  "16": "The news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come. Pharaoh and all of his officials were pleased.",
  "17": "Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Here's what I want you to tell your brothers. Say to them, 'Load your animals. Return to the land of Canaan.",

  "26": "They told him, \"Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of the whole land of Egypt.\" Jacob was shocked. He didn't believe them.",
  "27": "So they told him everything Joseph had said to them. Jacob saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back. That gave new life to their father Jacob.",
  "28": "Israel said, \"I believe it now! My son Joseph is still alive. I'll go and see him before I die.\""
