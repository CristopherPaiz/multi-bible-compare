  "13": "Then the Lord God said to the woman, \"What have you done?\" The woman said, \"The serpent tricked me. That's why I ate the fruit.\"",
  "14": "So the Lord God spoke to the serpent. He said, \"Because you have done this, \"I am putting a curse on you. You are cursed more than all of the livestock and all of the wild animals. You will crawl on the ground. You will eat dust all of the days of your life.",
