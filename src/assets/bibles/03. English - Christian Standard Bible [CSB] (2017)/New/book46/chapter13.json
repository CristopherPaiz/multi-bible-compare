  "5": "is not rude, is not self-seeking, is not irritable, and does not keep a record of wrongs.",
  "6": "Love finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth.",
  "7": "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.",

  "11": "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things.",
  "12": "For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known.",
  "13": "Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love — but the greatest of these is love."
