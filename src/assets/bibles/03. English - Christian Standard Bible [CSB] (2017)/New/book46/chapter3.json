  "1": "For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.",
  "2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready,",
  "3": "because you are still worldly. For since there is envy and strife among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans?",
  "4": "For whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not acting like mere humans?",
  "5": "What then is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.",
  "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.",
  "7": "So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.",
  "8": "Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
  "9": "For we are God’s coworkers. You are God’s field, God’s building.",
  "10": "According to God’s grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, and another builds on it. But each one is to be careful how he builds on it.",
  "11": "For no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid down. That foundation is Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
  "13": "each one’s work will become obvious. For the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one’s work.",
  "14": "If anyone’s work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward.",
  "15": "If anyone’s work is burned up, he will experience loss, but he himself will be saved  — but only as through fire.",
  "16": "Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?",
  "17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and that is what you are.",
  "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he can become wise.",
  "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written, He catches the wise in their craftiness;",
  "20": "and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile.",
  "21": "So let no one boast in human leaders, for everything is yours  —",
  "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come  — everything is yours,",
  "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."
