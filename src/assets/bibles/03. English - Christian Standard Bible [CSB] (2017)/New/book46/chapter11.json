  "1": "Imitate me, as I also imitate Christ.",
  "2": "Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold fast to the traditions just as I delivered them to you.",
  "3": "But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.",
  "4": "Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head.",
  "5": "Every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since that is one and the same as having her head shaved.",
  "6": "For if a woman doesn’t cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her head be covered.",
  "7": "A man should not cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God. So too, woman is the glory of man.",
  "8": "For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.",
  "9": "Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.",
  "10": "This is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.",
  "11": "In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, and man is not independent of woman.",
  "12": "For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman, and all things come from God.",
  "13": "Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?",
  "14": "Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him,",
  "15": "but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.",
  "16": "If anyone wants to argue about this, we have no other custom, nor do the churches of God.",
  "17": "Now in giving this instruction I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.",
  "18": "For to begin with, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.",
  "19": "Indeed, it is necessary that there be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.",
  "20": "When you come together, then, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper.",
  "21": "For at the meal, each one eats his own supper. So one person is hungry while another gets drunk!",
  "22": "Don’t you have homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you in this matter!",
  "23": "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread,",
  "24": "and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”",
  "25": "In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”",
  "26": "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.",
  "27": "So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sin against the body and blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "Let a person examine himself; in this way let him eat the bread and drink from the cup.",
  "29": "For whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.",
  "30": "This is why many are sick and ill among you, and many have fallen asleep.",
  "31": "If we were properly judging ourselves, we would not be judged,",
  "32": "but when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined, so that we may not be condemned with the world.",
  "33": "Therefore, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, welcome one another.",
  "34": "If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather together you will not come under judgment. I will give instructions about the other matters whenever I come."
