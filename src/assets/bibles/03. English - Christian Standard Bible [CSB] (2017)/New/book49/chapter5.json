  "1": "Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children,",
  "2": "and walk in love, as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.",
  "3": "But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of among you, as is proper for saints.",
  "4": "Obscene and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks.",
  "5": "For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s wrath is coming on the disobedient because of these things.",
  "7": "Therefore, do not become their partners.",
  "8": "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light  —",
  "9": "for the fruit of the light consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth  —",
  "10": "testing what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Don’t participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them.",
  "12": "For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret.",
  "13": "Everything exposed by the light is made visible,",
  "14": "for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.",

  "21": "submitting to one another in the fear of Christ.",

  "26": "to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word.",
  "27": "He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.",
  "28": "In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",

  "30": "since we are members of his body.",
