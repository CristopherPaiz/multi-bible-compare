  "1": "My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "2": "For if someone comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor person dressed in filthy clothes also comes in,",
  "3": "if you look with favor on the one wearing the fine clothes and say, “Sit here in a good place,” and yet you say to the poor person, “Stand over there,” or “Sit here on the floor by my footstool,”",
  "4": "haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?",
  "5": "Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Didn’t God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?",
  "6": "Yet you have dishonored the poor. Don’t the rich oppress you and drag you into court?",
  "7": "Don’t they blaspheme the good name that was invoked over you?",
  "8": "Indeed, if you fulfill the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, Love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.",
  "9": "If, however, you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.",
  "10": "For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.",
  "11": "For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you are a lawbreaker.",
  "12": "Speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.",
  "13": "For judgment is without mercy to the one who has not shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.",
  "14": "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can such faith save him?",
  "15": "If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food",
  "16": "and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, stay warm, and be well fed,” but you don’t give them what the body needs, what good is it?",
  "17": "In the same way faith, if it doesn’t have works, is dead by itself.",
  "18": "But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith by my works.",
  "19": "You believe that God is one. Good! Even the demons believe — and they shudder.",
  "20": "Senseless person! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless?",
  "21": "Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works in offering Isaac his son on the altar?",
  "22": "You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete,",
  "23": "and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God’s friend.",
  "24": "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.",
  "25": "In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works in receiving the messengers and sending them out by a different route?",
  "26": "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
