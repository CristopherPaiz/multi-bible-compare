  "1": "For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery.",
  "2": "Take note! I, Paul, am telling you that if you get yourselves circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all.",
  "3": "Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to do the entire law.",
  "4": "You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.",
  "5": "For we eagerly await through the Spirit, by faith, the hope of righteousness.",
  "6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.",
  "7": "You were running well. Who prevented you from being persuaded regarding the truth?",
  "8": "This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.",
  "9": "A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough.",
  "10": "I myself am persuaded in the Lord you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.",
  "11": "Now brothers and sisters, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.",
  "12": "I wish those who are disturbing you might also let themselves be mutilated!",
  "13": "For you were called to be free, brothers and sisters; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love.",
  "14": "For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself.",
  "15": "But if you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another.",
  "16": "I say then, walk by the Spirit and you will certainly not carry out the desire of the flesh.",
  "17": "For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want.",
  "18": "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",
  "19": "Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity,",
  "20": "idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,",
  "21": "envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar. I am warning you about these things — as I warned you before — that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.",
  "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,",
  "23": "gentleness, and self-control. The law is not against such things.",
  "24": "Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.",
  "25": "If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.",
  "26": "Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
