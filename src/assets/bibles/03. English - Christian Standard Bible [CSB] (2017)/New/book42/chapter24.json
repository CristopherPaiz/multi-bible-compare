{
  "1": "On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.",
  "2": "They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.",
  "3": "They went in but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
  "4": "While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood by them in dazzling clothes.",
  "5": "So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground. “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” asked the men.",
  "6": "“He is not here, but he has risen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,",
  "7": "saying, ‘It is necessary that the Son of Man be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day’?”",
  "8": "And they remembered his words.",
  "9": "Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest.",
  "10": "Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them were telling the apostles these things.",
  "11": "But these words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.",
  "12": "Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. When he stooped to look in, he saw only the linen cloths. So he went away, amazed at what had happened.",
  "13": "Now that same day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.",
  "14": "Together they were discussing everything that had taken place.",
  "15": "And while they were discussing and arguing, Jesus himself came near and began to walk along with them.",
  "16": "But they were prevented from recognizing him.",
  "17": "Then he asked them, “What is this dispute that you’re having with each other as you are walking?” And they stopped walking and looked discouraged.",
  "18": "The one named Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days?”",
  "19": "“What things?” he asked them. So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in action and speech before God and all the people,",
  "20": "and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him.",
  "21": "But we were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, it’s the third day since these things happened.",
  "22": "Moreover, some women from our group astounded us. They arrived early at the tomb,",
  "23": "and when they didn’t find his body, they came and reported that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.",
  "24": "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”",
  "25": "He said to them, “How foolish and slow you are to believe all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "26": "Wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and enter into his glory?”",
  "27": "Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures.",
  "28": "They came near the village where they were going, and he gave the impression that he was going farther.",
  "29": "But they urged him, “Stay with us, because it’s almost evening, and now the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.",
  "30": "It was as he reclined at the table with them that he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.",
  "31": "Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, but he disappeared from their sight.",
  "32": "They said to each other, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he was talking with us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us?”",
  "33": "That very hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the Eleven and those with them gathered together,",
  "34": "who said, “The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!”",
  "35": "Then they began to describe what had happened on the road and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.",
  "36": "As they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst. He said to them, “Peace to you!”",
  "37": "But they were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost.",
  "38": "“Why are you troubled?” he asked them. “And why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
  "39": "Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have.”",
  "40": "Having said this, he showed them his hands and feet.",
  "41": "But while they still were amazed and in disbelief because of their joy, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”",
  "42": "So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish,",
  "43": "and he took it and ate in their presence.",
  "44": "He told them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you — that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”",
  "45": "Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.",
  "46": "He also said to them, “This is what is written: The Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead the third day,",
  "47": "and repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.",
  "48": "You are witnesses of these things.",
  "49": "And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. As for you, stay in the city until you are empowered from on high.”",
  "50": "Then he led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.",
  "51": "And while he was blessing them, he left them and was carried up into heaven.",
  "52": "After worshiping him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.",
  "53": "And they were continually in the temple praising God."
