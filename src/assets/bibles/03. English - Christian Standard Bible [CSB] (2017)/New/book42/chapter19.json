  "7": "All who saw it began to complain, “He’s gone to stay with a sinful man.”",
  "8": "But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Look, I’ll give half of my possessions to the poor, Lord. And if I have extorted anything from anyone, I’ll pay back four times as much.”",
  "9": "“Today salvation has come to this house,” Jesus told him, “because he too is a son of Abraham.",
  "10": "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.”",
  "11": "As they were listening to this, he went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away.",
  "12": "Therefore he said: “A nobleman traveled to a far country to receive for himself authority to be king and then to return.",
  "13": "He called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and told them, ‘Engage in business until I come back.’",
  "14": "“But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to rule over us.’",
  "15": "“At his return, having received the authority to be king, he summoned those servants he had given the money to, so that he could find out how much they had made in business.",

  "18": "“The second came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’",
  "19": "“So he said to him, ‘You will be over five towns.’",
  "20": "“And another came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina. I have kept it safe in a cloth",
  "21": "because I was afraid of you since you’re a harsh man: you collect what you didn’t deposit and reap what you didn’t sow.’",
  "22": "“He told him, ‘I will condemn you by what you have said, you evil servant! If you knew I was a harsh man, collecting what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow,",
  "23": "why, then, didn’t you put my money in the bank? And when I returned, I would have collected it with interest.’",
  "24": "So he said to those standing there, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’",
  "25": "“But they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas.’",
  "26": "“‘I tell you, that to everyone who has, more will be given; and from the one who does not have, even what he does have will be taken away.",

  "29": "As he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples",
  "30": "and said, “Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.",
  "31": "If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it? ’ say this: ‘The Lord needs it.’”",
  "32": "So those who were sent left and found it just as he had told them.",
  "33": "As they were untying the young donkey, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the donkey?”",
  "34": "“The Lord needs it,” they said.",

  "38": "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven!",
  "39": "Some of the Pharisees from the crowd told him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”",

  "41": "As he approached and saw the city, he wept for it,",
  "42": "saying, “If you knew this day what would bring peace — but now it is hidden from your eyes.",
  "43": "For the days will come on you when your enemies will build a barricade around you, surround you, and hem you in on every side.",
  "44": "They will crush you and your children among you to the ground, and they will not leave one stone on another in your midst, because you did not recognize the time when God visited you.”",

  "46": "and he said, “It is written, my house will be a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!”",
