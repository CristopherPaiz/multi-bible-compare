  "1": "All the tax collectors and sinners were approaching to listen to him.",
  "2": "And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”",
  "3": "So he told them this parable:",
  "4": "“What man among you, who has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open field and go after the lost one until he finds it?",
  "5": "When he has found it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders,",
  "6": "and coming home, he calls his friends and neighbors together, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my lost sheep!’",
  "7": "I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don’t need repentance.",
  "8": "“Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?",
  "9": "When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found the silver coin I lost!’",
  "10": "I tell you, in the same way, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”",
  "11": "He also said: “A man had two sons.",
  "12": "The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate I have coming to me.’ So he distributed the assets to them.",
  "13": "Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he had and traveled to a distant country, where he squandered his estate in foolish living.",
  "14": "After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he had nothing.",
  "15": "Then he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.",
  "16": "He longed to eat his fill from the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one would give him anything.",
  "17": "When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have more than enough food, and here I am dying of hunger!",
  "18": "I’ll get up, go to my father, and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.",
  "19": "I’m no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers.”’",
  "20": "So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him.",
  "21": "The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son.’",
  "22": "“But the father told his servants, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.",
  "23": "Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let’s celebrate with a feast,",
  "24": "because this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! ’ So they began to celebrate.",
  "25": "“Now his older son was in the field; as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.",
  "26": "So he summoned one of the servants, questioning what these things meant.",
  "27": "‘Your brother is here,’ he told him, ‘and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’",
  "28": "“Then he became angry and didn’t want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.",
  "29": "But he replied to his father, ‘Look, I have been slaving many years for you, and I have never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends.",
  "30": "But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’",
  "31": "“‘Son,’ he said to him, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.",
  "32": "But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”"
