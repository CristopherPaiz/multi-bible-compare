  "1": "Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ: To those who have received a faith equal to ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.",
  "2": "May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.",
  "3": "His divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.",
  "4": "By these he has given us very great and precious promises, so that through them you may share in the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire.",
  "5": "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge,",
  "6": "knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness,",
  "7": "godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.",
  "8": "For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "9": "The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins.",
  "10": "Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble.",
  "11": "For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.",
  "12": "Therefore I will always remind you about these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you now have.",
  "13": "I think it is right, as long as I am in this bodily tent, to wake you up with a reminder,",
  "14": "since I know that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has indeed made clear to me.",
  "15": "And I will also make every effort so that you are able to recall these things at any time after my departure.",
  "16": "For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.",
  "17": "For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased!”",
  "18": "We ourselves heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.",
  "19": "We also have the prophetic word strongly confirmed, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.",
  "20": "Above all, you know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from the prophet’s own interpretation,",
  "21": "because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
