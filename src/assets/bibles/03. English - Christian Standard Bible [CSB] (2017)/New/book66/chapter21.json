  "3": "Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God.",

  "5": "Then the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”",
  "6": "Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life.",
  "7": "The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son.",
  "8": "But the cowards, faithless, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars  — their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”",
  "9": "Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”",
  "10": "He then carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,",
  "11": "arrayed with God’s glory. Her radiance was like a precious jewel, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.",

  "13": "There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.",
  "14": "The city wall had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb were on the foundations.",
  "15": "The one who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.",
  "16": "The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 stadia. Its length, width, and height are equal.",
  "17": "Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used.",
  "18": "The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold clear as glass.",
  "19": "The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of jewel: the first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,",
  "20": "the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.",

  "24": "The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.",
  "25": "Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there.",
  "26": "They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.",
  "27": "Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Lamb’s book of life."
