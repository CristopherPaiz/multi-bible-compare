  "1": "“Write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: Thus says the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven golden lampstands:",
  "2": "I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you have found them to be liars.",
  "3": "I know that you have persevered and endured hardships for the sake of my name, and have not grown weary.",
  "4": "But I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.",
  "5": "Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.",
  "6": "Yet you do have this: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.",
  "7": "“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.",
  "8": "“Write to the angel of the church in Smyrna: Thus says the First and the Last, the one who was dead and came to life:",
  "9": "I know your affliction and poverty, but you are rich. I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.",
  "10": "Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will experience affliction for ten days. Be faithful to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.",

  "13": "I know where you live — where Satan’s throne is. Yet you are holding on to my name and did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness who was put to death among you, where Satan lives.",
  "14": "But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block in front of the Israelites: to eat meat sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.",
  "15": "In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.",
  "16": "So repent! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.",
  "17": "“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.",

  "23": "I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who examines minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works.",
  "24": "I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who haven’t known “the so-called secrets of Satan” — as they say — I am not putting any other burden on you.",
  "25": "Only hold on to what you have until I come.",
  "26": "The one who conquers and who keeps my works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations —",
  "27": "and he will rule them with an iron scepter; he will shatter them like pottery —",
  "28": "just as I have received this from my Father. I will also give him the morning star.",
