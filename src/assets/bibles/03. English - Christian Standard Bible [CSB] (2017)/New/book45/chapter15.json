  "1": "Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves.",
  "2": "Each one of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.",
  "3": "For even Christ did not please himself. On the contrary, as it is written, The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.",
  "4": "For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the Scriptures.",
  "5": "Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus,",
  "6": "so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one voice.",
  "7": "Therefore accept one another, just as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God.",
  "8": "For I say that Christ became a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises to the fathers,",
  "9": "and so that Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to your name.",
  "10": "Again it says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people!",
  "11": "And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples praise him!",

  "15": "Nevertheless, I have written to remind you more boldly on some points because of the grace given me by God",
  "16": "to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the gospel of God. My purpose is that the Gentiles may be an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.",
  "17": "Therefore I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus regarding what pertains to God.",
  "18": "For I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me by word and deed for the obedience of the Gentiles,",
  "19": "by the power of miraculous signs and wonders, and by the power of God’s Spirit. As a result, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum.",
  "20": "My aim is to preach the gospel where Christ has not been named, so that I will not build on someone else’s foundation,",
  "21": "but, as it is written, Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.",
  "22": "That is why I have been prevented many times from coming to you.",
  "23": "But now I no longer have any work to do in these regions, and I have strongly desired for many years to come to you",
  "24": "whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.",
  "25": "Right now I am traveling to Jerusalem to serve the saints,",
  "26": "because Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.",
  "27": "Yes, they were pleased, and indeed are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual benefits, then they are obligated to minister to them in material needs.",
  "28": "So when I have finished this and safely delivered the funds to them, I will visit you on the way to Spain.",
  "29": "I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.",
  "30": "Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in fervent prayers to God on my behalf.",
  "31": "Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,",
  "32": "and that, by God’s will, I may come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you.",
  "33": "May the God of peace be with all of you. Amen."
