  "1": "Therefore, every one of you who judges is without excuse. For when you judge another, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things.",
  "2": "We know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth.",
  "3": "Do you really think — anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same — that you will escape God’s judgment?",
  "4": "Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?",
  "5": "Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.",
  "6": "He will repay each one according to his works:",
  "7": "eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality;",
  "8": "but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness.",
  "9": "There will be affliction and distress for every human being who does evil, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek;",
  "10": "but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does what is good, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.",
  "11": "For there is no favoritism with God.",
  "12": "All who sin without the law will also perish without the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.",
  "13": "For the hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.",
  "14": "So, when Gentiles, who do not by nature have the law, do what the law demands, they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law.",
  "15": "They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts. Their consciences confirm this. Their competing thoughts either accuse or even excuse them",
  "16": "on the day when God judges what people have kept secret, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus.",
  "17": "Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast in God,",
  "18": "and know his will, and approve the things that are superior, being instructed from the law,",
  "19": "and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,",
  "20": "an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and truth in the law —",
  "21": "you then, who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach, “You must not steal” — do you steal?",
  "22": "You who say, “You must not commit adultery” — do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob their temples?",
  "23": "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",
  "24": "For, as it is written: The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.",
  "25": "Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
  "26": "So if an uncircumcised man keeps the law’s requirements, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?",
  "27": "A man who is physically uncircumcised, but who keeps the law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker in spite of having the letter of the law and circumcision.",
  "28": "For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, and true circumcision is not something visible in the flesh.",
  "29": "On the contrary, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart — by the Spirit, not the letter. That person’s praise is not from people but from God."
