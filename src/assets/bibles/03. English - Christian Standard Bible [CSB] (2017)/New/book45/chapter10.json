  "1": "Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation.",
  "2": "I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.",
  "3": "Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness.",
  "4": "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes,",
  "5": "since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them.",
  "6": "But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, “Who will go up to heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down",
  "7": "or, “Who will go down into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.",
  "8": "On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim:",

  "16": "But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message?",
  "17": "So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.",
  "18": "But I ask, “Did they not hear?” Yes, they did: Their voice has gone out to the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the world.",
  "19": "But I ask, “Did Israel not understand?” First, Moses said, I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that lacks understanding.",
  "20": "And Isaiah says boldly, I was found by those who were not looking for me; I revealed myself to those who were not asking for me.",
  "21": "But to Israel he says, All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and defiant people."
