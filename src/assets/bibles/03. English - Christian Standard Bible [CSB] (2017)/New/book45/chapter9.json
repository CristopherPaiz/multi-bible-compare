  "1": "I speak the truth in Christ  — I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit  —",
  "2": "that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.",
  "3": "For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood.",
  "4": "They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises.",
  "5": "The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen.",
  "6": "Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.",
  "7": "Neither are all of Abraham’s children his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac.",
  "8": "That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring.",
  "9": "For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.",
  "10": "And not only that, but Rebekah conceived children through one man, our father Isaac.",
  "11": "For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to election might stand —",
  "12": "not from works but from the one who calls — she was told, The older will serve the younger.",
  "13": "As it is written: I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.",
  "14": "What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!",
  "15": "For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.",
  "16": "So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy.",
  "17": "For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth.",
  "18": "So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.",
  "19": "You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”",
  "20": "But who are you, a mere man, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”",
  "21": "Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor?",
  "22": "And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction?",
  "23": "And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory  —",
  "24": "on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?",
  "25": "As it also says in Hosea, I will call Not My People, My People, and she who is Unloved, Beloved.",
  "26": "And it will be in the place where they were told, you are not my people, there they will be called sons of the living God.",
  "27": "But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, Though the number of Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved;",
  "28": "since the Lord will execute his sentence completely and decisively on the earth.",
  "29": "And just as Isaiah predicted: If the Lord of Hosts had not left us offspring, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.",
  "30": "What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness — namely the righteousness that comes from faith.",
  "31": "But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not achieved the righteousness of the law.",
  "32": "Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.",
  "33": "As it is written, Look, I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over and a rock to trip over, and the one who believes on him will not be put to shame."
