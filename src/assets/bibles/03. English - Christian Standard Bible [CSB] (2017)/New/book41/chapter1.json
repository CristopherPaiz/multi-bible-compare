  "3": "A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight!",
  "4": "John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
  "5": "The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.",
  "6": "John wore a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.",

  "20": "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
  "21": "They went into Capernaum, and right away he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.",
  "22": "They were astonished at his teaching because he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.",
  "23": "Just then a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. He cried out,",
  "24": "“What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!”",
  "25": "Jesus rebuked him saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”",
  "26": "And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him.",
  "27": "They were all amazed, and so they began to ask each other: “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”",
  "28": "At once the news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee.",
  "29": "As soon as they left the synagogue, they went into Simon and Andrew’s house with James and John.",
  "30": "Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once.",
  "31": "So he went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.",
  "32": "When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all those who were sick and demon-possessed.",
  "33": "The whole town was assembled at the door,",
  "34": "and he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.",
  "35": "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up, went out, and made his way to a deserted place; and there he was praying.",
  "36": "Simon and his companions searched for him,",
  "37": "and when they found him they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”",
  "38": "And he said to them, “Let’s go on to the neighboring villages so that I may preach there too. This is why I have come.”",

  "41": "Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. “I am willing,” he told him. “Be made clean.”",
  "42": "Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.",
  "43": "Then he sternly warned him and sent him away at once,",
  "44": "telling him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”",
  "45": "Yet he went out and began to proclaim it widely and to spread the news, with the result that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. But he was out in deserted places, and they came to him from everywhere."
