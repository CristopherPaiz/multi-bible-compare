  "1": "For this reason, we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away.",
  "2": "For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,",
  "3": "how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation had its beginning when it was spoken of by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.",

  "15": "and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death.",
  "16": "For it is clear that he does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham’s offspring.",
