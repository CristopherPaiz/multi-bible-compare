  "1": "Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways.",
  "2": "In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him.",
  "3": "The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.",
  "4": "So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.",
  "5": "For to which of the angels did he ever say, You are my Son; today I have become your Father, or again, I will be his Father, and he will be my Son?",
  "6": "Again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, And let all God’s angels worship him.",
  "7": "And about the angels he says: He makes his angels winds, and his servants a fiery flame,",
  "8": "but to the Son: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.",
  "9": "You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; this is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy beyond your companions.",

  "12": "you will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like clothing. But you are the same, and your years will never end.",
  "13": "Now to which of the angels has he ever said: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool?",
  "14": "Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?"
