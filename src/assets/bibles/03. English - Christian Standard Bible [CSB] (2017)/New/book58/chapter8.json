  "1": "Now the main point of what is being said is this: We have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,",
  "2": "a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man.",
  "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.",
  "4": "Now if he were on earth, he wouldn’t be a priest, since there are those offering the gifts prescribed by the law.",
  "5": "These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.",
  "6": "But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.",
  "7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one.",
  "8": "But finding fault with his people, he says: See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah —",
  "9": "not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. I showed no concern for them, says the Lord, because they did not continue in my covenant.",
  "10": "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.",
  "11": "And each person will not teach his fellow citizen, and each his brother or sister, saying, “Know the Lord,” because they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them.",
  "12": "For I will forgive their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins.",
  "13": "By saying a new covenant, he has declared that the first is obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old is about to pass away."
