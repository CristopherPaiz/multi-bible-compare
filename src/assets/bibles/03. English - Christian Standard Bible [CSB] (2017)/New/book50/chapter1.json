  "1": "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus: To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons.",
  "2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "3": "I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you,",
  "4": "always praying with joy for all of you in my every prayer,",
  "5": "because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.",
  "6": "I am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.",
  "7": "Indeed, it is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, and you are all partners with me in grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.",
  "8": "For God is my witness, how deeply I miss all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.",
  "9": "And I pray this: that your love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,",
  "10": "so that you may approve the things that are superior and may be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,",
  "11": "filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.",
  "12": "Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually advanced the gospel,",
  "13": "so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard, and to everyone else, that my imprisonment is because I am in Christ.",
  "14": "Most of the brothers have gained confidence in the Lord from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the word fearlessly.",
  "15": "To be sure, some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of good will.",
  "16": "These preach out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;",
  "17": "the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking that they will cause me trouble in my imprisonment.",
  "18": "What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice",
  "19": "because I know this will lead to my salvation through your prayers and help from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.",
  "20": "My eager expectation and hope is that I will not be ashamed about anything, but that now as always, with all courage, Christ will be highly honored in my body, whether by life or by death.",
  "21": "For me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.",
  "22": "Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful work for me; and I don’t know which one I should choose.",
  "23": "I am torn between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ  — which is far better  —",
  "24": "but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.",
  "25": "Since I am persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,",
  "26": "so that, because of my coming to you again, your boasting in Christ Jesus may abound.",
  "27": "Just one thing: As citizens of heaven, live your life worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, in one accord, contending together for the faith of the gospel,",
  "28": "not being frightened in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction for them, but of your salvation  — and this is from God.",
  "29": "For it has been granted to you on Christ’s behalf not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,",
  "30": "since you are engaged in the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I have."
