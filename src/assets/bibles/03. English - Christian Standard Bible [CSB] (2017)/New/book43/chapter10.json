  "1": "“Truly I tell you, anyone who doesn’t enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber.",
  "2": "The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.",
  "3": "The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
  "4": "When he has brought all his own outside, he goes ahead of them. The sheep follow him because they know his voice.",
  "5": "They will never follow a stranger; instead they will run away from him, because they don’t know the voice of strangers.”",
  "6": "Jesus gave them this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.",
  "7": "Jesus said again, “Truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.",
  "8": "All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.",
  "9": "I am the gate. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.",
  "10": "A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it in abundance.",
  "11": "“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
  "12": "The hired hand, since he is not the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, leaves them and runs away when he sees a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches and scatters them.",
  "13": "This happens because he is a hired hand and doesn’t care about the sheep.",
  "14": "“I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me,",
  "15": "just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.",
  "16": "But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd.",
  "17": "This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again.",
  "18": "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”",
  "19": "Again the Jews were divided because of these words.",
  "20": "Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and he’s crazy. Why do you listen to him?”",
  "21": "Others were saying, “These aren’t the words of someone who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”",
  "22": "Then the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem, and it was winter.",
  "23": "Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s Colonnade.",
  "24": "The Jews surrounded him and asked, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”",
  "25": "“I did tell you and you don’t believe,” Jesus answered them. “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify about me.",
  "26": "But you don’t believe because you are not of my sheep.",
  "27": "My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me.",
  "28": "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.",
  "29": "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.",
  "30": "I and the Father are one.”",
  "31": "Again the Jews picked up rocks to stone him.",
  "32": "Jesus replied, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these works are you stoning me?”",
  "33": "“We aren’t stoning you for a good work,” the Jews answered, “but for blasphemy, because you — being a man — make yourself God.”",
  "34": "Jesus answered them, “Isn’t it written in your law, I said, you are gods?",
  "35": "If he called those whom the word of God came to ‘gods’ — and the Scripture cannot be broken —",
  "36": "do you say, ‘You are blaspheming’ to the one the Father set apart and sent into the world, because I said: I am the Son of God?",
  "37": "If I am not doing my Father’s works, don’t believe me.",
  "38": "But if I am doing them and you don’t believe me, believe the works. This way you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I in the Father.”",
  "39": "Then they were trying again to seize him, but he eluded their grasp.",
  "40": "So he departed again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.",
  "41": "Many came to him and said, “John never did a sign, but everything John said about this man was true.”",
  "42": "And many believed in him there."
