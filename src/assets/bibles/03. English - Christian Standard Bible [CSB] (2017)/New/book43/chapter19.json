  "1": "Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.",
  "2": "The soldiers also twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and clothed him in a purple robe.",
  "3": "And they kept coming up to him and saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and were slapping his face.",
  "4": "Pilate went outside again and said to them, “Look, I’m bringing him out to you to let you know I find no grounds for charging him.”",
  "5": "Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”",
  "6": "When the chief priests and the temple servants saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate responded, “Take him and crucify him yourselves, since I find no grounds for charging him.”",
  "7": "“We have a law,” the Jews replied to him, “and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.”",
  "8": "When Pilate heard this statement, he was more afraid than ever.",
  "9": "He went back into the headquarters and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer.",
  "10": "So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?”",
  "11": "“You would have no authority over me at all,” Jesus answered him, “if it hadn’t been given you from above. This is why the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.”",
  "12": "From that moment Pilate kept trying to release him. But the Jews shouted, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend. Anyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar!”",

  "19": "Pilate also had a sign made and put on the cross. It said: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
  "20": "Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.",
  "21": "So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”",
  "22": "Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.”",
  "23": "When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, a part for each soldier. They also took the tunic, which was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.",
  "24": "So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it, to see who gets it.” This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled that says: They divided my clothes among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing. This is what the soldiers did.",

  "33": "When they came to Jesus, they did not break his legs since they saw that he was already dead.",
  "34": "But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out.",
  "35": "He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows he is telling the truth.",
  "36": "For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: Not one of his bones will be broken.",
  "37": "Also, another Scripture says: They will look at the one they pierced.",
  "38": "After this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus — but secretly because of his fear of the Jews — asked Pilate that he might remove Jesus’s body. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and took his body away.",
