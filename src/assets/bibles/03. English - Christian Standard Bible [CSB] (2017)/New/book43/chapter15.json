  "1": "“I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.",
  "2": "Every branch in me that does not produce fruit he removes, and he prunes every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce more fruit.",
  "3": "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.",
  "4": "Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.",
  "5": "I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.",
  "6": "If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown aside like a branch and he withers. They gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.",
  "7": "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be done for you.",
  "8": "My Father is glorified by this: that you produce much fruit and prove to be my disciples.",
  "9": "“As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in my love.",
  "10": "If you keep my commands you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love.",
  "11": "“I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.",
  "12": "“This is my command: Love one another as I have loved you.",
  "13": "No one has greater love than this: to lay down his life for his friends.",
  "14": "You are my friends if you do what I command you.",
  "15": "I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from my Father.",
  "16": "You did not choose me, but I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.",
  "17": "“This is what I command you: Love one another.",
  "18": "“If the world hates you, understand that it hated me before it hated you.",
  "19": "If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you.",
  "20": "Remember the word I spoke to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.",
  "21": "But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they don’t know the one who sent me.",
  "22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "The one who hates me also hates my Father.",
  "24": "If I had not done the works among them that no one else has done, they would not have sin. Now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.",
  "25": "But this happened so that the statement written in their law might be fulfilled: They hated me for no reason.",
  "26": "“When the Counselor comes, the one I will send to you from the Father — the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father — he will testify about me.",
  "27": "You also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning."
