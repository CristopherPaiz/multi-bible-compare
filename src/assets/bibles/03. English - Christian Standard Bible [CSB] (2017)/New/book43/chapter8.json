  "1": "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.",
  "2": "At dawn he went to the temple again, and all the people were coming to him. He sat down and began to teach them.",
  "3": "Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, making her stand in the center.",
  "4": "“Teacher,” they said to him, “this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.",
  "5": "In the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?”",
  "6": "They asked this to trap him, in order that they might have evidence to accuse him. Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger.",
  "7": "When they persisted in questioning him, he stood up and said to them, “The one without sin among you should be the first to throw a stone at her.”",
  "8": "Then he stooped down again and continued writing on the ground.",
  "9": "When they heard this, they left one by one, starting with the older men. Only he was left, with the woman in the center.",
  "10": "When Jesus stood up, he said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”",
  "11": "“No one, Lord,” she answered. “Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus. “Go, and from now on do not sin anymore.”",
  "12": "Jesus spoke to them again: “I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.”",
  "13": "So the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”",
  "14": "“Even if I testify about myself,” Jesus replied, “My testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I’m going. But you don’t know where I come from or where I’m going.",
  "15": "You judge by human standards. I judge no one.",
  "16": "And if I do judge, my judgment is true, because it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.",
  "17": "Even in your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.",
  "18": "I am the one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”",
  "19": "Then they asked him, “Where is your Father?” “You know neither me nor my Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew me, you would also know my Father.”",
  "20": "He spoke these words by the treasury, while teaching in the temple. But no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.",
  "21": "Then he said to them again, “I’m going away; you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I’m going, you cannot come.”",
  "22": "So the Jews said again, “He won’t kill himself, will he, since he says, ‘Where I’m going, you cannot come’?”",
  "23": "“You are from below,” he told them, “I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.",
  "24": "Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”",
  "25": "“Who are you?” they questioned. “Exactly what I’ve been telling you from the very beginning,” Jesus told them.",
  "26": "“I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the one who sent me is true, and what I have heard from him — these things I tell the world.”",
  "27": "They did not know he was speaking to them about the Father.",
  "28": "So Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own. But just as the Father taught me, I say these things.",
  "29": "The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.”",
  "30": "As he was saying these things, many believed in him.",
  "31": "Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you continue in my word, you really are my disciples.",
  "32": "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”",
  "33": "“We are descendants of Abraham,” they answered him, “and we have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?”",
  "34": "Jesus responded, “Truly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.",
  "35": "A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son does remain forever.",
  "36": "So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.",
  "37": "I know you are descendants of Abraham, but you are trying to kill me because my word has no place among you.",
  "38": "I speak what I have seen in the presence of the Father; so then, you do what you have heard from your father.”",
  "39": "“Our father is Abraham,” they replied. “If you were Abraham’s children,” Jesus told them, “you would do what Abraham did.",
  "40": "But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.",
  "41": "You’re doing what your father does.” “We weren’t born of sexual immorality,” they said. “We have one Father — God.”",
  "42": "Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and I am here. For I didn’t come on my own, but he sent me.",
  "43": "Why don’t you understand what I say? Because you cannot listen to my word.",
  "44": "You are of your father the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.",
  "45": "Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.",
  "46": "Who among you can convict me of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?",
  "47": "The one who is from God listens to God’s words. This is why you don’t listen, because you are not from God.”",
  "48": "The Jews responded to him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you’re a Samaritan and have a demon?”",
  "49": "“I do not have a demon,” Jesus answered. “On the contrary, I honor my Father and you dishonor me.",
  "50": "I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and judges.",
  "51": "Truly I tell you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”",
  "52": "Then the Jews said, “Now we know you have a demon. Abraham died and so did the prophets. You say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.’",
  "53": "Are you greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who do you claim to be?”",
  "54": "“If I glorify myself,” Jesus answered, “my glory is nothing. My Father — about whom you say, ‘He is our God’ — he is the one who glorifies me.",
  "55": "You do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say I don’t know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I keep his word.",
  "56": "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.”",
  "57": "The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham?”",
  "58": "Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.”",
  "59": "So they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple."
