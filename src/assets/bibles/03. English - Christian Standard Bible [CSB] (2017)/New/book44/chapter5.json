  "3": "“Ananias,” Peter asked, “why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds of the land?",
  "4": "Wasn’t it yours while you possessed it? And after it was sold, wasn’t it at your disposal? Why is it that you planned this thing in your heart? You have not lied to people but to God.”",
  "5": "When he heard these words, Ananias dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard.",
  "6": "The young men got up, wrapped his body, carried him out, and buried him.",

  "10": "Instantly she dropped dead at his feet. When the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.",

  "19": "But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail during the night, brought them out, and said,",
  "20": "“Go and stand in the temple, and tell the people all about this life.”",
  "21": "Hearing this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach. When the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin — the full council of the Israelites — and sent orders to the jail to have them brought.",
  "22": "But when the servants got there, they did not find them in the jail, so they returned and reported,",
  "23": "“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing in front of the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”",
  "24": "As the captain of the temple police and the chief priests heard these things, they were baffled about them, wondering what would come of this.",
  "25": "Someone came and reported to them, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people.”",
  "26": "Then the commander went with the servants and brought them in without force, because they were afraid the people might stone them.",
  "27": "After they brought them in, they had them stand before the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked,",

  "29": "Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.",
  "30": "The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had murdered by hanging him on a tree.",
  "31": "God exalted this man to his right hand as ruler and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.",
