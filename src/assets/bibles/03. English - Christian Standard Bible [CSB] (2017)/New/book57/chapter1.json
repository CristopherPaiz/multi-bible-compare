  "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dear friend and coworker,",
  "2": "to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home.",
  "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "4": "I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,",
  "5": "because I hear of your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus.",
  "6": "I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us for the glory of Christ.",
  "7": "For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
  "8": "For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right,",
  "9": "I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus,",

  "17": "So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me.",
  "18": "And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.",
  "19": "I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it — not to mention to you that you owe me even your very self.",
  "20": "Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
  "21": "Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.",
  "22": "Meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, since I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.",
  "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, and so do",
  "24": "Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers.",
