  "42": "“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.",

  "63": "and said, “Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’",
  "64": "So give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come, steal him, and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”",
  "65": "“You have a guard of soldiers,” Pilate told them. “Go and make it as secure as you know how.”",
