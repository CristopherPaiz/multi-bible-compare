  "1": "A pronouncement: The word of the LORD concerning Israel. A declaration of the LORD, who stretched out the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.",
  "2": "“Look, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering for the peoples who surround the city. The siege against Jerusalem will also involve Judah.",
  "3": "On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who try to lift it will injure themselves severely when all the nations of the earth gather against her.",
  "4": "On that day” — this is the LORD’s declaration — “I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah but strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.",
  "5": "Then each of the leaders of Judah will think to himself: The residents of Jerusalem are my strength through the LORD of Armies, their God.",

  "7": "The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of David’s house and the glory of Jerusalem’s residents may not be greater than that of Judah.",

  "12": "The land will mourn, every family by itself: the family of David’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan’s house by itself and their women by themselves;",
  "13": "the family of Levi’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself and their women by themselves;",
