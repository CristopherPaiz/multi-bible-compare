  "2": "and also against Hamath, which borders it, as well as Tyre and Sidon, though they are very shrewd.",
  "3": "Tyre has built herself a fortress; she has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.",

  "6": "A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.",
  "7": "I will remove the blood from their mouths and the abhorrent things from between their teeth. Then they too will become a remnant for our God; they will become like a clan in Judah and Ekron like the Jebusites.",

  "17": "How lovely and beautiful! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine, the young women."
