  "8": "Then Saul summoned all the troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.",
  "9": "When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod.”",
  "10": "Then David said, “LORD God of Israel, your servant has reliable information that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me.",
  "11": "Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? LORD God of Israel, please tell your servant.” The LORD answered, “He will come down.”",
  "12": "Then David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?” “They will,” the LORD responded.",

  "17": "saying, “Don’t be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. You yourself will be king over Israel, and I’ll be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows it is true.”",
  "18": "Then the two of them made a covenant in the LORD’s presence. Afterward, David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home.",
  "19": "Some Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “David is hiding among us in the strongholds in Horesh on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon.",
  "20": "Now, whenever the king wants to come down, let him come down. Our part will be to hand him over to the king.”",
  "21": "“May you be blessed by the LORD,” replied Saul, “for you have shown concern for me.",
  "22": "Go and check again. Investigate where he goes and who has seen him there; they tell me he is extremely cunning.",
  "23": "Investigate all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with accurate information, and I’ll go with you. If it turns out he really is in the region, I’ll search for him among all the clans of Judah.”",
  "24": "So they went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness near Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon,",
  "25": "and Saul and his men went to look for him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. Saul heard of this and pursued David there.",
  "26": "Saul went along one side of the mountain and David and his men went along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away from Saul, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.",
  "27": "Then a messenger came to Saul saying, “Come quickly, because the Philistines have raided the land!”",
  "28": "So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to engage the Philistines. Therefore, that place was named the Rock of Separation.",
