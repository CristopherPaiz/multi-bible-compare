  "6": "“Be very strong and continue obeying all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you do not turn from it to the right or left",

  "16": "If you break the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow in worship to them, the LORD’s anger will burn against you, and you will quickly disappear from this good land he has given you.”"
