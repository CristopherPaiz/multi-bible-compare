  "1": "The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The pronouncement. The man’s oration to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:",
  "2": "I am more stupid than any other person, and I lack a human’s ability to understand.",
  "3": "I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.",
  "4": "Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his hands? Who has bound up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son — if you know?",
  "5": "Every word of God is pure; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.",
  "6": "Don’t add to his words, or he will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar.",
  "7": "Two things I ask of you; don’t deny them to me before I die:",
  "8": "Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor wealth; feed me with the food I need.",
  "9": "Otherwise, I might have too much and deny you, saying, “Who is the LORD?” or I might have nothing and steal, profaning the name of my God.",
  "10": "Don’t slander a servant to his master or he will curse you, and you will become guilty.",
  "11": "There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother.",
  "12": "There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filth.",
  "13": "There is a generation — how haughty its eyes and pretentious its looks.",
  "14": "There is a generation whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, devouring the oppressed from the land and the needy from among mankind.",
  "15": "The leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!” Three things are never satisfied; four never say, “Enough!”:",
  "16": "Sheol; a childless womb; earth, which is never satisfied with water; and fire, which never says, “Enough!”",
  "17": "As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.",
  "18": "Three things are too wondrous for me; four I can’t understand:",
  "19": "the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.",
  "20": "This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, “I’ve done nothing wrong.”",
  "21": "The earth trembles under three things; it cannot bear up under four:",
  "22": "a servant when he becomes king, a fool when he is stuffed with food,",
  "23": "an unloved woman when she marries, and a servant girl when she ousts her queen.",
  "24": "Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:",
  "25": "ants are not a strong people, yet they store up their food in the summer;",
  "26": "hyraxes are not a mighty people, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;",
  "27": "locusts have no king, yet all of them march in ranks;",
  "28": "a lizard can be caught in your hands, yet it lives in kings’ palaces.",
  "29": "Three things are stately in their stride; four are stately in their walk:",
  "30": "a lion, which is mightiest among beasts and doesn’t retreat before anything;",
  "31": "a strutting rooster; a goat; and a king at the head of his army.",
  "32": "If you have been foolish by exalting yourself or if you’ve been scheming, put your hand over your mouth.",
  "33": "For the churning of milk produces butter, and twisting a nose draws blood, and stirring up anger produces strife."
