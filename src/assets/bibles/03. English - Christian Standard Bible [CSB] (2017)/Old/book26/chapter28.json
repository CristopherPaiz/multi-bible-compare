  "4": "By your wisdom and understanding you have acquired wealth for yourself. You have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries.",
  "5": "By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has become proud because of your wealth.",
  "6": "“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you regard your heart as that of a god,",

  "8": "They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the sea.",

  "13": "You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone covered you: carnelian, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold; they were prepared on the day you were created.",
  "14": "You were an anointed guardian cherub, for I had appointed you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.",
  "15": "From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways until wickedness was found in you.",
  "16": "Through the abundance of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I expelled you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and banished you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.",
  "17": "Your heart became proud because of your beauty; For the sake of your splendor you corrupted your wisdom. So I threw you down to the ground; I made you a spectacle before kings.",
  "18": "You profaned your sanctuaries by the magnitude of your iniquities in your dishonest trade. So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of everyone watching you.",
  "19": "All those who know you among the peoples are appalled at you. You have become an object of horror and will never exist again.’”",
  "20": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "21": "“Son of man, face Sidon and prophesy against it.",
  "22": "You are to say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: Look! I am against you, Sidon, and I will display my glory within you. They will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate my holiness through her.",
  "23": "I will send a plague against her and bloodshed in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.",
  "24": "“‘The house of Israel will no longer be hurt by prickly briers or painful thorns from all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.",
  "25": "“‘This is what the Lord GOD says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are scattered, I will demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of the nations, and they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.",
  "26": "They will live there securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute judgments against all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.’”"
