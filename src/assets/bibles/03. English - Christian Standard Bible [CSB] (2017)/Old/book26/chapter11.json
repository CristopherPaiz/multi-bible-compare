  "1": "The Spirit then lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the LORD’s house, which faces east, and at the gate’s entrance were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.",
  "2": "The LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city.",
  "3": "They are saying, ‘Isn’t the time near to build houses? The city is the pot, and we are the meat.’",
  "4": "Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!”",
  "5": "Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and he told me, “You are to say, ‘This is what the LORD says: That is what you are thinking, house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your mind.",
  "6": "You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them.",
  "7": "“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: The slain you have put within it are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will take you out of it.",
  "8": "You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.",
  "9": "I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute judgments against you.",
  "10": "You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.",
  "11": "The city will not be a pot for you, and you will not be the meat within it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,",
  "12": "so you will know that I am the LORD, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not practiced. Instead, you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.’”",
  "13": "Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out loudly, “Oh, Lord GOD! You are bringing the remnant of Israel to an end!”",
  "14": "The word of the LORD came to me again:",
  "15": "“Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem your property, along with the entire house of Israel — all of them — are those to whom the residents of Jerusalem have said, ‘You are far from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.’",
  "16": "“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’",
  "17": "“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’",
  "18": "“When they arrive there, they will remove all its abhorrent acts and detestable practices from it.",
  "19": "I will give them integrity of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,",
  "20": "so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and practice them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.",
  "21": "But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for abhorrent acts and detestable practices, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.",
  "22": "Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.",
  "23": "The glory of the LORD rose up from within the city and stopped on the mountain east of the city.",
  "24": "The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea and to the exiles in a vision from the Spirit of God. After the vision I had seen left me,",
  "25": "I spoke to the exiles about all the things the LORD had shown me."
