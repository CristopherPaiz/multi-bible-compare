  "7": "The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive story, for the structure surrounding the temple went up by stages. This was the reason for the temple’s broadness as it rose. And so, one would go up from the lowest story to the highest by means of the middle one.",

  "14": "The width of the front of the temple along with the temple yard to the east was 175 feet.",
  "15": "Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple yard to the west, with its galleries on each side; it was 175 feet. The interior of the great hall and the porticoes of the court —",
  "16": "the thresholds, the beveled windows, and the balconies all around with their three levels opposite the threshold — were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were paneled from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),",
  "17": "reaching to the top of the entrance, and as far as the inner temple and on the outside. On every wall all around, on the inside and outside, was a pattern",
  "18": "carved with cherubim and palm trees. There was a palm tree between each pair of cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:",

  "23": "The great hall and the sanctuary each had a double door,",
  "24": "and each of the doors had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other.",
