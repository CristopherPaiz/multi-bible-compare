  "1": "The pronouncement concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.",
  "2": "The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is fierce in wrath. The LORD takes vengeance against his foes; he is furious with his enemies.",
  "3": "The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will never leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath his feet.",
  "4": "He rebukes the sea and dries it up, and he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; even the flower of Lebanon withers.",
  "5": "The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt; the earth trembles at his presence — the world and all who live in it.",
  "6": "Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before him.",
  "7": "The LORD is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; he cares for those who take refuge in him.",
  "8": "But he will completely destroy Nineveh with an overwhelming flood, and he will chase his enemies into darkness.",
  "9": "Whatever you plot against the LORD, he will bring it to complete destruction; oppression will not rise up a second time.",
  "10": "For they will be consumed like entangled thorns, like the drink of a drunkard and like straw that is fully dry.",
  "11": "One has gone out from you, who plots evil against the LORD, and is a wicked counselor.",
  "12": "This is what the LORD says: Though they are strong and numerous, they will still be mowed down, and he will pass away. Though I have punished you, I will punish you no longer.",
  "13": "For I will now break off his yoke from you and tear off your shackles.",
  "14": "The LORD has issued an order concerning you: There will be no offspring to carry on your name. I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.",
  "15": "Look to the mountains — the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace. Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out."
