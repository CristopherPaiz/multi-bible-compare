  "5": "This is so the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they have been offering in the open country. They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting and offer them as fellowship sacrifices to the LORD.",
  "6": "The priest will then splatter the blood on the LORD’s altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.",

  "14": "Since the life of every creature is its blood, I have told the Israelites: You are not to eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off.",
  "15": "“Every person, whether the native or the resident alien, who eats an animal that died a natural death or was mauled by wild beasts is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening; then he will be clean.",
  "16": "But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself, he will bear his iniquity.”"
