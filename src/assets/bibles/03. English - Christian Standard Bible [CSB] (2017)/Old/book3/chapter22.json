  "4": "No man of Aaron’s descendants who has a skin disease or a discharge is to eat from the holy offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything made unclean by a dead person or by a man who has an emission of semen,",

  "29": "When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.",
  "30": "It is to be eaten on the same day. Do not let any of it remain until morning; I am the LORD.",
