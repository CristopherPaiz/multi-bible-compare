  "6": "She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true.",

  "18": "The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with fine gold.",

  "20": "Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom.",
  "21": "All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, since it was considered as nothing in Solomon’s time,",
