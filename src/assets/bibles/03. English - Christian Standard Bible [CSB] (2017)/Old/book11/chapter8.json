  "16": "“Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city to build a temple in among any of the tribes of Israel, so that my name would be there. But I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.”",
  "17": "My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "18": "But the LORD said to my father David, “Since your heart was set on building a temple for my name, you have done well to have this desire.",
  "19": "Yet you are not the one to build it; instead, your son, your own offspring, will build it for my name.”",

  "31": "When a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before your altar in this temple,",

  "38": "every prayer or petition that any person or that all your people Israel may have — they each know their own affliction  — as they spread out their hands toward this temple,",
  "39": "may you hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and may you forgive, act, and give to everyone according to all their ways, since you know each heart, for you alone know every human heart,",
  "40": "so that they may fear you all the days they live on the land you gave our ancestors.",
  "41": "Even for the foreigner who is not of your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name —",

  "52": "May your eyes be open to your servant’s petition and to the petition of your people Israel, listening to them whenever they call to you.",
  "53": "For you, Lord GOD, have set them apart as your inheritance from all peoples of the earth, as you spoke through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt.",

  "55": "and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel with a loud voice:",
  "56": "“Blessed be the LORD! He has given rest to his people Israel according to all he has said. Not one of all the good promises he made through his servant Moses has failed.",
  "57": "May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our ancestors. May he not abandon us or leave us",

  "63": "Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep and goats. In this manner the king and all the Israelites dedicated the LORD’s temple.",
  "64": "On the same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORD’s temple because that was where he offered the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the fellowship offerings since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to accommodate the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.",
  "65": "Solomon and all Israel with him — a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt  — observed the festival at that time in the presence of the LORD our God, seven days, and seven more days — fourteen days.",
  "66": "On the fifteenth day he sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went to their homes rejoicing and with happy hearts for all the goodness that the LORD had done for his servant David and for his people Israel."
