  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "Pay close attention to my words; let this be the consolation you offer.",
  "3": "Bear with me while I speak; then after I have spoken, you may continue mocking.",
  "4": "As for me, is my complaint against a human being? Then why shouldn’t I be impatient?",
  "5": "Look at me and shudder; put your hand over your mouth.",
  "6": "When I think about it, I am terrified and my body trembles in horror.",
  "7": "Why do the wicked continue to live, growing old and becoming powerful?",
  "8": "Their children are established while they are still alive, and their descendants, before their eyes.",
  "9": "Their homes are secure and free of fear; no rod from God strikes them.",
  "10": "Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry.",
  "11": "They let their little ones run around like lambs; their children skip about,",
  "12": "singing to the tambourine and lyre and rejoicing at the sound of the flute.",
  "13": "They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.",
  "14": "Yet they say to God, “Leave us alone! We don’t want to know your ways.",
  "15": "Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him, and what will we gain by pleading with him?”",
  "16": "But their prosperity is not of their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!",
  "17": "How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come on them? Does he apportion destruction in his anger?",
  "18": "Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff a storm sweeps away?",
  "19": "God reserves a person’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the person himself, so that he may know it.",
  "20": "Let his own eyes see his demise; let him drink from the Almighty’s wrath!",
  "21": "For what does he care about his family once he is dead, when the number of his months has run out?",
  "22": "Can anyone teach God knowledge, since he judges the exalted ones?",
  "23": "One person dies in excellent health, completely secure and at ease.",
  "24": "His body is well fed, and his bones are full of marrow.",
  "25": "Yet another person dies with a bitter soul, having never tasted prosperity.",
  "26": "But they both lie in the dust, and worms cover them.",
  "27": "I know your thoughts very well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.",
  "28": "For you say, “Where now is the nobleman’s house?” and “Where are the tents the wicked lived in?”",
  "29": "Have you never consulted those who travel the roads? Don’t you accept their reports?",
  "30": "Indeed, the evil person is spared from the day of disaster, rescued from the day of wrath.",
  "31": "Who would denounce his behavior to his face? Who would repay him for what he has done?",
  "32": "He is carried to the grave, and someone keeps watch over his tomb.",
  "33": "The dirt on his grave is sweet to him. Everyone follows behind him, and those who go before him are without number.",
  "34": "So how can you offer me such futile comfort? Your answers are deceptive."
