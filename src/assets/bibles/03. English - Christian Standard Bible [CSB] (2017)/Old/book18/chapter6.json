  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "If only my grief could be weighed and my devastation placed with it on the scales.",
  "3": "For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas! That is why my words are rash.",
  "4": "Surely the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks their poison. God’s terrors are arrayed against me.",
  "5": "Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass or an ox low over its fodder?",
  "6": "Is bland food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in an egg white?",
  "7": "I refuse to touch them; they are like contaminated food.",
  "8": "If only my request would be granted and God would provide what I hope for:",
  "9": "that he would decide to crush me, to unleash his power and cut me off!",
  "10": "It would still bring me comfort, and I would leap for joy in unrelenting pain that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "What strength do I have, that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?",
  "12": "Is my strength that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?",
  "13": "Since I cannot help myself, the hope for success has been banished from me.",
  "14": "A despairing man should receive loyalty from his friends, even if he abandons the fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "My brothers are as treacherous as a wadi, as seasonal streams that overflow",
  "16": "and become darkened because of ice, and the snow melts into them.",
  "17": "The wadis evaporate in warm weather; they disappear from their channels in hot weather.",
  "18": "Caravans turn away from their routes, go up into the desert, and perish.",
  "19": "The caravans of Tema look for these streams. The traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.",
  "20": "They are ashamed because they had been confident of finding water. When they arrive there, they are disappointed.",
  "21": "So this is what you have now become to me. When you see something dreadful, you are afraid.",
  "22": "Have I ever said: “Give me something” or “Pay a bribe for me from your wealth”",
  "23": "or “Deliver me from the enemy’s hand” or “Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless”?",
  "24": "Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand what I did wrong.",
  "25": "How painful honest words can be! But what does your rebuke prove?",
  "26": "Do you think that you can disprove my words or that a despairing man’s words are mere wind?",
  "27": "No doubt you would cast lots for a fatherless child and negotiate a price to sell your friend.",
  "28": "But now, please look at me; I will not lie to your face.",
  "29": "Reconsider; don’t be unjust. Reconsider; my righteousness is still the issue.",
  "30": "Is there injustice on my tongue or can my palate not taste disaster?"
