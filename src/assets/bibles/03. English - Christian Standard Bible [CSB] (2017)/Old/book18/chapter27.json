  "1": "Job continued his discourse, saying:",

  "4": "my lips will not speak unjustly, and my tongue will not utter deceit.",
  "5": "I will never affirm that you are right. I will maintain my integrity until I die.",
  "6": "I will cling to my righteousness and never let it go. My conscience will not accuse me as long as I live!",
  "7": "May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.",
  "8": "For what hope does the godless person have when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?",

  "21": "An east wind picks him up, and he is gone; it carries him away from his place.",
  "22": "It blasts at him without mercy, while he flees desperately from its force.",
  "23": "It claps its hands at him and scoffs at him from its place."
