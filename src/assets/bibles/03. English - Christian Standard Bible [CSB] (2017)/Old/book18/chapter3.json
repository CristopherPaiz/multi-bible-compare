  "1": "After this, Job began to speak and cursed the day he was born.",
  "2": "He said:",
  "3": "May the day I was born perish, and the night that said, “A boy is conceived.”",
  "4": "If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above not care about it, or light shine on it.",
  "5": "May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it. May what darkens the day terrify it.",
  "6": "If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year or be listed in the calendar.",
  "7": "Yes, may that night be barren; may no joyful shout be heard in it.",
  "8": "Let those who curse days condemn it, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.",
  "9": "May its morning stars grow dark. May it wait for daylight but have none; may it not see the breaking of dawn.",

  "16": "Or why was I not hidden like a miscarried child, like infants who never see daylight?",
  "17": "There the wicked cease to make trouble, and there the weary find rest.",
  "18": "The captives are completely at rest; they do not hear a taskmaster’s voice.",
  "19": "Both small and great are there, and the slave is set free from his master.",
  "20": "Why is light given to one burdened with grief, and life to those whose existence is bitter,",
  "21": "who wait for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasure,",
  "22": "who are filled with much joy and are glad when they reach the grave?",
  "23": "Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has hedged in?",
  "24": "I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.",
  "25": "For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has happened to me.",
  "26": "I cannot relax or be calm; I have no rest, for turmoil has come."
