  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "Yes, I know what you’ve said is true, but how can a person be justified before God?",
  "3": "If one wanted to take him to court, he could not answer God once in a thousand times.",
  "4": "God is wise and all-powerful. Who has opposed him and come out unharmed?",
  "5": "He removes mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his anger.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth from its place so that its pillars tremble.",
  "7": "He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars.",
  "8": "He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.",
  "9": "He makes the stars: the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky.",
  "10": "He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.",
  "11": "If he passed by me, I wouldn’t see him; if he went by, I wouldn’t recognize him.",
  "12": "If he snatches something, who can stop him? Who can ask him, “What are you doing?”",
  "13": "God does not hold back his anger; Rahab’s assistants cringe in fear beneath him!",
  "14": "How then can I answer him or choose my arguments against him?",
  "15": "Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.",
  "16": "If I summoned him and he answered me, I do not believe he would pay attention to what I said.",
  "17": "He batters me with a whirlwind and multiplies my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "He doesn’t let me catch my breath but fills me with bitter experiences.",
  "19": "If it is a matter of strength, look, he is the powerful one! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?",
  "20": "Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty.",
  "21": "Though I am blameless, I no longer care about myself; I renounce my life.",
  "22": "It is all the same. Therefore I say, “He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.”",
  "23": "When catastrophe brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "The earth is handed over to the wicked; he blindfolds its judges. If it isn’t he, then who is it?",
  "25": "My days fly by faster than a runner; they flee without seeing any good.",
  "26": "They sweep by like boats made of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.",
  "27": "If I said, “I will forget my complaint, change my expression, and smile,”",
  "28": "I would still live in terror of all my pains. I know you will not acquit me.",
  "29": "Since I will be found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?",
  "30": "If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,",
  "31": "then you dip me in a pit of mud, and my own clothes despise me!",
  "32": "For he is not a man like me, that I can answer him, that we can take each other to court.",
  "33": "There is no mediator between us, to lay his hand on both of us.",
  "34": "Let him take his rod away from me so his terror will no longer frighten me.",
  "35": "Then I would speak and not fear him. But that is not the case; I am on my own."
