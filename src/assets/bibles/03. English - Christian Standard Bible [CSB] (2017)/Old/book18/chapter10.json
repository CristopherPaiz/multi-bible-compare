  "1": "I am disgusted with my life. I will give vent to my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "2": "I will say to God, “Do not declare me guilty! Let me know why you prosecute me.",
  "3": "Is it good for you to oppress, to reject the work of your hands, and favor the plans of the wicked?",

  "19": "I wish I had never existed but had been carried from the womb to the grave.",
  "20": "Are my days not few? Stop it! Leave me alone, so that I can smile a little",
  "21": "before I go to a land of darkness and gloom, never to return.",
  "22": "It is a land of blackness like the deepest darkness, gloomy and chaotic, where even the light is like the darkness.”"
