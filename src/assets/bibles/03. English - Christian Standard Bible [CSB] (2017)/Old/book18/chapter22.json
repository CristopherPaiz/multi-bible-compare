  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:",
  "2": "Can a man be of any use to God? Can even a wise man be of use to him?",
  "3": "Does it delight the Almighty if you are righteous? Does he profit if you perfect your behavior?",
  "4": "Does he correct you and take you to court because of your piety?",
  "5": "Isn’t your wickedness abundant and aren’t your iniquities endless?",
  "6": "For you took collateral from your brothers without cause, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.",
  "7": "You gave no water to the thirsty and withheld food from the famished,",
  "8": "while the land belonged to a powerful man and an influential man lived on it.",
  "9": "You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.",

  "21": "Come to terms with God and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.",
  "22": "Receive instruction from his mouth, and place his sayings in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will be renewed. If you banish injustice from your tent",
  "24": "and consign your gold to the dust, the gold of Ophir to the stones in the wadis,",
  "25": "the Almighty will be your gold and your finest silver.",
  "26": "Then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.",
  "28": "When you make a decision, it will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.",
  "29": "When others are humiliated and you say, “Lift them up,” God will save the humble.",
