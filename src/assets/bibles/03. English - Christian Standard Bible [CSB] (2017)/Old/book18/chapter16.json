  "18": "Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help find no resting place.",
  "19": "Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is in the heights!",
  "20": "My friends scoff at me as I weep before God.",
  "21": "I wish that someone might argue for a man with God just as anyone would for a friend.",
