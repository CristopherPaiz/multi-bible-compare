  "6": "Though his arrogance reaches heaven, and his head touches the clouds,",
  "7": "he will vanish forever like his own dung. Those who know him will ask, “Where is he?”",
  "8": "He will fly away like a dream and never be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.",

  "22": "At the height of his success distress will come to him; the full weight of misery will crush him.",
