  "5": "You will plant vineyards again on the mountains of Samaria; the planters will plant and will enjoy the fruit.",
  "6": "For there will be a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim, “Come, let’s go up to Zion, to the LORD our God!”",
  "7": "For this is what the LORD says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations! Proclaim, praise, and say, “LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel!”",
  "8": "Watch! I am going to bring them from the northern land. I will gather them from remote regions of the earth  — the blind and the lame will be with them, along with those who are pregnant and those about to give birth. They will return here as a great assembly!",
  "9": "They will come weeping, but I will bring them back with consolation. I will lead them to wadis filled with water, by a smooth way where they will not stumble, for I am Israel’s Father, and Ephraim is my firstborn.",
  "10": "Nations, hear the word of the LORD, and tell it among the far off coasts and islands! Say, “The one who scattered Israel will gather him. He will watch over him as a shepherd guards his flock,",

  "12": "They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy because of the LORD’s goodness, because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and because of the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like an irrigated garden, and they will no longer grow weak from hunger.",

  "15": "This is what the LORD says: A voice was heard in Ramah, a lament with bitter weeping — Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children because they are no more.",
  "16": "This is what the LORD says: Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for the reward for your work will come — this is the LORD’s declaration — and your children will return from the enemy’s land.",
  "17": "There is hope for your future  — this is the LORD’s declaration — and your children will return to their own territory.",

  "20": "Isn’t Ephraim a precious son to me, a delightful child? Whenever I speak against him, I certainly still think about him. Therefore, my inner being yearns for him; I will truly have compassion on him. This is the LORD’s declaration.",
  "21": "Set up road markers for yourself; establish signposts! Keep the highway in mind, the way you have traveled. Return, Virgin Israel! Return to these cities of yours.",

  "28": "Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear them down, to demolish and to destroy, and to cause disaster, so will I watch over them to build and to plant them”  — this is the LORD’s declaration.",
  "29": "“In those days, it will never again be said, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’",
  "30": "Rather, each will die for his own iniquity. Anyone who eats sour grapes — his own teeth will be set on edge.",
  "31": "“Look, the days are coming”  — this is the LORD’s declaration — “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.",
  "32": "This one will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt — my covenant that they broke even though I am their master”  — the LORD’s declaration.",
  "33": "“Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days” — the LORD’s declaration. “I will put my teaching within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.",
  "34": "No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them”  — this is the LORD’s declaration. “For I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin.",

  "39": "A measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.",
  "40": "The whole valley — the corpses, the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east — will be holy to the LORD. It will never be uprooted or demolished again.”"
