  "1": "Then the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before me, my compassions would not reach out to these people. Send them from my presence, and let them go.",
  "2": "If they ask you, ‘Where will we go? ’ tell them: This is what the LORD says: Those destined for death, to death; those destined for the sword, to the sword. Those destined for famine, to famine; those destined for captivity, to captivity.",
  "3": "“I will ordain four kinds of judgment for them” — this is the LORD’s declaration — “the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land to devour and destroy.",
  "4": "I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.",
  "5": "Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will show sympathy toward you? Who will turn aside to ask about your well-being?",
  "6": "You have left me.” This is the LORD’s declaration. “You have turned your back, so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you. I am tired of showing compassion.",
  "7": "I scattered them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I made them childless; I destroyed my people. They would not turn from their ways.",
  "8": "I made their widows more numerous than the sand of the seas. I brought a destroyer at noon against the mother of young men. I suddenly released on her agitation and terrors.",
  "9": "The mother of seven grew faint; she breathed her last breath. Her sun set while it was still day; she was ashamed and humiliated. The rest of them I will give over to the sword in the presence of their enemies.” This is the LORD’s declaration.",
  "10": "Woe is me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man who incites dispute and conflict in all the land. I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me.",
  "11": "The LORD said: Haven’t I set you loose for your good? Haven’t I punished you in a time of trouble, in a time of distress with the enemy?",
  "12": "Can anyone smash iron, iron from the north, or bronze?",
  "13": "I will give up your wealth and your treasures as plunder, without cost, for all your sins in all your borders.",
  "14": "Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.",
  "15": "You know, LORD; remember me and take note of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In your patience, don’t take me away. Know that I suffer disgrace for your honor.",
  "16": "Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the joy of my heart, for I bear your name, LORD God of Armies.",
  "17": "I never sat with the band of revelers, and I did not celebrate with them. Because your hand was on me, I sat alone, for you filled me with indignation.",
  "18": "Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You truly have become like a mirage to me — water that is not reliable.",
  "19": "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: If you return, I will take you back; you will stand in my presence. And if you speak noble words, rather than worthless ones, you will be my spokesman. It is they who must return to you; you must not return to them.",
  "20": "Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and rescue you. This is the LORD’s declaration.",
  "21": "I will rescue you from the power of evil people and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless."
