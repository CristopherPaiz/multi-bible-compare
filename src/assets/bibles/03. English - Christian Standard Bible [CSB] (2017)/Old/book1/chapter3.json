  "13": "So the LORD God asked the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”",
  "14": "So the LORD God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal. You will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.",
  "15": "I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.",
