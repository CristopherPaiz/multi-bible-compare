  "2": "The fear and terror of you will be in every living creature on the earth, every bird of the sky, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are placed under your authority.",
  "3": "Every creature that lives and moves will be food for you; as I gave the green plants, I have given you everything.",
  "4": "However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood in it.",
  "5": "And I will require a penalty for your lifeblood; I will require it from any animal and from any human; if someone murders a fellow human, I will require that person’s life.",
  "6": "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans his blood will be shed, for God made humans in his image.",

  "14": "Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the bow appears in the clouds,",
  "15": "I will remember my covenant between me and you and all the living creatures: water will never again become a flood to destroy every creature.",
  "16": "The bow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the permanent covenant between God and all the living creatures on earth.”",
  "17": "God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and every creature on earth.”",

  "21": "He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent.",
  "22": "Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.",
  "23": "Then Shem and Japheth took a cloak and placed it over both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father naked.",
  "24": "When Noah awoke from his drinking and learned what his youngest son had done to him,",
  "25": "he said: Canaan is cursed. He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers.",
  "26": "He also said: Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; Let Canaan be Shem’s slave.",
