  "1": "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, “I am God Almighty. Live in my presence and be blameless.",
  "2": "I will set up my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you greatly.”",
  "3": "Then Abram fell facedown and God spoke with him:",
  "4": "“As for me, here is my covenant with you: You will become the father of many nations.",
  "5": "Your name will no longer be Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I will make you the father of many nations.",
  "6": "I will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you.",
  "7": "I will confirm my covenant that is between me and you and your future offspring throughout their generations. It is a permanent covenant to be your God and the God of your offspring after you.",
  "8": "And to you and your future offspring I will give the land where you are residing — all the land of Canaan — as a permanent possession, and I will be their God.”",
  "9": "God also said to Abraham, “As for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep my covenant.",
  "10": "This is my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you, which you are to keep: Every one of your males must be circumcised.",
  "11": "You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.",
  "12": "Throughout your generations, every male among you is to be circumcised at eight days old — every male born in your household or purchased from any foreigner and not your offspring.",
  "13": "Whether born in your household or purchased, he must be circumcised. My covenant will be marked in your flesh as a permanent covenant.",
  "14": "If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”",
  "15": "God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai, for Sarah will be her name.",
  "16": "I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will produce nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”",
  "17": "Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a hundred-year-old man? Can Sarah, a ninety-year-old woman, give birth?”",
  "18": "So Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael were acceptable to you!”",
  "19": "But God said, “No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm my covenant with him as a permanent covenant for his future offspring.",
  "20": "As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will certainly bless him; I will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly. He will father twelve tribal leaders, and I will make him into a great nation.",
  "21": "But I will confirm my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”",
  "22": "When he finished talking with him, God withdrew from Abraham.",
  "23": "So Abraham took his son Ishmael and those born in his household or purchased — every male among the members of Abraham’s household — and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, just as God had said to him.",
  "24": "Abraham was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised,",
  "25": "and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.",
  "26": "On that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.",
  "27": "And all the men of his household — whether born in his household or purchased from a foreigner — were circumcised with him."
