  "1": "The Israelites again did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines forty years.",

  "3": "The angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are unable to conceive and have no children, but you will conceive and give birth to a son.",
  "4": "Now please be careful not to drink wine or beer, or to eat anything unclean;",
  "5": "for indeed, you will conceive and give birth to a son. You must never cut his hair, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth, and he will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines.”",
  "6": "Then the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. He looked like the awe-inspiring angel of God. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name.",
  "7": "He said to me, ‘You will conceive and give birth to a son. Therefore, do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day of his death.’”",
  "8": "Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, “Please, Lord, let the man of God you sent come again to us and teach us what we should do for the boy who will be born.”",
  "9": "God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman. She was sitting in the field, and her husband Manoah was not with her.",

  "13": "The angel of the LORD answered Manoah, “Your wife needs to do everything I told her.",
  "14": "She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine or drink wine or beer. And she must not eat anything unclean. Your wife must do everything I have commanded her.”",
  "15": "“Please stay here,” Manoah told him, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.”",
  "16": "The angel of the LORD said to him, “If I stay, I won’t eat your food. But if you want to prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” (Manoah did not know he was the angel of the LORD.)",
  "17": "Then Manoah said to him, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your words come true?”",
  "18": "“Why do you ask my name,” the angel of the LORD asked him, “since it is beyond understanding.”",
  "19": "Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD, who did something miraculous while Manoah and his wife were watching.",
  "20": "When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD went up in its flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown on the ground.",

  "25": "Then the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in the Camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
