  "1": "Woe to the city that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressive city!",

  "3": "The princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the night, which leave nothing for the morning.",
  "4": "Her prophets are reckless  — treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to instruction.",
  "5": "The righteous LORD is in her; he does no wrong. He applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn, yet the one who does wrong knows no shame.",
  "6": "I have cut off nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have laid waste their streets, with no one to pass through. Their cities lie devastated, without a person, without an inhabitant.",
  "7": "I thought: You will certainly fear me and accept correction. Then her dwelling place would not be cut off based on all that I had allocated to her. However, they became more corrupt in all their actions.",
  "8": "Therefore, wait for me  — this is the LORD’s declaration — until the day I rise up for plunder. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, in order to pour out my indignation on them, all my burning anger; for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy.",
  "9": "For I will then restore pure speech to the peoples so that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with a single purpose.",
  "10": "From beyond the rivers of Cush my supplicants, my dispersed people, will bring an offering to me.",
  "11": "On that day you will not be put to shame because of everything you have done in rebelling against me. For then I will remove from among you your jubilant, arrogant people, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.",
  "12": "I will leave a meek and humble people among you, and they will take refuge in the name of the LORD.",
  "13": "The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will pasture and lie down, with nothing to make them afraid.",
  "14": "Sing for joy, Daughter Zion; shout loudly, Israel! Be glad and celebrate with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!",
  "15": "The LORD has removed your punishment; he has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the LORD, is among you; you need no longer fear harm.",
  "16": "On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, do not let your hands grow weak.",
  "17": "The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing.”",
  "18": "I will gather those who have been driven from the appointed festivals; they will be a tribute from you and a reproach on her.",
  "19": "Yes, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcasts; I will make those who were disgraced throughout the earth receive praise and fame.",
  "20": "At that time I will bring you back, yes, at the time I will gather you. I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes. The LORD has spoken."
