  "3": "Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.",
  "4": "Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes like pools in Heshbon by Bath-rabbim’s gate. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.",
  "5": "Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple cloth — a king could be held captive in your tresses.",
  "6": "How beautiful you are and how pleasant, my love, with such delights!",
  "7": "Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit.",
  "8": "I said, “I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, and the fragrance of your breath like apricots.",

  "13": "The mandrakes give off a fragrance, and at our doors is every delicacy, both new and old. I have treasured them up for you, my love."
