  "3": "Then a warrior king will arise; he will rule a vast realm and do whatever he wants.",
  "4": "But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven, but not to his descendants; it will not be the same kingdom that he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and will go to others besides them.",

  "25": "“With a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will prepare for battle with an extremely large and powerful army, but he will not succeed, because plots will be made against him.",

  "36": "“Then the king will do whatever he wants. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and he will say outrageous things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, because what has been decreed will be accomplished.",
  "37": "He will not show regard for the gods of his fathers, the god desired by women, or for any other god, because he will magnify himself above all.",
  "38": "Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses — a god his fathers did not know — with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches.",
