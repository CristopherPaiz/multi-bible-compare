  "1": "Who is this coming from Edom in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah — this one who is splendid in his apparel, striding in his formidable might? It is I, proclaiming vindication, powerful to save.",
  "2": "Why are your clothes red, and your garments like one who treads a winepress?",
  "3": "I trampled the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with me. I trampled them in my anger and ground them underfoot in my fury; their blood spattered my garments, and all my clothes were stained.",
  "4": "For I planned the day of vengeance, and the year of my redemption came.",
  "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was amazed that no one assisted; so my arm accomplished victory for me, and my wrath assisted me.",
  "6": "I crushed nations in my anger; I made them drunk with my wrath and poured out their blood on the ground.",
  "7": "I will make known the LORD’s faithful love and the LORD’s praiseworthy acts, because of all the LORD has done for us — even the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, which he did for them based on his compassion and the abundance of his faithful love.",
  "8": "He said, “They are indeed my people, children who will not be disloyal,” and he became their Savior.",
  "9": "In all their suffering, he suffered, and the angel of his presence saved them. He redeemed them because of his love and compassion; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of the past.",
  "10": "But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he became their enemy and fought against them.",
  "11": "Then he remembered the days of the past, the days of Moses and his people. Where is he who brought them out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among the flock?",
  "12": "He made his glorious strength available at the right hand of Moses, divided the water before them to make an eternal name for himself,",
  "13": "and led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble.",
  "14": "Like cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. You led your people this way to make a glorious name for yourself.",
  "15": "Look down from heaven and see from your lofty home — holy and beautiful. Where is your zeal and your might? Your yearning and your compassion are withheld from me.",
  "16": "Yet you are our Father, even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesn’t recognize us. You, LORD, are our Father; your name is Our Redeemer from Ancient Times.",
  "17": "Why, LORD, do you make us stray from your ways? You harden our hearts so we do not fear you. Return, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.",
  "18": "Your holy people had a possession for a little while, but our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.",
  "19": "We have become like those you never ruled, like those who did not bear your name."
