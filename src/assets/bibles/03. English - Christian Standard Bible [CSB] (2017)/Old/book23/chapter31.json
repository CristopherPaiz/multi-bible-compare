  "1": "Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and who depend on horses! They trust in the abundance of chariots and in the large number of horsemen. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel and they do not seek the LORD.",
  "2": "But he also is wise and brings disaster. He does not go back on what he says; he will rise up against the house of the wicked and against the allies of evildoers.",
  "3": "Egyptians are men, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD raises his hand to strike, the helper will stumble and the one who is helped will fall; both will perish together.",
  "4": "For this is what the LORD said to me: As a lion or young lion growls over its prey when a band of shepherds is called out against it, and is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their noise, so the LORD of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.",
  "5": "Like hovering birds, so the LORD of Armies will protect Jerusalem  — by protecting it, he will rescue it, by sparing it, he will deliver it.",
  "6": "Return to the one the Israelites have greatly rebelled against.",
  "7": "For on that day, every one of you will reject the silver and gold idols that your own hands have sinfully made.",
  "8": "Then Assyria will fall, but not by human sword; a sword will devour him, but not one made by man. He will flee from the sword; his young men will be put to forced labor.",
  "9": "His rock will pass away because of fear, and his officers will be afraid because of the signal flag. This is the LORD’s declaration — whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem."
