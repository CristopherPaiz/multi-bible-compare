  "3": "I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz,",

  "5": "The LORD spoke to me again:",
  "6": "Because these people rejected the slowly flowing water of Shiloah and rejoiced with Rezin and the son of Remaliah,",
  "7": "the Lord will certainly bring against them the mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River — the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its channels and spill over all its banks.",
