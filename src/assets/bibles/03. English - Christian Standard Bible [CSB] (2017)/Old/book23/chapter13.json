  "1": "A pronouncement concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:",
  "2": "Lift up a banner on a barren mountain. Call out to them. Signal with your hand, and they will go through the gates of the nobles.",
  "3": "I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my warriors, who celebrate my triumph, to execute my wrath.",
  "4": "Listen, a commotion on the mountains, like that of a mighty people! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations being gathered together! The LORD of Armies is mobilizing an army for war.",
  "5": "They are coming from a distant land, from the farthest horizon — the LORD and the weapons of his wrath — to destroy the whole country.",
  "6": "Wail! For the day of the LORD is near. It will come as destruction from the Almighty.",
  "7": "Therefore everyone’s hands will become weak, and every man will lose heart.",
  "8": "They will be horrified; pain and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look at each other, their faces flushed with fear.",
  "9": "Look, the day of the LORD is coming — cruel, with rage and burning anger — to make the earth a desolation and to destroy its sinners.",
  "10": "Indeed, the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will not shine.",
  "11": "I will punish the world for its evil, and wicked people for their iniquities. I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant and humiliate the insolence of tyrants.",
  "12": "I will make a human more scarce than fine gold, and mankind more rare than the gold of Ophir.",
  "13": "Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will shake from its foundations at the wrath of the LORD of Armies, on the day of his burning anger.",
  "14": "Like wandering gazelles and like sheep without a shepherd, each one will turn to his own people, each one will flee to his own land.",
  "15": "Whoever is found will be stabbed, and whoever is caught will die by the sword.",
  "16": "Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted, and their wives raped.",
  "17": "Look! I am stirring up the Medes against them, who cannot be bought off with silver and who have no desire for gold.",
  "18": "Their bows will cut young men to pieces. They will have no compassion on offspring; they will not look with pity on children.",
  "19": "And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.",
  "20": "It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; a nomad will not pitch his tent there, and shepherds will not let their flocks rest there.",
  "21": "But desert creatures will lie down there, and owls will fill the houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.",
  "22": "Hyenas will howl in the fortresses, and jackals, in the luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is almost up; her days are almost over."
