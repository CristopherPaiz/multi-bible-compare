  "1": "LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you. I will praise your name, for you have accomplished wonders, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.",
  "2": "For you have turned the city into a pile of rocks, a fortified city, into ruins; the fortress of barbarians is no longer a city; it will never be rebuilt.",
  "3": "Therefore, a strong people will honor you. The cities of violent nations will fear you.",
  "4": "For you have been a stronghold for the poor person, a stronghold for the needy in his distress, a refuge from storms and a shade from heat. When the breath of the violent is like a storm against a wall,",
  "5": "like heat in a dry land, you will subdue the uproar of barbarians. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day, so he will silence the song of the violent.",
  "6": "On this mountain, the LORD of Armies will prepare for all the peoples a feast of choice meat, a feast with aged wine, prime cuts of choice meat, fine vintage wine.",
  "7": "On this mountain he will destroy the burial shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations;",
  "8": "he will destroy death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove his people’s disgrace from the whole earth, for the LORD has spoken.",
  "9": "On that day it will be said, “Look, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he has saved us. This is the LORD; we have waited for him. Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”",
  "10": "For the LORD’s power will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trampled in a dung pile.",
  "11": "He will spread out his arms in the middle of it, as a swimmer spreads out his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, along with the trickery of his hands.",
  "12": "The high-walled fortress will be brought down, thrown to the ground, to the dust."
