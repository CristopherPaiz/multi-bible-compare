  "5": "Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your descendants from the east, and gather you from the west.",
  "6": "I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back!’ Bring my sons from far away, and my daughters from the ends of the earth  —",

  "8": "Bring out a people who are blind, yet have eyes, and are deaf, yet have ears.",
  "9": "All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled. Who among them can declare this, and tell us the former things? Let them present their witnesses to vindicate themselves, so that people may hear and say, “It is true.”",
  "10": "“You are my witnesses”  — this is the LORD’s declaration — “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. No god was formed before me, and there will be none after me.",
  "11": "I — I am the LORD. Besides me, there is no Savior.",
  "12": "I alone declared, saved, and proclaimed — and not some foreign god among you. So you are my witnesses” — this is the LORD’s declaration — “and I am God.",
  "13": "Also, from today on I am he alone, and none can rescue from my power. I act, and who can reverse it?”",
  "14": "This is what the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: Because of you, I will send an army to Babylon and bring all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans in the ships in which they rejoice.",
  "15": "I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.",
  "16": "This is what the LORD says — who makes a way in the sea, and a path through raging water,",
  "17": "who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty one together (they lie down, they do not rise again; they are extinguished, put out like a wick ) —",
  "18": "“Do not remember the past events, pay no attention to things of old.",
  "19": "Look, I am about to do something new; even now it is coming. Do you not see it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.",
  "20": "Wild animals — jackals and ostriches — will honor me, because I provide water in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people.",
  "21": "The people I formed for myself will declare my praise.",
  "22": "“But, Jacob, you have not called on me, because, Israel, you have become weary of me.",

  "24": "You have not bought me aromatic cane with silver, or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins; you have wearied me with your iniquities.",
  "25": "“I — I sweep away your transgressions for my own sake and remember your sins no more.",
  "26": "Remind me. Let’s argue the case together. Recount the facts, so that you may be vindicated.",
