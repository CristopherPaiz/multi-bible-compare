  "1": "I will not keep silent because of Zion, and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem, until her righteousness shines like a bright light and her salvation, like a flaming torch.",
  "2": "Nations will see your righteousness and all kings, your glory. You will be given a new name that the LORD’s mouth will announce.",
  "3": "You will be a glorious crown in the LORD’s hand, and a royal diadem in the palm of your God’s hand.",
  "4": "You will no longer be called Deserted, and your land will not be called Desolate; instead, you will be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land will be married.",
  "5": "For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a groom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.",

  "7": "Do not give him rest until he establishes and makes Jerusalem the praise of the earth.",
  "8": "The LORD has sworn with his right hand and his strong arm: I will no longer give your grain to your enemies for food, and foreigners will not drink the new wine for which you have labored.",

  "10": "Go out, go out through the city gates; prepare a way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones! Raise a banner for the peoples.",

  "12": "And they will be called the Holy People, the LORD’s Redeemed; and you will be called Cared For, A City Not Deserted."
