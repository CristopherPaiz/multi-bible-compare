  "1": "A pronouncement concerning Damascus: Look, Damascus is no longer a city. It has become a ruined heap.",
  "2": "The cities of Aroer are abandoned; they will be places for flocks. They will lie down without fear.",
  "3": "The fortress disappears from Ephraim, and a kingdom from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the splendor of the Israelites. This is the declaration of the LORD of Armies.",
  "4": "On that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, and his healthy body will become emaciated.",
  "5": "It will be as if a reaper had gathered standing grain — his arm harvesting the heads of grain — and as if one had gleaned heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.",
  "6": "Only gleanings will be left in Israel, as if an olive tree had been beaten — two or three olives at the very top of the tree, four or five on its fruitful branches. This is the declaration of the LORD, the God of Israel.",

  "8": "They will not look to the altars they made with their hands or to the Asherahs and shrines they made with their fingers.",

  "12": "Ah! The roar of many peoples — they roar like the roaring of the seas. The raging of the nations — they rage like the rumble of rushing water.",
  "13": "The nations rage like the rumble of a huge torrent. He rebukes them, and they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills and like tumbleweeds before a gale.",
  "14": "In the evening — sudden terror! Before morning — it is gone! This is the fate of those who plunder us and the lot of those who ravage us."
