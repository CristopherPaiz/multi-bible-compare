  "3": "Grief is better than laughter, for when a face is sad, a heart may be glad.",
  "4": "The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure.",
  "5": "It is better to listen to rebuke from a wise person than to listen to the song of fools,",
  "6": "for like the crackling of burning thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.",
  "7": "Surely, the practice of extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the mind.",

  "10": "Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” since it is not wise of you to ask this.",
  "11": "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance and an advantage to those who see the sun,",
  "12": "because wisdom is protection as silver is protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.",

  "16": "Don’t be excessively righteous, and don’t be overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?",
  "17": "Don’t be excessively wicked, and don’t be foolish. Why should you die before your time?",
  "18": "It is good that you grasp the one and do not let the other slip from your hand. For the one who fears God will end up with both of them.",

  "28": "which my soul continually searches for but does not find: I found one person in a thousand, but none of those was a woman.",
  "29": "Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright, but they pursued many schemes.”"
