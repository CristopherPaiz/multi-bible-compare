  "1": "In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. Peoples will stream to it,",
  "2": "and many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about his ways so we may walk in his paths.” For instruction will go out of Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.",
  "3": "He will settle disputes among many peoples and provide arbitration for strong nations that are far away. They will beat their swords into plows and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not take up the sword against nation, and they will never again train for war.",
  "4": "But each person will sit under his grapevine and under his fig tree with no one to frighten him. For the mouth of the LORD of Armies has spoken.",
  "5": "Though all the peoples each walk in the name of their gods, we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.",
  "6": "On that day — this is the LORD’s declaration — I will assemble the lame and gather the scattered, those I have injured.",
  "7": "I will make the lame into a remnant, those far removed into a strong nation. Then the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time on and forever.",
  "8": "And you, watchtower for the flock, fortified hill of Daughter Zion, the former rule will come to you; sovereignty will come to Daughter Jerusalem.",
  "9": "Now, why are you shouting loudly? Is there no king with you? Has your counselor perished so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?",
  "10": "Writhe and cry out, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you will leave the city and camp in the open fields. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the grasp of your enemies!",
  "11": "Many nations have now assembled against you; they say, “Let her be defiled, and let us feast our eyes on Zion.”",
  "12": "But they do not know the LORD’s intentions or understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.",
  "13": "Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will make your horns iron and your hooves bronze so you can crush many peoples. Then you will set apart their plunder for the LORD, their wealth for the Lord of the whole earth."
