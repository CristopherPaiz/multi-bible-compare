  "1": "Israel is a lush vine; it yields fruit for itself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better they made the sacred pillars.",
  "2": "Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.",
  "3": "In fact, they are now saying, “We have no king! For we do not fear the LORD. What can a king do for us?”",
  "4": "They speak mere words, taking false oaths while making covenants. So lawsuits break out like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.",
  "5": "The residents of Samaria will have anxiety over the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its idolatrous priests rejoiced over it; the people will mourn over it, over its glory. It will certainly go into exile.",
  "6": "The calf itself will be taken to Assyria as an offering to the great king. Ephraim will experience shame; Israel will be ashamed of its counsel.",
  "7": "Samaria’s king will disappear like foam on the surface of the water.",
  "8": "The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. They will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”",
  "9": "Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; they have taken their stand there. Will not war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah?",
  "10": "I will discipline them at my discretion; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their double iniquity.",
  "11": "Ephraim is a well-trained calf that loves to thresh, but I will place a yoke on her fine neck. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will plow; Jacob will do the final plowing.",
  "12": "Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the LORD until he comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain.",
  "13": "You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in your large number of soldiers,",
  "14": "the roar of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortifications will be demolished in a day of war, like Shalman’s destruction of Beth-arbel. Mothers will be dashed to pieces along with their children.",
  "15": "So it will be done to you, Bethel, because of your extreme evil. At dawn the king of Israel will be totally destroyed."
