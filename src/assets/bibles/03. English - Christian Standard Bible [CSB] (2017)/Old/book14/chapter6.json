  "6": "But I have chosen Jerusalem so that my name will be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.”",
  "7": "My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "8": "However, the LORD said to my father David, “Since it was your desire to build a temple for my name, you have done well to have this desire.",
  "9": "Yet, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own offspring, will build the temple for my name.”",
  "10": "So the LORD has fulfilled what he promised. I have taken the place of my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the temple for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",

  "12": "Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire congregation of Israel and spread out his hands.",
  "13": "For Solomon had made a bronze platform 7½ feet long, 7½ feet wide, and 4½ feet high and put it in the court. He stood on it, knelt down in front of the entire congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven.",
  "14": "He said: LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth, who keeps his gracious covenant with your servants who walk before you with all their heart.",
  "15": "You have kept what you promised to your servant, my father David. You spoke directly to him, and you fulfilled your promise by your power, as it is today.",

  "17": "Now, LORD God of Israel, please confirm what you promised to your servant David.",
  "18": "But will God indeed live on earth with humans? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain you, much less this temple I have built.",
  "19": "Listen to your servant’s prayer and his petition, LORD my God, so that you may hear the cry and the prayer that your servant prays before you,",
  "20": "so that your eyes watch over this temple day and night, toward the place where you said you would put your name; and so that you may hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.",
  "21": "Hear the petitions of your servant and your people Israel, which they pray toward this place. May you hear in your dwelling place in heaven. May you hear and forgive.",
  "22": "If a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath and he comes to take an oath before your altar in this temple,",

  "24": "If your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against you, and they return to you and praise your name, and they pray and plead for mercy before you in this temple,",
  "25": "may you hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel. May you restore them to the land you gave them and their ancestors.",
  "26": "When the skies are shut and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and they pray toward this place and praise your name, and they turn from their sins because you are afflicting them,",
  "27": "may you hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, so that you may teach them the good way they should walk in. May you send rain on your land that you gave your people for an inheritance.",
  "28": "When there is famine in the land, when there is pestilence, when there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper, when their enemies besiege them in the land and its cities, when there is any plague or illness,",
  "29": "every prayer or petition that any person or that all your people Israel may have — they each know their own affliction and suffering — as they spread out their hands toward this temple,",
  "30": "may you hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and may you forgive and give to everyone according to all their ways, since you know each heart, for you alone know the human heart,",
  "31": "so that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days they live on the land you gave our ancestors.",
  "32": "Even for the foreigner who is not of your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your strong hand and outstretched arm: when he comes and prays toward this temple,",
  "33": "may you hear in heaven in your dwelling place, and do all the foreigner asks you. Then all the peoples of the earth will know your name, to fear you as your people Israel do and know that this temple I have built bears your name.",
  "34": "When your people go out to fight against their enemies, wherever you send them, and they pray to you in the direction of this city you have chosen and the temple that I have built for your name,",
  "35": "may you hear their prayer and petition in heaven and uphold their cause.",
  "36": "When they sin against you — for there is no one who does not sin  — and you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, and their captors deport them to a distant or nearby country,",
  "37": "and when they come to their senses in the land where they were deported and repent and petition you in their captors’ land, saying: “We have sinned and done wrong; we have been wicked,”",
  "38": "and when they return to you with all their mind and all their heart in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive, and when they pray in the direction of their land that you gave their ancestors, and the city you have chosen, and toward the temple I have built for your name,",
  "39": "may you hear their prayer and petitions in heaven, your dwelling place, and uphold their cause. May you forgive your people who sinned against you.",
  "40": "Now, my God, please let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.",
  "41": "Now therefore: Arise, LORD God, come to your resting place, you and your powerful ark. May your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and may your faithful people rejoice in goodness.",
  "42": "LORD God, do not reject your anointed one; remember the promises to your servant David."
