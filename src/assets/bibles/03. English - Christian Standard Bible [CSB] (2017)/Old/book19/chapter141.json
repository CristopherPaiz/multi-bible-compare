  "1": "A psalm of David. [1] LORD, I call on you; hurry to help me. Listen to my voice when I call on you.",
  "2": "May my prayer be set before you as incense, the raising of my hands as the evening offering.",
  "3": "LORD, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing or perform wicked acts with men who commit sin. Do not let me feast on their delicacies.",
  "5": "Let the righteous one strike me — it is an act of faithful love; let him rebuke me — it is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. Even now my prayer is against the evil acts of the wicked.",
  "6": "When their rulers will be thrown off the sides of a cliff, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasing.",
  "7": "As when one plows and breaks up the soil, turning up rocks, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.",
  "8": "But my eyes look to you, LORD, my Lord. I seek refuge in you; do not let me die.",
  "9": "Protect me from the trap they have set for me, and from the snares of evildoers.",
  "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely."
