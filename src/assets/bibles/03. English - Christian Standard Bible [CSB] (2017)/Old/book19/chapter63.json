  "1": "A psalm of David. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah. [1] God, you are my God; I eagerly seek you. I thirst for you; my body faints for you in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water.",
  "2": "So I gaze on you in the sanctuary to see your strength and your glory.",
  "3": "My lips will glorify you because your faithful love is better than life.",
  "4": "So I will bless you as long as I live; at your name, I will lift up my hands.",
  "5": "You satisfy me as with rich food; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.",
  "6": "When I think of you as I lie on my bed, I meditate on you during the night watches",
  "7": "because you are my helper; I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.",
  "8": "I follow close to you; your right hand holds on to me.",
  "9": "But those who intend to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth.",
  "10": "They will be given over to the power of the sword; they will become a meal for jackals.",
  "11": "But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by him will boast, for the mouths of liars will be shut."
