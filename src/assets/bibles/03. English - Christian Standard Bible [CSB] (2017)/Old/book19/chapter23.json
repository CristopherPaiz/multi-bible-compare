  "4": "Even when I go through the darkest valley, I fear no danger, for you are with me; your rod and your staff — they comfort me.",
  "5": "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.",
  "6": "Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD as long as I live."
