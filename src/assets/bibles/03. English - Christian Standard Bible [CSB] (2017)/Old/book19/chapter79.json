  "1": "A psalm of Asaph. [1] God, the nations have invaded your inheritance, desecrated your holy temple, and turned Jerusalem into ruins.",
  "2": "They gave the corpses of your servants to the birds of the sky for food, the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.",
  "3": "They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.",
  "4": "We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.",
  "5": "How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,",
  "7": "for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.",
  "8": "Do not hold past iniquities against us; let your compassion come to us quickly, for we have become very weak.",
  "9": "God of our salvation, help us  — for the glory of your name. Rescue us and atone for our sins, for your name’s sake.",
  "10": "Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, let vengeance for the shed blood of your servants be known among the nations.",
  "11": "Let the groans of the prisoners reach you; according to your great power, preserve those condemned to die.",
  "12": "Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors the reproach they have hurled at you, Lord.",
  "13": "Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will thank you forever; we will declare your praise to generation after generation."
