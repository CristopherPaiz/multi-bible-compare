  "1": "LORD, why do you stand so far away? Why do you hide in times of trouble?",
  "2": "In arrogance the wicked relentlessly pursue their victims; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.",
  "3": "For the wicked one boasts about his own cravings; the one who is greedy curses and despises the LORD.",
  "4": "In all his scheming, the wicked person arrogantly thinks, “There’s no accountability, since there’s no God.”",
  "5": "His ways are always secure; your lofty judgments have no effect on him; he scoffs at all his adversaries.",
  "6": "He says to himself, “I will never be moved — from generation to generation without calamity.”",
  "7": "Cursing, deceit, and violence fill his mouth; trouble and malice are under his tongue.",
  "8": "He waits in ambush near settlements; he kills the innocent in secret places. His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless;",
  "9": "he lurks in secret like a lion in a thicket. He lurks in order to seize a victim; he seizes a victim and drags him in his net.",
  "10": "So he is oppressed and beaten down; helpless people fall because of the wicked one’s strength.",
  "11": "He says to himself, “God has forgotten; he hides his face and will never see.”",
  "12": "Rise up, LORD God! Lift up your hand. Do not forget the oppressed.",
  "13": "Why has the wicked person despised God? He says to himself, “You will not demand an account.”",
  "14": "But you yourself have seen trouble and grief, observing it in order to take the matter into your hands. The helpless one entrusts himself to you; you are a helper of the fatherless.",
  "15": "Break the arm of the wicked, evil person, until you look for his wickedness, but it can’t be found.",
  "16": "The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.",
  "17": "LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble; you will strengthen their hearts. You will listen carefully,",
  "18": "doing justice for the fatherless and the oppressed so that mere humans from the earth may terrify them no more."
