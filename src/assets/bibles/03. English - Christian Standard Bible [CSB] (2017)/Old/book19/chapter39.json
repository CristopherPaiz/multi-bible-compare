  "1": "For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. [1] I said, “I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are in my presence.”",
  "2": "I was speechless and quiet; I kept silent, even from speaking good, and my pain intensified.",
  "3": "My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, a fire burned. I spoke with my tongue:",
  "4": "“LORD, make me aware of my end and the number of my days so that I will know how short-lived I am.",
  "5": "In fact, you have made my days just inches long, and my life span is as nothing to you. Yes, every human being stands as only a vapor. Selah",
  "6": "Yes, a person goes about like a mere shadow. Indeed, they rush around in vain, gathering possessions without knowing who will get them.",
  "7": "“Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.",
  "8": "Rescue me from all my transgressions; do not make me the taunt of fools.",
  "9": "I am speechless; I do not open my mouth because of what you have done.",
  "10": "Remove your torment from me. Because of the force of your hand I am finished.",
  "11": "You discipline a person with punishment for iniquity, consuming like a moth what is precious to him; yes, every human being is only a vapor. Selah",
  "12": "“Hear my prayer, LORD, and listen to my cry for help; do not be silent at my tears. For I am here with you as an alien, a temporary resident like all my ancestors.",
  "13": "Turn your angry gaze from me so that I may be cheered up before I die and am gone.”"
