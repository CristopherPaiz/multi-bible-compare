  "1": "A psalm of David for remembrance. [1] LORD, do not punish me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.",
  "2": "For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has pressed down on me.",
  "3": "There is no soundness in my body because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.",
  "4": "For my iniquities have flooded over my head; they are a burden too heavy for me to bear.",
  "5": "My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.",
  "6": "I am bent over and brought very low; all day long I go around in mourning.",
  "7": "For my insides are full of burning pain, and there is no soundness in my body.",
  "8": "I am faint and severely crushed; I groan because of the anguish of my heart.",
  "9": "Lord, my every desire is in front of you; my sighing is not hidden from you.",
  "10": "My heart races, my strength leaves me, and even the light of my eyes has faded.",
  "11": "My loved ones and friends stand back from my affliction, and my relatives stand at a distance.",
  "12": "Those who intend to kill me set traps, and those who want to harm me threaten to destroy me; they plot treachery all day long.",
  "13": "I am like a deaf person; I do not hear. I am like a speechless person who does not open his mouth.",
  "14": "I am like a man who does not hear and has no arguments in his mouth.",
  "15": "For I put my hope in you, LORD; you will answer me, my Lord, my God.",
  "16": "For I said, “Don’t let them rejoice over me — those who are arrogant toward me when I stumble.”",
  "17": "For I am about to fall, and my pain is constantly with me.",
  "18": "So I confess my iniquity; I am anxious because of my sin.",
  "19": "But my enemies are vigorous and powerful; many hate me for no reason.",
  "20": "Those who repay evil for good attack me for pursuing good.",
  "21": "LORD, do not abandon me; my God, do not be far from me.",
  "22": "Hurry to help me, my Lord, my salvation."
