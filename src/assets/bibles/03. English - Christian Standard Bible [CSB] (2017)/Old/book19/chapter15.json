  "1": "A psalm of David. [1] LORD, who can dwell in your tent? Who can live on your holy mountain?",
  "2": "The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart  —",
  "3": "who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor,",
  "4": "who despises the one rejected by the LORD but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his word whatever the cost,",
  "5": "who does not lend his silver at interest or take a bribe against the innocent  — the one who does these things will never be shaken."
