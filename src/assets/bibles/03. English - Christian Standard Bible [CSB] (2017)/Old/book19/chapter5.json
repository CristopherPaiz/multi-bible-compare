  "1": "For the choir director: with the flutes. A psalm of David. [1] Listen to my words, LORD; consider my sighing.",

  "4": "For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil cannot dwell with you.",
  "5": "The boastful cannot stand in your sight; you hate all evildoers.",
  "6": "You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors violent and treacherous people.",
  "7": "But I enter your house by the abundance of your faithful love; I bow down toward your holy temple in reverential awe of you.",
  "8": "LORD, lead me in your righteousness because of my adversaries; make your way straight before me.",
  "9": "For there is nothing reliable in what they say; destruction is within them; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongues.",
