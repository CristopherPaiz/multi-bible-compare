  "1": "For the choir director: according to “The Deer of the Dawn.” A psalm of David. [1] My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you so far from my deliverance and from my words of groaning?",
  "2": "My God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, by night, yet I have no rest.",
  "3": "But you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.",
  "4": "Our fathers trusted in you; they trusted, and you rescued them.",
  "5": "They cried to you and were set free; they trusted in you and were not disgraced.",
  "6": "But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by people.",
  "7": "Everyone who sees me mocks me; they sneer and shake their heads:",
  "8": "“He relies on the LORD; let him save him; let the LORD rescue him, since he takes pleasure in him.”",
  "9": "It was you who brought me out of the womb, making me secure at my mother’s breast.",
  "10": "I was given over to you at birth; you have been my God from my mother’s womb.",
  "11": "Don’t be far from me, because distress is near and there’s no one to help.",
  "12": "Many bulls surround me; strong ones of Bashan encircle me.",
  "13": "They open their mouths against me — lions, mauling and roaring.",
  "14": "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed; my heart is like wax, melting within me.",
  "15": "My strength is dried up like baked clay; my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You put me into the dust of death.",
  "16": "For dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has closed in on me; they pierced my hands and my feet.",
  "17": "I can count all my bones; people look and stare at me.",
  "18": "They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.",
  "19": "But you, LORD, don’t be far away. My strength, come quickly to help me.",
  "20": "Rescue my life from the sword, my only life from the power of these dogs.",
  "21": "Save me from the lion’s mouth, from the horns of wild oxen. You answered me!",
  "22": "I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters; I will praise you in the assembly.",
  "23": "You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! All you descendants of Israel, revere him!",
  "24": "For he has not despised or abhorred the torment of the oppressed. He did not hide his face from him but listened when he cried to him for help.",
  "25": "I will give praise in the great assembly because of you; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear you.",
  "26": "The humble will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise him. May your hearts live forever!",
  "27": "All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before you,",
  "28": "for kingship belongs to the LORD; he rules the nations.",
  "29": "All who prosper on earth will eat and bow down; all those who go down to the dust will kneel before him — even the one who cannot preserve his life.",
  "30": "Their descendants will serve him; the next generation will be told about the Lord.",
  "31": "They will come and declare his righteousness; to a people yet to be born they will declare what he has done."
