  "1": "A song of ascents. Of Solomon. [1] Unless the LORD builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the LORD watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain.",
  "2": "In vain you get up early and stay up late, working hard to have enough food —  yes, he gives sleep to the one he loves.",
  "3": "Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, offspring, a reward.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one’s youth.",
  "5": "Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them. They will never be put to shame when they speak with their enemies at the city gate."
