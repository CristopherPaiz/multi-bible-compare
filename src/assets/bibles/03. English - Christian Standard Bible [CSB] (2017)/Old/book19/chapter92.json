  "1": "A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. [1] It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praise to your name, Most High,",
  "2": "to declare your faithful love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,",
  "3": "with a ten-stringed harp and the music of a lyre.",
  "4": "For you have made me rejoice, LORD, by what you have done; I will shout for joy because of the works of your hands.",
  "5": "How magnificent are your works, LORD, how profound your thoughts!",
  "6": "A stupid person does not know, a fool does not understand this:",
  "7": "though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be eternally destroyed.",
  "8": "But you, LORD, are exalted forever.",
  "9": "For indeed, LORD, your enemies — indeed, your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.",
  "10": "You have lifted up my horn like that of a wild ox; I have been anointed with the finest oil.",
  "11": "My eyes look at my enemies; when evildoers rise against me, my ears hear them.",
  "12": "The righteous thrive like a palm tree and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon.",
  "13": "Planted in the house of the LORD, they thrive in the courts of our God.",
  "14": "They will still bear fruit in old age, healthy and green,",
  "15": "to declare: “The LORD is just; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.”"
