  "1": "My soul, bless the LORD! LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with majesty and splendor.",
  "2": "He wraps himself in light as if it were a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy,",
  "3": "laying the beams of his palace on the waters above, making the clouds his chariot, walking on the wings of the wind,",
  "4": "and making the winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.",
  "5": "He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken.",
  "6": "You covered it with the deep as if it were a garment; the water stood above the mountains.",
  "7": "At your rebuke the water fled; at the sound of your thunder they hurried away  —",
  "8": "mountains rose and valleys sank  — to the place you established for them.",
  "9": "You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never cover the earth again.",
  "10": "He causes the springs to gush into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.",
  "11": "They supply water for every wild beast; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.",
  "12": "The birds of the sky live beside the springs; they make their voices heard among the foliage.",
  "13": "He waters the mountains from his palace; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of your labor.",
  "14": "He causes grass to grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth,",
  "15": "wine that makes human hearts glad — making his face shine with oil — and bread that sustains human hearts.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD flourish, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.",
  "17": "There the birds make their nests; storks make their homes in the pine trees.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.",
  "19": "He made the moon to mark the festivals; the sun knows when to set.",
  "20": "You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals stir.",
  "21": "The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.",
  "22": "The sun rises; they go back and lie down in their dens.",
  "23": "Man goes out to his work and to his labor until evening.",
  "24": "How countless are your works, LORD! In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.",
  "25": "Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number — living things both large and small.",
  "26": "There the ships move about, and Leviathan, which you formed to play there.",
  "27": "All of them wait for you to give them their food at the right time.",
  "28": "When you give it to them, they gather it; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.",
  "29": "When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.",
  "30": "When you send your breath, they are created, and you renew the surface of the ground.",
  "31": "May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works.",
  "32": "He looks at the earth, and it trembles; he touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live.",
  "34": "May my meditation be pleasing to him; I will rejoice in the LORD.",
  "35": "May sinners vanish from the earth and wicked people be no more. My soul, bless the LORD! Hallelujah!"
