  "1": "For the choir director. A psalm of David. [1] I waited patiently for the LORD, and he turned to me and heard my cry for help.",

  "3": "He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and they will trust in the LORD.",
  "4": "How happy is anyone who has put his trust in the LORD and has not turned to the proud or to those who run after lies!",
  "5": "LORD my God, you have done many things — your wondrous works and your plans for us; none can compare with you. If I were to report and speak of them, they are more than can be told.",
  "6": "You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; you open my ears to listen. You do not ask for a whole burnt offering or a sin offering.",
  "7": "Then I said, “See, I have come; in the scroll it is written about me.",
  "8": "I delight to do your will, my God, and your instruction is deep within me.”",
  "9": "I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; see, I do not keep my mouth closed  — as you know, LORD.",

  "11": "LORD, you do not withhold your compassion from me. Your constant love and truth will always guard me.",
