  "1": "For the choir director. A of the sons of Korah. [1] God, we have heard with our ears — our ancestors have told us — the work you accomplished in their days, in days long ago:",
  "2": "In order to plant them, you displaced the nations by your hand; in order to settle them, you brought disaster on the peoples.",
  "3": "For they did not take the land by their sword — their arm did not bring them victory — but by your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable toward them.",
  "4": "You are my King, my God, who ordains victories for Jacob.",
  "5": "Through you we drive back our foes; through your name we trample our enemies.",
  "6": "For I do not trust in my bow, and my sword does not bring me victory.",
  "7": "But you give us victory over our foes and let those who hate us be disgraced.",
  "8": "We boast in God all day long; we will praise your name forever. Selah",
  "9": "But you have rejected and humiliated us; you do not march out with our armies.",
  "10": "You make us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have taken plunder for themselves.",
  "11": "You hand us over to be eaten like sheep and scatter us among the nations.",
  "12": "You sell your people for nothing; you make no profit from selling them.",
  "13": "You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.",
  "14": "You make us a joke among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.",
  "15": "My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face,",
  "16": "because of the taunts of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy and avenger.",
  "17": "All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten you or betrayed your covenant.",
  "18": "Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from your path.",
  "19": "But you have crushed us in a haunt of jackals and have covered us with deepest darkness.",
  "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god,",
  "21": "wouldn’t God have found this out, since he knows the secrets of the heart?",
  "22": "Because of you we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.",
  "23": "Wake up, LORD! Why are you sleeping? Get up! Don’t reject us forever!",
  "24": "Why do you hide and forget our affliction and oppression?",
  "25": "For we have sunk down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.",
  "26": "Rise up! Help us! Redeem us because of your faithful love."
