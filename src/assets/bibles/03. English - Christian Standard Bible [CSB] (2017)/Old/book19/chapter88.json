  "1": "A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to A of Heman the Ezrahite. [1] LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out before you day and night.",
  "2": "May my prayer reach your presence; listen to my cry.",
  "3": "For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol.",
  "4": "I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength,",
  "5": "abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom you no longer remember, and who are cut off from your care.",
  "6": "You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths.",
  "7": "Your wrath weighs heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah",
  "8": "You have distanced my friends from me; you have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out.",
  "9": "My eyes are worn out from crying. LORD, I cry out to you all day long; I spread out my hands to you.",
  "10": "Do you work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise you? Selah",

  "17": "They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side.",
  "18": "You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my only friend."
