  "4": "Be not ye like your forefathers, unto whom the Prophets cried a fore time, saying: Thus sayeth the LORD God of hosts: Turn you from your evil ways, and from your wicked imaginations. But they would not hear, nor regard me, sayeth the LORD.",
  "5": "What is now become of your forefathers and the prophets? are they yet still alive?",
  "6": "But did not my words and statutes (which I commanded by my servants the Prophets) touch your forefathers? Upon this, they gave answer and said: like as the LORD of Hosts devised to do unto us, according to our ways and imaginations, even so hath he dealt with us.",

  "11": "And they answered the angel of the LORD, that stood among the myrtle trees, and said: We have gone thorow the world: and behold all the world dwell at ease, and are careless.",
  "12": "Then the LORD's angel gave answer, and said: O LORD of Hosts, how long wilt thou be unmerciful to Jerusalem and to the cities of Juda, with whom thou hast been displeased now these seventy years.",

  "16": "Therefore thus sayeth the LORD: I will turn me again in mercy toward Jerusalem, so that my house shall be builded in it, sayeth the LORD of Hosts: yea and the plummet shall be laid abroad in Jerusalem, sayeth the LORD of Hosts.",
  "17": "Cry also, and speak: thus sayeth the LORD of Hosts: My cities shall be in good prosperity again, the LORD shall yet comfort Sion, and choose Jerusalem.",

  "20": "And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.",
  "21": "Then said I: what will these do? He answered, and said: Those are the horns, which have so strowed Juda abroad, that no man durst lift up his head: But these are come to fraye them away, and to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lift up their horn over the land of Juda, to scatter it abroad."
