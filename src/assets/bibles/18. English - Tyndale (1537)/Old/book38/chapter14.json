  "1": "Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, that thou shalt be spoiled and robbed:",
  "2": "For I will gather together all the Heathen, to fight against Jerusalem: so that the city shall be won, the houses spoiled, and the women defiled. The half of the city shall go away into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be carried out of the city.",
  "3": "After that shall the LORD go forth, to fight against those Heathen, as men use to fight in the day of battle.",
  "4": "Then shall his feet stand(stode) upon the mount olivete, that lieth upon the east side of Jerusalem. And the mount olivete shall cleave in two, eastward and westward, so that there shall be a great valley: and the half mount shall remove toward the north, and the other half toward the south.",
  "5": "And ye shall flee unto the valley of my hills, for the valley of the hills shall reach unto Asia. Yea flee shall ye, like as ye fled for the earthquake in the days of Osiah king of Juda. And the LORD my God shall come, and all saints with him.",
  "6": "In that day shall it not be light, but cold and frost.",
  "7": "This shall be that special day which is known unto the LORD: neither day nor night, but about the evening time it shall be light.",
  "8": "In that time shall there waters of life run out from Jerusalem: the half part of them toward the east sea, and the other half toward the uttermost(utmost) sea, and shall continue both summer and winter.",
  "9": "And the LORD himself shall be king over all the earth. At that time shall there be one LORD only, and his name shall be but one.",
  "10": "Men shall go about the whole earth, as upon a field: from Gibea to Remmon, and from the south to Jerusalem. She shall be set up, and inhabited in her place: from BenJamin's port, unto the place of the first port, and unto the corner port: and from the tower of Hananeel, unto the king's wine presses.",
  "11": "There shall men dwell, and there shall be no more cursing, but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.",
  "12": "This shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite all people, that have fought against Jerusalem: Namely, their flesh shall consume away, though they stand upon their feet: their eyes shall be corrupt in their holes, and their tongue shall consume in their mouth.",
  "13": "In that day shall the LORD make a great sedition among them, so that one man shall take another by the hand, and lay his hands upon the hands of his neighbour.",
  "14": "Juda shall fight also against Jerusalem, and the goods of all the Heathen shall be gathered together round about: gold and silver and a very great multitude of clothes.",
  "15": "And so shall this plague go over horses, mules, camels, asses, and all the beasts that shall be in the host, like as yonder plague was.",
  "16": "Every one that remaineth then of all the people, which came against Jerusalem, shall go up yearly, to worship the King (even the LORD of Hosts) and to keep the feast of tabernacles.",
  "17": "And look what generation upon earth goeth not up to Jerusalem, for to worship the King (even the LORD of Hosts) upon the same shall come no rain.",
  "18": "If the kindred of Egypt go not up, and come not, it shall not rain upon them neither. This shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all Heathen, that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles:",
  "19": "Yea this shall be the sin plague of Egypt and the sin plague of all people, that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.",
  "20": "At that time shall the riding gear of the horses be holy unto the LORD, and the kettles in the LORD's house shall be like the basins before the altar:",
  "21": "yea all the kettles in Jerusalem and Juda, shall be holy unto the LORD of Hosts: and all they that slay offerings, shall come and take of them, and dight them therein. And at that time there shall be no more Cananities in the house of the LORD. [The end of the prophecy of Zachary.]"
