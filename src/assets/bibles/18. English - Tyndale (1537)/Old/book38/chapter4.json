  "1": "And the angel that talked with me, came again, and waked me up, as a man that is raised out of his sleep,",
  "2": "and said unto me: What seest thou? And I said: I have looked, and behold: a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon it, and his seven lamps therein, and upon every lamp seven stalks.",
  "3": "And two olive trees thereby, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side.",
  "4": "So I answered, and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying: O my lord what are these?",
  "5": "The angel that talked with me answered and said unto me: knowest thou not what these be? And I said; No, my lord.",
  "6": "He answered, and said unto me: This is the word of the LORD unto Zorobabel, saying: Neither thorow an host of men, nor thorow strength, but thorow my spirit, sayeth the LORD of Hosts.",
  "7": "What art thou, thou great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou must be made even. And he shall bring up the first stone so that men shall cry unto him: good luck, good luck.",
  "8": "Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "9": "The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, his hands also shall finish it: that ye may know, how that the LORD of Hosts hath sent me unto you.",

  "12": "I spake moreover, and said unto him: what be these two olive branches (which thorow the two golden pipes) empty themselves into the gold?",
  "13": "He answered me, and said: knowest thou not, what these be? And I said: No, my lord.",
  "14": "Then said he: These are the two olive branches, that stand before the ruler of the whole earth."
