  "1": "This is the heavy burthen of Ninive, which Nahum of Elchos did write, as he saw it.",
  "2": "The LORD is a jealous God, and a taker of vengeance: yea a taker of vengeance is the LORD, and wrothful. The LORD taketh vengeance of his enemies, and reserveth displeasure for his adversaries.",
  "3": "The LORD suffereth long, he is of great power, and so innocent that he leaveth no man faultless before him. The LORD goeth forth in tempest and stormy weather, the clouds are the dust of his feet.",
  "4": "When he reproveth the sea, he drieth it up, and turneth all the floods to dry land. Basan is desolate, Charmel and the pleasure of Libnus wasteth away.",
  "5": "The mountains tremble for him, the hills consume. At the sight of him the earth quaketh: yea the whole world, and all that dwell therein.",
  "6": "Who may endure before his wrath? Or who is able to abide his grim displeasure? His anger taketh on like fire, and the hard rocks burst in sunder before him.",
  "7": "Full gracious is the LORD, and a strong hold in time of trouble, he knoweth them that put their trust in him:",

  "9": "What do ye imagine then against the LORD on this manner? (Tush, when he hath once made an end, there shall come no more trouble)",
  "10": "For like as the thorns that stick together, and as the dry straw, so shall the drunkards be consumed together, even when they be full.",
  "11": "There come out of thee such as Imagine mischief, and give ungracious counsel against the LORD.",
  "12": "Therefore thus sayeth the LORD: Let them be as well prepared, yea and as many as they can, yet shall they be hewn down, and pass away. And as for thee, I will vex thee, but not utterly destroy thee;",
  "13": "And now will I break his rod from thy back, and burst thy bonds in sunder.",
  "14": "But the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that there shall come no more seed of thy name. The carved and casten Images will I root out of the house of thy God. Thy grave shall I prepare for thee, and thou shalt be confounded.",
  "15": "Behold, upon the mountains come the feet of him, that bringeth good tidings, and preacheth peace. O Judah, keep thy holy days, perform thy promises: for Belial shall come no more in thee, he is utterly rooted out."
