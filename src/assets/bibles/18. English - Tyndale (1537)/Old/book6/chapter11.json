  "1": "And when Jabin king of Hazor had heard that: he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Someron, and to the king of Acsaph.",
  "2": "And unto the kings that are by north in the mountains, and plains, on the south side of Ceneroth, and in the low countries, and in the regions of Dor upon the sea,",
  "3": "and unto the Cananites both by East and west: and unto the Amorites, Hethites, Pheresites, and Jebusites in the mountains: and unto the Hevites under Hermon in the land of Mazphah:",
  "4": "which came out and all their hosts with them a multitude of folk even as the sands of the sea in number with horses and chariots exceeding many.",
  "5": "And all these kings met together, and came and pitched together upon the water of Merom, for to fight with Israel.",
  "6": "And the LORD said unto Josua: be not afraid of them: for tomorrow about this time I will deliver them all slain, before all Israel: and thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.",
  "7": "And Josua came and all the men of war with him against them, unto the water of Merom, suddenly, and fell upon them.",
  "8": "And the LORD delivered them into the hands of Israel: and they smote them and chased them, into great Sidon, and unto the hot waters, and unto the valley of Mazphah Eastward: and smote them until they had none remaining of them.",
  "9": "And Josua served them as the LORD bade him, houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.",
  "10": "Then Josua at that time turned back and took Hazor and smote her king with the sword. For Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdoms.",
  "11": "And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, that no breath was let remain. And burnt Hazor with fire",
  "12": "and all the cities of those kings, with all the kings of them, Josua took and smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.",
  "13": "But Israel burnt none of the cities that stood upon hills, save Hazor onely, that Josua burnt:",
  "14": "but all the spoil of the said cities and the cattle, the children of Israel caught unto themselves: But the men only they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them,",
  "15": "and had left no breath remaining. As the LORD commanded Josua, and even so did Josua and minished no word of all that the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "16": "And so Josua took all the land, the hills and all the south country, and all the land of Gosan, and the low country, and the plains, and the mountain of Israel, with the low country of the same,",
  "17": "even from mount Halak that goeth up to Seir, unto Baal Gad in the valley of Libanon, under mount Hermon. And all the kings of the same, he took and smote them, and slew them.",
  "18": "Josua made war long time with those kings:",
  "19": "for there was no city that made peace with the children of Israel, save those Hethites that inhabited Gibeon: All other they took with battle:",
  "20": "for it came of the LORD to harden their hearts: that they should come against Israel in battle: even to destroy them utterly, that they should have no mercy, but to bring them to naught. As the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "21": "And that same season, Josua went and destroyed the Enakites out of the mountains, and out of Hebron, Dabir, and Anab, and out of all the mountains of Juda, and out of all the mountains of Israel. And Josua destroyed them utterly with their cities.",
  "22": "So that there was not one Enakite left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Asah, Geth, and Asdod, there remained of them.",
  "23": "And Josua took the whole land according to all that the LORD said unto Moses, and gave it a possession unto Israel every man his part in their tribes: and the land rested from war."
