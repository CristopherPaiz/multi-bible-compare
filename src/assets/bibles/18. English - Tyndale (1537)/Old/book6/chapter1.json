  "5": "There shall not a man be able to withstand thee all the days of thy life. For as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee and will neither leave thee, nor forsake thee.",
  "6": "Be strong and bold: for unto this people shalt thou divide the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.",
  "7": "Above all thing be strong and harden thyself, to observe and to do, according to all the laws which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn therefrom neither to the right hand, nor to the left: that thou mayest have understanding in all thou takest in hand.",
  "8": "Let not the book of this law depart out of thy mouth: but record therein day and night that thou mayest be circumspect to do according to all that is written therein. For then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have understanding.",
  "9": "Behold, I have said unto thee, be strong and bold: neither fear, nor dread. For the LORD thy God is with thee whither soever thou goest.",
  "10": "Then Josua commanded the officers of the people saying:",
  "11": "Go thorow the midst of the host, and command the people saying, prepare you vitailles: for after three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go and enjoy the land which the LORD your God giveth you, to possess it.",

  "14": "Let your wives, your children and your cattle remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan: But go ye before your brethren Armyd, all that be men of war, and help them",
  "15": "until the LORD hath given your brethren rest, as he hath you, and until they also have obtained, the land which the LORD your God giveth them. And then return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it, which land Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the son rising.",
  "16": "And they answered Josua saying: All that thou biddest us, we will do, and whither soever thou sendest us, we will go.",
  "17": "According as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey thee, onely the LORD thy God be with thee as he was with Moses.",
  "18": "And whosoever disobey thy mouth, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, let him die: Onely be strong and of good courage."
