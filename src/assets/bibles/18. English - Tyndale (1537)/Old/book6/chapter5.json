  "1": "And when all the kings of the Amorites which are on this side Jordan to the seaward, and all the kings of the Cananites which lie on the sea heard, how the LORD had dried up the water of Jordan before the children of Israel, until they were over, their hearts fainted in them. And there was no spirit in them any more, for fear of the coming of the children of Israel.",
  "2": "That same time the LORD said unto Josua: Make thee knives of stone, and go to again and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.",
  "3": "And Josua made him knives of stone and circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of foreskins.",
  "4": "And this is the cause why Josua circumcised. All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all that were men of war, died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt.",
  "5": "Now all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt, they circumcised not.",
  "6": "For the children of Israel walked forty year in the wilderness, till all the people of men of war that came out of Egypt were consumed, which hearkened not unto the voice of God, so that the LORD sware, that he would not shew them the land which the LORD sware unto their fathers, that he would give us, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.",
  "7": "And their children he set up in their stead: them Josua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they circumcised them not by the way.",
  "8": "And when all the people were full circumcised, they abode still in their places in the host till they were whole.",
  "9": "And the LORD said unto Josua, this day I have taken away the shame of Egypt from you: and called the name of the same place Gilgal unto this day.",
  "10": "And the children of Israel pitched their tents in Gilgal, and held the feast of passover the fourteenth day of the month at even in the fields of Jericho.",
  "11": "And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow after passover, sweet cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day.",
  "12": "And Manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, neither had the children of Israel Manna any more, but did eat of the fruits of the land of Canaan that year.",
  "13": "And when Josua was come to Jericho, he lift up his eyes and looked: and behold there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Josua went unto him and said unto him, art thou on our side or on our adversaries?",
  "14": "And he answered, Nay, but I am the captain of the host of the LORD and am now come. And Josua fell on his face to the earth and did reverence, and said unto him, what sayeth my Lord(LORDE) unto his servant.",
  "15": "And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Josua: do thy shoes off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Josua did so."
