  "2": "come with the children of Israel and say: Appoint out free cities, of which I spake unto you by Moses,",
  "3": "that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly, may flee thither. And those cities shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.",
  "4": "And the slayer shall flee unto one of those Cities and shall stand in the entering of the gate of the city and shall shew his cause in the ears of the elders of the said city. And they shall take him into the city unto them, and shall give him a place that he may dwell among them.",
  "5": "And when the avenger of blood followeth after him they shall not deliver the slayer unto his hand: because he smote his friend ignorantly, and hated him not before time.",
  "6": "And he shall dwell in the said city until he stand before the congregation in judgement, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. And then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house, and unto the city from whence he fled.",
  "7": "And they appointed Kedes in Galile, in mount Nephthali, and Sichem in mount Ephraim, and kariatharbe which is Hebron, in the mountains of Juda.",
  "8": "And on the other side Jordan over against Jericho eastward, they gave Bozor in the wilderness upon the plain, out of the tribe of Ruben and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad and Golan in Basan out of the tribe of Manasses.",
  "9": "These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and to the strangers that Sojourned among them that whosoever killed any person ignorantly, the same might flee thither and should not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation."
