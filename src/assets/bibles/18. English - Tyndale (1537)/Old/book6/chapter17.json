  "1": "And the tribe of Manasses which was the eldest son of Joseph received a lot. And Machir the eldest son of Manasses which was the father of Gilead (and a man of war) had Gilead and Basan.",
  "2": "And the rest of the children of Manasses received by their kindreds: which were the children of Abiezer: the children of Nelek: the children of Asriel: the children of Sichen, the children of Nepher: the children of Semida. These are the male children of Manasses the son of Joseph in their kindreds.",
  "3": "But Zelaphead the son of Hepher the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, had no sons save daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahela, Noa, Hagla, Melcha, and Thirza:",
  "4": "which came before Eleazar the priest, and before Josua the son of Nun, and before the lords saying: the LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. And he gave them at the mouth of the LORD, an inheritance among the brethren of their fathers.",
  "5": "And there fell ten portions to Manasses beside the land of Gilead and Basan which are on the other side Jordan:",
  "6": "because the daughters of Manasses did inherit among his sons. And Manasses' other sons had the land of Gilead.",
  "7": "And the coasts of Manasses reached from Aser to Machmathah that lieth before Sichem and went along on the right hand, even unto the inhabiters of Enthaphuah,",
  "8": "and the land of Thaphuah belonged to Manasses, which Thaphuah lay in the borders between Manasses and the children of Ephraim.",
  "9": "And the coasts descended unto the river Canah on whose south side Ephraim hath cities among the cities of Manasses. For the coasts of Manasses were on the north side of the river and the ends of them was the sea:",
  "10": "so that the south pertained to Ephraim, and the north to Manasses, and the sea is his border. And they met together in Aser northward, and in Isacar Eastward.",
  "11": "And Manasses had in Isacar and in Aser, Bethsean, and her towns: and the inhabiters of Dor, with the towns pertaining to the same: and the inhabiters of Endor with the towns of the same: and the inhabiters of Thaanath with her towns and the inhabiters of Magedo with the towns of the same, even three countries:",
  "12": "yet the children of Manasses could not overcome those cities: But the Cananites began to dwell in the same land.",
  "13": "Nevertheless as soon as the children of Israel were waxed strong, they put the Cananites to tribute, but expelled them not.",
  "14": "And the children of Joseph spake unto Josua saying: why hast thou given us but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing we be much people, and for as much as the LORD hath blessed us so:",
  "15": "and Josua answered them: if ye be much people, then get you up to the wood country, and prepare for yourselves there in the land of the Pheresites and of the Raphaites, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for you.",
  "16": "Then the children of Joseph said again the hill will not be gotten of us: for all the Cananites that dwell in the low country have chariots of iron, and so have they that inhabit Bethsean, and the towns of the same, and they also that dwell in the valley of Jezreel.",
  "17": "And Josua answered the house of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasses saying: ye be much people and have great power and shall not therefore have one lot.",
  "18": "But the hill shall be yours, for it is a wood country and ye shall bring it to fashion, and it shall be yours even unto the ends of it, for ye shall be able to cast out the Cananites for all their iron chariots and for all they be so strong."
