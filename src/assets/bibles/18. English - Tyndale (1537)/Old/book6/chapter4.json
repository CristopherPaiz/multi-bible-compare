  "17": "And Josua commanded the priests saying: Ascend up out of Jordan.",
  "18": "And when the priests that bare the ark of the appointment of the LORD were ascended out of Jordan: as soon as the soles of the priests' feet were brought to dry land, the water of Jordan returned again to his place and went over all his banks as he did before.",

  "23": "For the LORD your God dried up the water of Jordan before you, until ye were over, as the LORD your God did unto the red sea, which he dried up before us till we were over,",
  "24": "that all the people of the world may know the hand of the LORD how mighty it is, and that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever."
