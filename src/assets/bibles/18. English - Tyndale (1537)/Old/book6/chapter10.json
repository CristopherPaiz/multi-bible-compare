  "1": "And when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Josua had taken Ai, and had destroyed it, and how that as he had done to Jericho and her king, even so he had done to Ai and her king, and how the Inhabiters of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and did remain among them:",
  "2": "then they feared exceedingly, for Gabaon was a great city, as any city of the kingdom, and thereto greater than Ai, and all her men were mighty.",
  "3": "Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Pharam king of Jerimoth, and unto Japhia king of Lachis, and unto Dabir king of Eglon saying:",
  "4": "Come up unto me and help me, that we may smite Gabaon: for they have made peace with Josua and the children of Israel.",
  "5": "Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon gathered themselves together, both they and all their hosts and went up and besieged Gabaon, and made war against it.",
  "6": "But the men of Gabaon sent unto Josua unto the host to Gilgal, saying: withdraw not thy hands from thy servants, but come up to us: for all the kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.",
  "7": "And Josua ascended from Gilgal, both he and all the people of war with him, and all the men of might,",
  "8": "and the LORD said unto Josua, fear them not, for I have delivered them unto thine hand, there shall not a man of them stand before thee.",
  "9": "And Josua came unto them suddenly, and journeyed from Gilgal all night.",
  "10": "And the LORD turmoiled(discomfited) them before Israel and slew of them a great slaughter at Gabaon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethoron and slew them till they came to Esaka and Makeda.",
  "11": "And as they fled from Israel, even in the going down to Bethoron, the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them, until they came unto Esaka, that they died. And there were more that died with hailstones, than the children of Israel slew with the sword.",
  "12": "Then spake Josua unto the LORD, the day when the LORD delivered the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of all Israel: Son stand thou still upon Gabaon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Aialon.",
  "13": "And the sun abode, and the moon stood still, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the righteous, how that the son abode in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down by the space of a whole day.",
  "14": "And there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the LORD obeyed the voice of a man: and all because the LORD fought for Israel.",
  "15": "And Josua returned and all Israel with him, unto the host to Gilgal:",
  "16": "but the five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at Makeda.",
  "17": "And it was told Josua, saying: the five kings are found hid in a cave at Makeda.",
  "18": "And Josua said, roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave and appoint men thereto, for to keep them.",
  "19": "And stand ye not still, but follow after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them. And suffer them not to enter into their cities, for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hands.",
  "20": "And when Josua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a great slaughter till they were wasted, yet there remained a certain of them, which entered into walled cities.",
  "21": "And all the people returned to the host, to Josua at Makeda in peace, so that no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.",
  "22": "Then said Josua: open the mouth of the cave, and bring out these five kings unto me out of the cave.",
  "23": "And they did so, and brought those five kings unto him, out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth the king of Lachis, and the king of Eglon.",
  "24": "And when they had brought out those kings unto Josua: Josua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war, which came with him, come near and put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them.",
  "25": "And Josua said unto them fear not nor dread: But be strong and pluck up your hearts, for so shall the LORD serve all your enemies against which ye fight.",
  "26": "And then Josua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees till evening.",
  "27": "And at the going down of the son, Josua gave commandment, and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave, where they hid themselves, and laid great stones on the cave's mouth, which remain unto this day.",
  "28": "And that same day Josua took Makeda, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof also, and utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, and let nought remain. And he did to the king of Makeda, as he did to the king of Jericho.",
  "29": "Then Josua went from Makeda, and all Israel with him unto Libna, and fought against Libna.",
  "30": "And the LORD delivered it also into their hands, with the king also and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein, and let nought remain in it, and did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.",
  "31": "After that Josua departed from Libna, and all Israel with him, unto Lachis, and besieged it, and assaulted it.",
  "32": "And the LORD delivered into the hands of Israel Lachis, that they took it the Second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he did to Libna.",
  "33": "Then Horam king of Geser came up to help Lachis: But Josua smote him and his people, until he left him nought remaining.",
  "34": "And from Lachis Josua departed, unto Eglon, and all Israel with him, and there besieged it, and assaulted it,",
  "35": "and took it the same day, and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein: and utterly destroyed them the same day, according to all that he did to Lachis.",
  "36": "Then Josua departed up from Eglon and all Israel with him, unto Hebron. And they fought against it,",
  "37": "and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the towns that pertained to it, and all the souls that were therein, so that they left nought remaining: but in all things as they did to Eglon, so they destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.",
  "38": "Then Josua returned and all Israel with him to Dabir, and they fought against it,",
  "39": "and took it, and the king thereof and all the towns that pertained thereto. And smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein, and let nought remain. And as he did to Hebron, so he did to Dabir, and the king thereof, and as he did to Libna and her king.",
  "40": "And Josua smote all the hill countries and the south countries, and the valleys, and the springs of water, with all their kings and let nought remain, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.",
  "41": "And Josua smote them from Cades Barne, unto Asah, and all the coasts of Gosan, even unto Gabaon.",
  "42": "And all those kings and their land, Josua took at one time: because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.",
  "43": "And then Josua returned and all Israel with him unto the host to Gilgal."
