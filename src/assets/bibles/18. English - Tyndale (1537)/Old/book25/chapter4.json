  "1": "Aleph. O how is the gold become so dim? How is the goodly colour of it so sore changed? and the stones of the sanctuary thus scattered in the corner of every street?",
  "2": "Beth. The children of Sion that were alway in honour, and clothed with the most precious gold: how are they now become like the earthen vessels which be made with the potters hand.",
  "3": "Gimel. The Lamies give their young ones suck with bare breasts: but the daughter of my people is cruel, and dwelleth in the wilderness: like the Ostriches.",
  "4": "Daleth. The tongues of the sucking children, cleave to the roof of their mouths for very thirst. The young children ask bread, but there is no man, that giveth it them.",
  "5": "He. They that were wont to fair delicately, perish in the streets: they that afore were brought up in purple, make now much of dung.",
  "6": "Vau. The sin of the daughter of my people is become greater than the wickedness of Sodom, that suddenly was destroyed, and not taken with hands.",
  "7": "Zain. Her abstainers (or Nazarees) were whiter than the snow or milk: their colour was fresh red as the Corall, their beauty like the Sapphire.",
  "8": "CHeth. But now their faces are very black: In so much, that thou shouldest not know them in the streets. Their skin cleaveth to their bones; It is withered, and become like a dry stock.",
  "9": "Teth. They that be slain with the sword, are happier than such as die of hunger, and perish away famishing for the fruits of the field.",
  "10": "Iod. The women (which of nature are pitiful) have sodden their own children with their hands that they might be their meat, in the miserable destruction of the daughter of my people.",

  "12": "Lamed. Neither the kings of the earth, nor all the inhabiters of the world, would have believed that the enemy and adversary should have come in at the gates of the city of Hierusalem.",
  "13": "Mem. Which nevertheless is come to pass for the sins of her prophets, and for the wickedness of her priests that have shed innocents blood within her.",
  "14": "Nun. So that these blind men went stumbling in the streets, and stained themselves with blood, which else would touch no bloody cloth.",
  "15": "Samech. But they cried unto every man: flee the staining, away, get you hence, touch it not. Yea (say they) ye must be brent, ye must dwell among the Gentiles, and bide no longer here.",
  "16": "Ain. The countenance of the LORD hath banished them, and shall never look more upon them: For they themselves neither regarded the priests, nor pitied the elders.",
  "17": "Phe. Wherefore yet our eyes fail us, while we look for vain help: seeing we be ever waiting upon a people, that can do us no good.",
