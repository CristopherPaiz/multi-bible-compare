  "1": "Aleph. Alas, how sitteth the city so desolate, that some time was full of people? How is she become like a widow, which was the lady of all nations? How is she brought under tribute, that ruled all lands.",
  "2": "Beth. She weepeth sore in the night, so that the tears run down her cheeks: for among all her lovers, there is none that giveth her any comfort: yea her next friends abhor her, and are become her enemies.",

  "4": "Daleth. The streets of Sion mourn, because no man cometh to the solempne feasts. All her gates are desolate, her priests make lamentation, her maidens are careful, and she herself is in great heaviness.",
  "5": "He. Her enemies are fallen upon her head, and have put her to shame: because the LORD hath chastened her for her great wickedness: her children are lead away captive before their enemy.",

  "13": "Mem. From above hath he sent down a fire into my bones and chastened me: he hath laid a net for my feet, and thrown me wide open: he hath made me desolate, so that I must ever be mourning.",
  "14": "Nun. The yoke of my transgression is come at the last, with his hand hath he taken it up, and put it about my neck. My strength is gone: the Lord(LORDE) hath delivered me into those hands, whereout I can not quite my self.",

  "21": "Sin. They hear my mourning, but there is none that will comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble, and are glad thereof, because thou hast done it. But thou shalt bring forth the time, when they also shall be like unto me.",
  "22": "Thau. From thee shall come all their adversity: thou shalt pluck them away, even as thou hast plucked me, because of all my wickedness. For my sorrow is very great, and my heart is heavy."
