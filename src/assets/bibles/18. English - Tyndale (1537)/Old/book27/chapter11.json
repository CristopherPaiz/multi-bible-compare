  "1": "And in the first year of Darius of Medea, I stood by him, to comfort him and to strength him,",
  "2": "and now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia, but the fourth shall be far richer than they all. And when he is in the chiefest power of his riches, he shall provoke every man against the realm of Greekland.",
  "3": "Then shall there arise yet a mighty king, that shall rule with great dominion, and do what him list.",
  "4": "And as soon as his kingdom cometh up, it shall be destroyed, and divided toward the four winds of the heaven. They that come after him, shall not have such power and dominion as he: but his kingdom shall be scattered, yea even among other than those.",
  "5": "And the king of the south shall be mightier, than his other princes. Against him there shall one make himself strong, and shall rule his dominion with great power.",
  "6": "But after certain years they shall be joined together, and the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the North, for to make friendship, but she shall not obtain the power of that arm, neither shall she be able to endure thorow his might: but she, and such as brought her, yea and he that begat her, and comforted her for his time, shall be delivered up.",
  "7": "Out of the branches of her root, there shall stand one up in his stead: which with power of armies shall go thorow the king's land of the north, and handle him according to his strength. As for their Idols and princes, with their costly Jewels of gold and silver,",
  "8": "he shall carry them away captives into Egypt, and he shall prevail against the king of the north certain years.",
  "9": "And when he is come into the king's realm of the south, he shall be fain to turn again in to his own land.",
  "10": "Wherefore his sons shall be displeased, and shall gather together a mighty great host of people: and one of them shall come, and go thorow like a water flood:(flowed) then shall he return, and go forth with defying and boasting(boosting) unto his own land.",
  "11": "Then the king of the south shall be angry, and shall come forth to fight against the king of the north: Yea he shall bring a great multitude of people together, and a great heap shall be given into his hand.",
  "12": "These shall he carry away with great pride, for so much as he hath cast down so many thousands, nevertheless he shall not prevail.",
  "13": "For the king of the north shall gather (of the new) a greater heap of people than afore, and come forth (after a certain time and years) with a mighty host and exceeding great good.",
  "14": "At the same time there shall many stand up against the king of the south, so that the wicked children of thy people also shall exalt themselves (to fulfill the vision) and then fall.",
  "15": "So the king of the north shall come to lay siege, and to take the strong fenced cities: And the power of them of the south shall not be able to abide him, and the best men of the people shall not be so strong, as to resist him.",
  "16": "Shortly, when he cometh, he shall handle him as he list, and no man shall be so hardy as to stand against him. He shall stand(stode) in the pleasant country, which thorow him shall be destroyed.",
  "17": "He shall set his face with all his power to obtain his kingdom, and to be like it. Yea that shall he do, and give him unto the daughters among women, to destroy him. But he shall fail, neither shall he obtain his purpose.",
  "18": "After this shall he set his face unto the Isles, and take many of them. A prince shall stop(stoppe) him, to do him a shame, beside the confusion that else shall come unto him.",
  "19": "Thus shall he turn again to his own land, stumble, and fall, and be no more found:",
  "20": "so that he that came upon him and did him violence, shall stand in his place, and have a pleasant kingdom: and after few days he shall be destroyed, and that neither in wrath, nor in battle.",
  "21": "In his stead there shall arise a vile person, not holden worthy of a king's dignity: this shall come in craftily, and obtain the kingdom with fair words:",
  "22": "he shall fight against the armies of the mighty (and destroy them) yea and against the prince of the covenant.",
  "23": "So after that he hath take truce with him, he shall handle deceitfully: that he may get up, and overcome him with a small flock:",
  "24": "and so with craftiness to get him to the fattest place of the land, and to deal otherwise, then either his fathers or grandfathers did. For he shall destroy the thing, that they had robbed and spoiled, yea and all their substance: imagining thoughts against the strong holds, and that for a time.",
  "25": "His power and heat shall be stirred up with a great army against the king of the south: where thorow the king of the south shall be moved then unto battle, with a great mighty host also. Nevertheless, he shall not be able to stand, for they shall conspire against him.",
  "26": "Yea they that eat of his meat, shall hurt him: so that his host shall fall, and many be slain down.",
  "27": "These two kings shall be minded to do mischief, and talk of deceit at one table: but they shall not prosper: for why, the end shall not come yet, unto the time appointed.",
  "28": "Then shall he go home again into his own land with great good, and set his heart against the holy covenant, he shall be busy against it, and then return home.",
  "29": "At the time appointed he shall come again, and go toward the south: So shall it happen otherwise then at the first, yet once again.",
  "30": "And why? the ships of Cithum shall come upon him, that he may be smitten and turn again: that he may take indignation against the covenant of holiness, to meddle against it. Yea he shall turn him, and draw such unto him, as leave the holy covenant.",
  "31": "He shall set mighty men to unhallow the Sanctuary of strength, and to put down the daily offering, and to set up the abominable desolation.",
  "32": "And such as break the covenant shall he flatter with fair words. But the people that will know their God, shall have the overhand and prosper.",
  "33": "Those also that have understanding among the people shall inform(enfourme) the multitude: and for a long season, they shall be persecuted with sword, with fire, with captivity and with the taking away of their goods.",
  "34": "Now when they fall, they shall be set up with a little help: but many shall cleave unto them fainedly.",
  "35": "Yea some of those which have understanding shall be persecuted also: that they may be tried, purified, and cleansed, till the time be out: for there is yet another time appointed.",
  "36": "The king shall do what him list, he shall exalt and magnify him self against all, that is God. Yea he shall speak marvelous things against the God of all gods, wherein he shall prosper, so long till the wrath be fulfilled, for the conclusion is devised already.",
  "37": "He shall not regard the God of his fathers, but his lust shall be upon women: Yea he shall not care for any God, for he shall magnify himself above all.",
  "38": "In his place shall he worship the mighty Idols: and the God whom his fathers knew not, shall he honour with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant jewels.",
  "39": "This shall he do, seeking help and succour at the mighty Idols and strange gods. Such as receive him, and take him for God, he shall give them great worship and power: yea and make them lords of the multitude, and give them the land with rewards.",
  "40": "In the latter time, shall the king of the south strive with him: and the king of the north in like manner shall come against him with chariots, horsemen and with a great navy of ships. He shall come into the lands, destroy and go thorow:",
  "41": "he shall enter also in to the fair pleasant land. Many cities and countries shall decay, except Edom, Moab and the best of the children of Ammon, which shall escape from his hand.",
  "42": "He shall stretch forth his hands upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape him.",
  "43": "For thorow his going in, he shall have dominion over the treasures of silver and gold, and over all the precious jewels of Egypt, Lybia and Ethiopia.",
  "44": "Nevertheless the tidings out of the East and the north shall trouble him, for the which cause he shall go forth to destroy and curse a great multitude.",
  "45": "The tents of his palace shall he pitch betwixt the two seas, upon the hill of the noble Sanctuary, for he shall come to the end of it, and then shall no man help him."
