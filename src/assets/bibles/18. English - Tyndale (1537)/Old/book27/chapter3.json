  "1": "Nabuchodonosor the king caused a golden Image to be made, which was sixty cubits high, and six cubits thick. This he made to be set up in the field of Dura, in the land of Babylon",
  "2": "and sent out to gather together the dukes, lords and nobles, the judges and officers, the deputies(debites) and shreves, with all the rulers of the land: that they might come to the dedication of the Image which Nabuchodonosor the king had set up.",
  "3": "So the dukes, lords and nobles, the judges and officers, deputies(debites) and shreves with all the rulers of the land gathered them together, and came unto the dedicating of the Image that Nabuchodonosor the king had set up. Now when they stood before the Image, which Nabuchodonosor had set up,",
  "4": "the bedel cried out with all his might: O ye people, kindreds and tongues, to you be it said:",
  "5": "that when ye hear the noise of the trumpets, which shall be blown, with harps, shawmes Psalteries, Symphonies and all manner of Music: ye fall down and worship the golden Image, that Nabuchodonosor the king hath set up.",
  "6": "Who so then falleth not down and boweth himself, shall even the same hour be cast in to an hot burning oven.",
  "7": "Therefore, when all the folk heard the noise of the trumpets, that were blown, with the harps, shawmes, Psalteries, Symphonies and all kind of Melody: then all the people, kindreds and nations fell down, and bowed themselves unto the golden Image, that Nabuchodonosor the king had set up.",
  "8": "Now were there certain men of the Caldees, that went even then and accused the Jews,",
  "9": "and said unto the king Nabuchodonosor: O king, God save thy life for ever.",
  "10": "Thou being king hast given a commandment, that all men when they hear noise of the trumpets, harps, shawmes psalteries, symphonies and all the other melodies: shall fall down and bow themselves toward the golden Image:",
  "11": "whoso then fell not down and worshipped not, that he should be cast in to an hot burning oven.",
  "12": "Now are there certain Jews, whom thou hast set over the offices of the land of Babylon: namely, Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago. These men, (O king) regard not thy commandment, yea they will not serve thy Gods, nor bow themselves to the golden Image, that thou hast set up.",
  "13": "Then Nabuchodonosor in a cruel wrath and displeasure, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago should be brought unto him. So these men were brought before the king.",
  "14": "Then Nabuchodonosor spake unto them, and said: what? O Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, will not ye serve my Gods? nor bow yourselves to the golden Image, that I have set up?",
  "15": "well, be ready hereafter, when ye hear the noise of the trumpets blow with the harps, shawmes psalteries, symphonies and all the other melodies: that ye fall down, and worship the Image which I have made. But if ye worship it not, ye shall be cast immediately in to an hot burning oven. Let see, what God is there, that may deliver you out of my hands?",
  "16": "Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, answered the king, an said: O Nabuchodonosor, we ought not to consent unto thee in this matter, for why:",
  "17": "our God whom we serve, is able to keep us from the hot burning oven (O king) and can right well deliver us out of thy hands:",
  "18": "And though he will not, yet shalt thou know (O king) that we will not serve thy Gods, nor do reverence to the Image, which thou hast set up.",
  "19": "Then was Nabuchodonosor full of indignation, so that the countenance of his face changed upon Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago. Therefore he charged and commanded, that the oven should be made seven times hotter, than it was wont to be:",
  "20": "and spake unto the strongest worthies that were in his house, for to bind Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, and to cast them in to the hot burning oven.",
  "21": "So these men were bound in their coats, hosen, shoes with their other garments, and cast in to the hot burning oven.",
  "22": "For the king's commandment was so straight, and the oven was exceeding hot. As for the men that put in Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, the flame of the fire destroyed them.",
  "23": "And these three men, Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago fell down in the hot burning oven, being fast bound.",
  "24": "Then Nabuchodonosor the king marveled, and stood up in all haste: he spake unto his counsel and said: did not ye cast these three men bound into the fire? They answered, and said unto the king: Yea O king.",
  "25": "He answered and said: Lo, for all that, yet do I see four men going loose(lowse) in the middest of the fire, and nothing corrupt: and the fourth is like an angel(the son of God) to look upon.",
  "26": "Upon this went Nabuchodonosor unto the mouth of the hot burning oven: he spake also, and said: O Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, ye servants of the high(hye) God: go forth, and come hither. And so Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, went out of the fire.",
  "27": "Then the dukes, lords and nobles, and the king's counsel came together to see these men, upon whom the fire had no manner of power in their bodies: in so much that the very hair of their head was not burnt, and their clothes unchanged: Yea there was no smell of fire felt upon them.",
  "28": "Then spake Nabuchodonosor, and said: Blessed be the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago: which hath sent his angel, and defended his servants, that put their trust in him: that have altered the king's commandment: and jeoperdy their bodies there upon: rather than they would serve or worship any other god, except their own God only.",
  "29": "Therefore I will and command, that all people, kindreds and tongues, which speak any blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, shall die and their houses shall be prised: Because, there is no God that may save, as this.",
  "30": "So the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, in the land of Babylon."
