  "7": "And when the letter came to them, they took the king's children and slew them in number, seventy persons, and put their heads in coffins and sent them to him to Jezrahel.",
  "8": "And there came a messenger and told him saying: they have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said: let them put them on two heaps in the entering of the gate, till it be day.",
  "9": "And in the morning he went out and stood and said to all the folk, ye be righteous: for see, I conspired against my master and slew him: But who slew these?",
  "10": "consider now how there is nothing of the LORD's word fallen to the earth, which he spake against the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that he spake to his servant Eliah.",

  "12": "And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. And as Jehu was come even to the house where the shepherds bind their sheep by the high way side,",

  "15": "And when he was departed thence he met with Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming against him. And Jehu saluted him and said to him: is thine heart right, as mine heart is with thine. And Jehonadab said, yea that it is. If it be, then give me thine hand. And he gave his hand, and the other took him up to him into the chariot",
  "16": "and said: go with me and see the zeal I have to the LORD, and made him ride with him in his chariot.",
  "17": "And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped him out, according to the saying of the LORD which he spake to Eliah.",
  "18": "After that Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them: Ahab served Baal a little: but Jehu shall serve him a good.",
  "19": "Now therefore call unto me all the Prophets of Baal and all his servants and all his priests that none be lacking. For I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal: and if any be missed, he shall not live. But Jehu did it for a subtlety, to destroy the servants of Baal.",
  "20": "Wherefore Jehu said: Appoint a solempne feast for Baal, and they proclaimed it.",
  "21": "Then Jehu sent thorowout all Israel. And all the servants of Baal came, that there was not a man left behind that came not. And when they were come into the temple of Baal, the temple was full from one end to another.",
  "22": "Then he said to the keeper of the vestry, bring forth garments for the servants of Baal. And he brought them out garments.",
  "23": "And Jehu went with Jehonadab son of Rechab into the house of Baal: and said to the servants of Baal: search and look that there be none here with you of the servants of the LORD, but the servants of Baal onely.",
  "24": "And they went in, to offer sacrifice and burnt offerings. But Jehu appointed him four score men without and said: If any of the men that I shall bring unto your hands escape, he that letteth him go shall die for him.",
  "25": "And as soon as he had made an end of offering of burnt sacrifice, he said to them of the guard and to the lords: go in and slay them, let none come out. And they smote them with the edge of the sword. And the guard and the lords cast them out, and went unto the city of the house of Baal,",
  "26": "and fetched out the image out of the house of Baal and burnt it.",
  "27": "And they brake the Image of Baal, and brake the house of Baal, and made a siege of it ever after.",
  "28": "And so Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.",
  "29": "But from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat which made Israel sin with the golden calves in Bethel and Dan, Jehu departed not.",
  "30": "Then the LORD said to Jehu, because thou hast lustily done that pleaseth me, and hast done to the house of Ahab all that was in mine heart, therefore shall thy children in the fourth generation sit on the seat of Israel.",

  "32": "In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short, for Hazael slew them in all the coasts of Israel,",
  "33": "from Jordan Eastward: even all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Rubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer upon the river of Arnon, with Gilead and Basan.",
  "34": "The rest of the acts of Jehu, and all he did, and all his power, are written in the chronicles of the kings of Israel.",
  "35": "And when Jehu was laid to rest with his fathers, they buried him in Samaria, and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.",
  "36": "And the time that Jehu reigned upon Israel in Samaria, was twenty eight year."
