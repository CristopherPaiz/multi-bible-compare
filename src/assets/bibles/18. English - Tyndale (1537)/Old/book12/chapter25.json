  "10": "And all the host of the Caldeyes that were with the chief Marshal brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.",
  "11": "And the rest of the people that were left in the city, and them that were fled to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people,",
  "12": "Nabusaradan the chief Marshal carried away, and left of the poor of the land to dress the vines and to till the ground.",
  "13": "And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD and the bottoms, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD the Caldeyes brake, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.",
  "14": "And the lavers, shovels, dressing knives, ladles, and the ministering vessels of brass, they carried away.",
  "15": "And the firepans, and basins that were either of gold or silver, them took the chief Marshal away",
  "16": "with the two pillars and the sea of brass and the bottoms which Salomon had made in the house of the LORD. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.",
  "17": "The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the head thereon was brass and three cubits long with a wreath and pomegranates round about upon the head, all of brass. And of the same fashion was the second pillar with a wreath.",
  "18": "And the chief Marshal took Saraiah the chief priest, and Zophoniah the highest priest save one, and three keepers of the door.",
  "19": "And out of the city he took a certain chamberlain that had the oversight of the men of war, and five men that were ever in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and Sopher the captain of the Host that taught the people of the land to make war, and three score men of the people of the land that were found in the city also.",
  "20": "And Nabusaradan the chief Marshal took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Reblah.",
  "21": "And the king of Babylon smote them and slew them at Reblah in the land of Hemath. And so Juda was carried away out of all their land.",
  "22": "And over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonozor king of Babylon left, he set Godoliah the son of Ahikam the son of Saphan.",
  "23": "And when all the captains of the men of war and the men heard that the king of Babylon had made Godoliah governor: there came to Godoliah to Mazphah: Ismael the son of Nathaniah and Johanan the son of Kareah and Saraiah the son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite and Jezoniah the son of Maachati and their men.",
  "24": "And Godoliah sware to them and to their men, and said to them: fear not ye the servants of the Caldeyes. But dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon and ye shall be in good condition.",
  "25": "But it chanced the seventh month after, that Ismael the son of Nathaniah the son of Elisama of the king's blood came, and ten men with him and smote Godoliah that he died: and so did he the Jews and the Caldeyes that were with him at Mazphah.",
  "26": "Thereupon all the people both small and great and the captains of the men of war arose and went to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Caldeyes.",
