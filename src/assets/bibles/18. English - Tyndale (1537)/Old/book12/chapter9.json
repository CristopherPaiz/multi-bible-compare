  "1": "And Eliseus the prophet called unto one of the children of the prophets, and said to him: gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and get thee to Ramoth in Gilead.",
  "2": "And when thou comest thither, thou shalt there see Jehu the son of Jehosaphat the son of Namsi and go to him, and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to a secret chamber.",
  "3": "And take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say, thus sayeth the LORD: I have anointed thee to be king over Israel. And then open the door and flee, and tarry not.",
  "4": "And the servant of the prophet got him to Ramoth in Gilead,",
  "5": "and when he came, the captains of the Host were sitting together. And he said: I have an errand to thee Sir captain. And Jehu said, unto which of all of us? And he said: to thee O captain.",
  "6": "And he arose and went into the house. And the other poured the oil on his head and said to him, thus sayeth the LORD God of Israel: I have anointed thee to be king over Israel the people of the LORD,",
  "7": "that thou slay the household of Ahab thy master. For I (sayeth the LORD) will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, of the hand of Jezabel",
  "8": "(for the whole house of Ahab shall be destroyed) and I will destroy unto Ahab what pisseth against the wall, and so much as the prisoned or that is forsaken in Israel,",
  "9": "and will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahiah.",
  "10": "And as for Jezabel the dogs shall eat her in the field of Jezrahel, and none shall bury her. And he opened the door and fled.",
  "11": "And when Jehu was come out to the servants of his lord, they said to him: is all peace? Wherefore came this mad fellow unto thee? And he said to him: ye know the person and his communication.",
  "12": "And they said: it is not so. But tell us a fellowship. And he said, thus and thus spake he to me saying: Thus sayeth the LORD: I have anointed thee to be king over Israel.",
  "13": "And they hasted and took every man his mantle and put under him on an high bench at the top of the steps, and blew a trumpet and said: Jehu is king.",
  "14": "And so Jehu the son of Jehosaphat the son of Namsi conspired against Jehoram. And Jehoram had been waiting at Ramoth Gilead, and all Israel with him for fear of Hazael king of Siria,",
  "15": "and was returned to be healed in Jezrahel, of the wounds which the Sirians had given him as he fought with Hazael king of Siria. Then said Jehu: If it be your minds, then let no man escape out of the city, to go and tell in Jezrahel.",
  "16": "And Jehu rode and went to Jezrahel: for Jehoram lay there, and Ohoziah king of Juda was come to Jehoram.",
  "17": "And the watchmen that stood on the tower in Jezrahel spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said: I see a company. And Jehoram said: take an horseman and send against them, and let him ask whether it be peace.",
  "18": "And there went one on horseback against him and said: thus sayeth the king: is it peace? And Jehu answered: what hast thou to do with peace? turn and come after me. And the watchman told saying: the messenger came to them but he cometh not again.",
  "19": "Then he sent out another on horseback, which came to them and said, thus sayeth the king: is it peace? And Jehu answered, what hast thou to do with peace? turn and come after me.",
  "20": "And the watchman told saying: he came to them, but he cometh not again, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Namsi, for he driveth as he were mad.",
  "21": "Then said Jehoram, make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Jehoram king of Israel, and Ohoziah king of Juda went out either in his chariot against Jehu, and met him in the furlong of Naboth the Jezrahelite.",
  "22": "And when Jehoram saw Jehu, he said: is it peace Jehu? And he said, what peace should there be, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezabel and her witchcrafts are so great?",
  "23": "And Jehoram turned his hand and fled, and said to Ohoziah: there is falsehood(treason) Ohoziah.",
  "24": "And Jehu took a bow in his hand and smote Jehoram between the shoulders, that the arrow came out at his breast. And he fell down three fold in his chariot.",
  "25": "Then he said to Badakar a lord of his, take and cast him in the plat of ground of Naboth the Jezrahelite. For I remember as I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, how the LORD spake these words against him:",
  "26": "I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and of his sons, said the LORD, and I will quite him in this ground, sayeth the LORD. Now therefore take him and cast him in the plat of ground according to the word of the LORD.",
  "27": "And when Ohoziah the king of Juda saw that, he fled the way to the garden house. And Jehu followed after him and said: smite him also. And they smote him in his chariot at the going up to Sur by Jeblaam, and he fled to Magedo and there died.",
  "28": "And his servants carried him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.",
  "29": "And in the eleventh year of Jehoram son of David, began Ohoziah to reign over Juda.",
  "30": "And when Jehu was come to Jezrahel, Jezabel heard of it, and starched her eyes and tired her head and looked out at a window.",
  "31": "And as Jehu entered at the gate she said: had Zamri peace which slew his master?",
  "32": "And he lifted up his eyes to the window and said, who is of my side who? And there looked out to him two or three lords that were chamberlains.",
  "33": "And he said: Throw her down. And they threw her down. And he sprinkled of her blood upon the walls and on the horses, and trod her under foot.",
  "34": "And then when he was come in and had eaten and drunk, he said: go and visit I pray you, yonder cursed creature, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.",
  "35": "And when they came to bury her, they found no more of her, than the skull and the two feet and the two hands.",
  "36": "And they came again and told him. And he said: it is the word of the LORD which he spake by the hand of his servant Eliah the Thesbite saying: in the field of Jezrahel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel,",
  "37": "and the carcass of Jezabel shall be dung upon the earth, in the field of Jezrahel, that men shall not say, this is Jezabel."
