  "9": "And the king of Israel took his journey with the king of Juda and the king of Edom. And when they had compassed the way seven days, there was no water for the host nor for the cattle that they had with them.",
  "10": "Then said the king of Israel: Alas, the LORD hath called together these three kings to deliver them into the hands of the Moabites.",
  "11": "But Jehosaphat said: is there here no prophet of the LORD's, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said: here is Eliseus the son of Saphat which poured water on the hands of Eliah. And Jehosaphat said:",

  "13": "And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: what have I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father and of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him: Oh nay, but hath the LORD called these three kings to deliver them into the hands of the Moabites?",
  "14": "And Eliseus said, as sure as the LORD of Hosts liveth (in whose sight I stand) and it were not that I regard the presence of Jehosaphat the king of Juda, I would not look toward thee, nor yet see ye.",

  "17": "For thus sayeth the LORD: ye shall see neither wind nor rain, and yet this brook shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, and your beasts and your cattle also.",
  "18": "And this is yet but a small thing in the sight of the LORD: But he will give the Moabites into your hands also.",
  "19": "And ye shall destroy all strong towns and all goodly cities, and shall fall all pleasant trees and stop(stoppe) all the wells of water, and mar all good plots of ground with stones.",

  "21": "And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come to fight against them, they gathered together, from the youngest that was able to put on harness and so upward, and waited in the borders.",

  "26": "And when the king of Moab saw, that the battle was so strong for him, he took with him seven hundredth men that drew the sword, to have broken up unto the king of Edom. But they could not.",
  "27": "And then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the walls. And there came so great wrath upon Israel, that they departed from him and returned to their own land."
