  "1": "Then we turned and went up the way to Basan. And Og the king of Basan came out against us: both he and all his people to battle at Edrei.",
  "2": "And the LORD said unto me: fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt deal with him as thou dealest with Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.",
  "3": "And so the LORD our God delivered into our hands, Og also the king of Basan and all his folk. And we smote him until nought was left him.",
  "4": "And we took all his cities the same season (for there was not a city which we took not from them) even three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Basan.",
  "5": "All these cities were made strong with high walls, gates and bars, beside unwalled towns a great many.",
  "6": "And we utterly destroyed them, as we played with Sihon king of Hesbon: bringing to nought all the cities with men, women and children.",
  "7": "But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities, we caught for ourselves.",
  "8": "And thus we took the same season, the land out of the hand of two kings of the Amorites on the other side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon",
  "9": "(which Hermon the Sidons call Sirion, but the Amorites call it Senir)",
  "10": "all the cities in the plain and all Gilead and all Basan unto Salcha and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.",
  "11": "For only Og king of Basan remained of the remnant of the giants: behold, his iron bed is yet at Rabath among the children of Ammon nine cubits long and, four cubits broad, of the cubits of a man.",
  "12": "And when we had conquered this land the same time, I gave from Aroer which is upon the river of Arnon, and half mount Gilead and the cities thereof unto the Rubenites, and Gadites.",
  "13": "And the rest of Gilead and all Basan the kingdom of Og, I gave unto the half tribe of Manasse: all the region of Argob with all Basan was called the land of giants.",
  "14": "Jair the son of Manasse took all the region of Argob unto the coasts of Gesuri and Maachati, and called the towns of Basan after his own name: the towns of Havoth Jair unto this day.",
  "15": "And I gave half Gilead unto Machir.",
  "16": "And unto Ruben and Gad, I gave from Gilead unto the river of Arnon and half the valley and the coast, even unto the river Jabock which is the border of the children of Ammon,",
  "17": "and the fields and Jordan with the coast, from Cenereth even unto the sea in the field which is the salt sea under the springs of Pisga eastward.",
  "18": "And I commanded you the same time (ye Ruben and Gad) saying: the LORD your God hath given you this land to enjoy it: see that ye go harnessed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are men of war among you.",
  "19": "Your wives only, your children and your cattle (for I wot that ye have much cattle) shall abide in your cities which I have given you,",
  "20": "until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you, and until they also have conquered the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then return again every man unto his possession which I have given you.",
  "21": "And I warned Josua the same time saying: thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings, even so the LORD will do unto all kingdoms whither thou goest.",
  "22": "Fear them not, for the LORD your God he it is that fighteth for you.",
  "23": "And I besought the LORD the same time saying:",
  "24": "O Lord Jehovah,(lorde Iehoua) thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand, for there is no God in heaven nor in earth that can do after thy works and after thy power:",
  "25": "let me go over and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly high country and Libanon.",
  "26": "But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and would not hear me, but said unto me, be content, and speak henceforth no more unto me of this matter;",
  "27": "Get thee up into the top of Pisga and lift up thine eyes west, north, south and east, and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.",
  "28": "Moreover, charge Josua and courage him and bold him. For he shall go over before his people, and he shall divide the land which thou shalt see unto them.",
  "29": "And so we abode in the valley beside Beth Peor."
