  "32": "And yet for all this saying ye did not believe the LORD your God",
  "33": "which goeth the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, that ye might see what way to go and in a cloud by day.",
  "34": "And the LORD heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swore saying,",
  "35": "there shall not one of these men of this froward generation see that good land which I sware to give unto your fathers,",

  "40": "But as for you, turn back and take your journey into the wilderness: even the way to the red sea.",

  "45": "And ye came again and wept before the LORD: but the LORD would not hear your voice nor give you audience.",
