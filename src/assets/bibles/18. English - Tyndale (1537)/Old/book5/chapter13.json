  "1": "If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give thee a sign or a wonder,",
  "2": "and that sign or wonder which he hath said come to pass, and then say: let us go after strange gods which thou hast not known, and let us serve them:",
  "3": "hearken not unto the words of that prophet or dreamer of dreams. For the LORD thy God tempteth you, to wete whether ye love the LORD your God with all your hearts and with all your souls.",
  "4": "For ye must walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and hearken unto his voice and serve him and cleave unto him.",
  "5": "And that prophet or dreamer of dreams shall die for it, because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt and delivered you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in: and so thou shalt put evil away from thee.",
  "6": "If thy brother the son of thy mother or thine own son or thy daughter or the wife that lieth in thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul unto thee, entice thee secretly saying: let us go and serve strange gods which thou hast not known nor yet thy fathers,",

  "12": "If thou shalt hear say of one of thy cities which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell in,",
  "13": "that certain being the children of Belial are gone out from among you and have moved the inhabiters of their city saying: let us go and serve strange gods which ye have not known.",
  "14": "Then seek and make search and enquire diligently. If it be true and the thing of a surety that such abomination is wrought among you:",
  "15": "then thou shalt smite the dwellers of that city with the edge of the sword, and destroy it merciless and all that is therein, and even the very cattle thereof with the edge of the sword.",
  "16": "And gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the streets thereof, and burn with fire: both the city and all the spoil thereof every whit unto the LORD thy God. And it shall be an heap for ever and shall not be built again.",
  "17": "And see that there cleave nought of the damned thing in thine hand, that the LORD may turn from his fierce wrath and shew thee mercy and have compassion on thee and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers:",
  "18": "when thou hast hearkened unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day so that thou do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God."
