  "1": "And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel",
  "2": "and said unto them: I am an hundred and twenty year old this day, and can no more go out and in. Also the LORD hath said unto me, thou shalt not go over this Jordan.",
  "3": "The LORD your God he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt conquer them. And Josua he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.",
  "4": "And the LORD shall do(go) unto them, as he did to Sehon and Og kings of the Amorites and unto their lands which kings he destroyed.",
  "5": "And when the LORD hath delivered them to thee, see that ye do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.",
  "6": "Pluck up your hearts and be strong, dread not nor be afeared of them: for the LORD thy God himself will go with thee, and will neither let thee go nor forsake thee.",
  "7": "And Moses called unto Josua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel. Be strong and bold, for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them, and thou shalt give it them to inherit.",
  "8": "And the LORD he shall go before thee and he shall be with thee, and will not let thee go nor forsake thee, fear not therefore nor be discomforted.",
  "9": "And Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi which bare the ark of the testament of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel,",
  "10": "and commanded them saying: At the end of seven year, in the time of the free year, in the feast of the tabernacles,",
  "11": "when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God, in the place which he hath chosen: see that thou read this law before all Israel in their ears.",
  "12": "Gather the people together: both men, women and children and the strangers that are in thy cities, that they may hear, learn and fear the LORD your God, and be diligent to keep all the words of this law,",
  "13": "and that their children which know nothing may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.",
  "14": "And the LORD said unto Moses: Behold thy days are come, that thou must die. Call Josua and come and stand in the tabernacle of witness, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Josua went and stood in the tabernacle of witness.",
  "15": "And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle: even in the pillar of the cloud. And the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.",
  "16": "And the LORD said unto Moses: behold, thou must sleep with thy fathers, and this people will go a whoring after strange gods of the land whither they go and will forsake me and break the appointment which I have made with them.",
  "17": "And then my wrath will wax hot against them, and I will forsake them and will hide my face from them, and they shall be consumed. And when much adversity and tribulation is come upon them, then they will say: because our God is not among us,",
  "18": "these tribulations are come upon us. But I will hide my face that same time for all the evil's sake which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto strange gods.",
  "19": "Now therefore write ye this song, and teach it the children of Israel and put it in their mouths that this song may be my witness unto the children of Israel.",
  "20": "For when I have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers that runneth with milk and honey, then they will eat and fill them selves and wax fat and turn unto strange gods and serve them and rail on me and break my testament.",
  "21": "And then when much mischief and tribulation is come upon them, this song shall answer before them, and be a witness. It shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about even now before I have brought them into the land which I sware.",
  "22": "And Moses wrote this song the same season, and taught it the children of Israel.",
  "23": "And the Lord(Lorde)(LORDE) gave Josua the son of Nun a charge and said: be bold and strong for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them, and I will be with thee.",
  "24": "When Moses had made an end of writing out the words of this law in a book unto the end of them",
  "25": "he commanded the Levites which bare the ark of the testament of the LORD saying:",
  "26": "take the book of this law and put it by the side of the ark of the testament of the LORD your God, and let it be there for a witness unto thee.",
  "27": "For I know thy stubbornness and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been disobedient unto the LORD: and how much more after my death.",
  "28": "Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them.",
  "29": "For I am sure that after my death, they will utterly mar them selves and turn from the way which I commanded you, and tribulation will come upon you in the latter days, when ye have wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD to provoke him with the works of your hands.",
  "30": "And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, unto the end of them."
