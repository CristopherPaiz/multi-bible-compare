  "3": "Then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and go and fetch thee again from all the nations, among which the LORD thy God shall have scattered thee.",

  "5": "and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt enjoy it. And he will shew thee kindness and multiply thee above thy fathers.",

  "13": "Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: who shall go over sea for us and fetch it us that we may hear it and do it.",

  "17": "But and if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear: but shalt go astray and worship strange gods and serve them,",
  "18": "I pronounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over Jordan to go and possess it.",
  "19": "I call to record this day unto you, heaven and earth, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: but choose life, that thou and thy seed may live,",
  "20": "in that thou lovest the LORD thy God, hearkenest unto his voice and cleavest unto him. For he is thy life and the length of thy days, that thou mayst dwell upon the earth which the LORD sware unto thy fathers: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give them."
