  "1": "After the death of Josua the children of Israel asked the LORD saying: Who shall go up first unto the Cananites to fight against them?",
  "2": "And the LORD said: Juda shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hands.",
  "3": "Then Juda said unto Simeon his brother: come with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Cananites: And I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. And so Simeon went with him.",
  "4": "And Juda went up, and the LORD delivered the Cananites and Pheresites into their hands. And they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.",
  "5": "And they found Adonibezek in Bezek. And they fought against him, and slew the Cananites and Pherisites.",
  "6": "But Adonibezek fled, and they followed after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.",
  "7": "Then Adonibezek said: three score and ten kings having their thumbs and great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table wherefore as I have done so God hath done to me again. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.",
  "8": "The children of Juda fought against Jerusalem and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.",
  "9": "And after that the children of Juda went even to fight against the Cananites that dwelt in the mountain, in the south, and in the low country.",
  "10": "And Juda went unto the Cananites that dwelt in Hebron, which before time was called Kariath Arbe. And slew Sesai, Ahiman and Thalmai.",
  "11": "And from thence they went to the inhabiters of Dabir, whose name in old time was called Kariathsepher.",
  "12": "And Caleb said: he that smiteth Kariathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Acsah my daughter to wife.",
  "13": "And Othoniel the son of Kenez Caleb's younger brother took it: to whom he gave Acsah his daughter to wife,",
  "14": "and as they went she counseled him to ask of her father a field. And then she lighted off her ass: and Caleb said unto her: What aileth thee?",
  "15": "She said unto him: give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a Southward and a dry land, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her springs both above and beneath.",
  "16": "And the children of the Kenite, Moses father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees, with the children of Juda, into the wilderness of Juda that lieth in the South of Arad, and dwelt among the people.",
  "17": "And Juda went and Simeon with him, and they slew the Cananites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it, and called the name of the city Hormah.",
  "18": "And Juda took Azah with the coasts thereof, and Askalon with the coasts thereof, and Akaron with the coasts thereof.",
  "19": "And the LORD was with Juda that he conquered the mountains, but they could not drive out the inhabiters of the valleys, because they had chariots of iron.",
  "20": "And they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses said. And he expelled thence the three sons of Enack.",
  "21": "And the children of BenJamin did not cast out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of BenJamin in Jerusalem unto this day.",
  "22": "And in like manner the house of Joseph went up to Bethel and the LORD with them,",
  "23": "and the house of Joseph searched out Bethel which before time was called Lus.",
  "24": "And the spies saw a man come out of the city and they said unto him shew us the way into the city. And we will shew thee mercy.",
  "25": "And he shewed them the way into the city, and they smote it with the edge of the sword, but let the man and all his household go free.",
  "26": "And the man went into the land of the Hethites, and built a city and called the name thereof Lus which is the name thereof unto this day.",
  "27": "Neither did Manasses expel Bethsean with her towns, neither Thaanach with her towns, neither the inhabiters of Dor with her towns, neither the inhabiters of Jeblaam with her towns, neither the inhabiters of Magedo with her towns, and so the Cananites went to and dwelt in the said land.",
  "28": "But as soon as Israel was waxed mighty, they put the Cananites to tribute: but expelled them not.",
  "29": "In like manner Ephraim expelled not the Cananites that dwelt in Gazer, but the Cananites dwelt still in Gazer among them.",
  "30": "Neither did Zabulon expel the inhabiters of Ketron, neither the inhabiters of Nahalol: but the Cananites dwelt among them and became tributaries.",
  "31": "Neither did Aser cast out the inhabiters of Acho, neither the inhabiters of Zidon, of Ahalab, Aczib, Halbah, Aphek, nor of Rohob,",
  "32": "but the Aserites dwelt among the Cananites the inhabiters of the land, and drave them not out.",
  "33": "Neither did Nephthalim drive out the enhabiters of Bethsames, nor the inhabiters of Bethanath, but dwelt amongst the Cananites the inhabiters of the land. Nevertheless the inhabiters of Bethsames, and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.",
  "34": "And the Amorites kept the children of Dan in the mountains, and suffered them not the come down to the valleys.",
  "35": "And so the Amorites went and dwelled in mount Heres in Hailon and in Salabim. Neverthelater the hand of Joseph waxed heavy upon them, so that they became tributaries.",
  "36": "And the coasts of the Amorites was from the going up to Acrabim, and from the rock upward."
