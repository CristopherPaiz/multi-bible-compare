  "1": "And the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bocim, and said, I brought you out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers. And I said that I would never break my appointment with you,",
  "2": "but ye should have made no covenant with the inhabiters of this land, ye should have broken down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye this done?",
  "3": "Wherefore I have likewise determined that I will not cast them out before you: abut they shall be in the sides of you, and their gods shall be snares unto you.",
  "4": "And when the angel of the LORD had spoken these words unto all the children of Israel, the people cried out and wept.",
  "5": "And called the name of the said place, Bocim, and offered there unto the LORD.",
  "6": "And when Josua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man into his inheritance to possess the land.",
  "7": "And the people served the LORD all the days of Josua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Josua, and had seen all the great works of the LORD that he did to Israel.",
  "8": "And Josua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died when he was an hundredth and ten years old:",
  "9": "whom they buried in the coasts of his inheritance: even in Thamnath hares in mount Ephraim on the north side of the hill Gaas.",
  "10": "And even so all that generation were put unto their fathers, and there arose another generation after them which neither knew the LORD, nor yet the works which he did unto Israel.",
  "11": "And then the children of Israel did wickedly in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim,",
  "12": "and forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange gods, even of the gods of the nations that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and angered the LORD.",
  "13": "And so they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Astharoth.",
  "14": "Wherefore the LORD waxed angry with Israel, and delivered them unto the hands of raveners to spoil them and sold them into the hands of their enemies round about them, so that they had no power any longer to stand before their enemies.",
  "15": "But unto whatsoever thing they went, the hand of the LORD was upon them with evil luck, even as the LORD promised them, and as he sware unto them. And they were sore vexed.",
  "16": "Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hands of their oppressors,",
  "17": "and yet for all that they would not hearken unto their judges: But went a whoring after strange gods and bowed themselves unto them, and turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD, and did not so.",
  "18": "And when the LORD raised them up judges, he was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hands of their enemies all the days of the judge: for the LORD had compassion over their sorrowings which they had by the reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them:",
  "19": "yet for all that as soon as the judge was dead they turned and did worse than their fathers in following strange gods, and in serving them, and ceased not from their inventions nor from their malicious ways.",
  "20": "Wherefore the LORD was angry with Israel and said: because this people hath transgressed mine appointment which I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice,",
  "21": "therefore henceforth I will not cast out one man before them of the nations which Josua left when he died,",
  "22": "and that to prove Israel through them whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein as their fathers did or not.",
  "23": "And so the LORD left those nations alone, and drove them not out immediately, neither delivered them into the hands of Josua."
