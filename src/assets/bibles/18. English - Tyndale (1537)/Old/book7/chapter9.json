  "31": "and sent messengers unto Abimelech privily saying: Behold Gaal the son of Abed and his brethren be come to Sichem: and behold they set the city against thee.",
  "32": "Now therefore up by night, both thou and all the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the fields.",
  "33": "And rise early in the morning as soon as the son is up and come upon the city. And when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, do to him what thine hands shall be able.",
  "34": "And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night. And they laid await to the city in four companies.",
  "35": "And Gaal the son of Abed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up and the folk that were with him, from lying await.",
  "36": "And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: Behold there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him: the shadow of the hills seem men unto thee.",
  "37": "And Gaal answered again and said: see there come folk down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the charmer's Oak.",
  "38": "Then said Zebul unto him: where is now thy mouth that said, what fellow is Abimelech, that we should serve him. These are the people that thou so despisest. Go out now a fellowship and fight with them.",
  "39": "And Gaal went out before the citizens of Sichem, and fought with Abimelech.",
  "40": "And Abimelech chased him that he fled before him and many were overthrown and slain, even until they came unto the entering of the gate.",
  "41": "And then Abimelech went and dwelt at Arumah. And then Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, and would not suffer them to dwell in Sichem.",
  "42": "And on the morrow the people went out into the field. And it was told Abimelech.",
  "43": "And he took his people and divided them into three companies and lay await in the fields. And when he saw that the people were come out of the city, he ran upon them and laid upon them.",
  "44": "And Abimelech and the companies that were with him, ran and stood in the entering of the gate of the city. And the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them.",
  "45": "And then Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and took it, and slew the people that were therein, and destroyed the city and sowed salt in the place.",
  "46": "And when all the men of the town of Sichem heard that, they entered into a stronghold of the house of their god Baal Berith.",
  "47": "And when it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Sichem were gathered together,",
  "48": "he gat him to mount Zelmon, both he and all that were with him, and took axes with him and cut down an arm of a tree, and took it up, and put it on his shoulder, and said unto the folk that were with him, whatsoever ye see me do: speed yourselves and do likewise.",
  "49": "And all the people cut down also every man a bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them into the hold, and set the hold a fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of Sichem were slain, upon a thousand persons what of men and women together.",
  "50": "Then went Abimelech to Thebes and besieged it and took it.",
  "51": "But there was a strong tower in the midst of the city, and thither ran all the men and women and all the citizens of the city and shut it to them, and got them up upon the top of the tower.",
  "52": "Then came Abimelech unto the tower and fought against it, and went hard unto the entering of the gate, to set it on fire.",
  "53": "But a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon his head and all to brake his brain pan.",
  "54": "Then Abimelech called hastily unto the young man that bare his harness, and said unto him: draw thy sword and slay me, that men say not of me, a woman slew him. And his lad thrust him thorow and he died.",
  "55": "And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man unto his own house.",
  "56": "And thus all the wickedness of Abimelech which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren,",
  "57": "and thereto all the wickedness of the men of Sichem, God did bring upon their heads: And upon them came the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal."
