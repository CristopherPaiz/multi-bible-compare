  "1": "Samson went down to Thamnath, and saw a woman in Thamnath of the daughters of the Philistines,",
  "2": "and came up and told his father and his mother, and said: I have seen a woman in Thamnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And now give her me to wife.",
  "3": "Then his father and mother said unto him, is there never a woman of the daughters of thy brethren, among all my people: but that thou must go and fetch a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, give me this woman for she pleaseth me well.",
  "4": "But his father and mother wist(knew) not that it was the LORD's doing, and that he sought an occasion of the Philistines, which at that time reigned over Israel.",
  "5": "Then went Samson and his father and his mother down to Thamnath. And when they came to the vineyards of Thamnath: behold a young lion roared upon him.",
  "6": "And the spirit of the LORD came upon him. And he tare him, as a man would rent a Kid, and yet had nothing in his hand. Nevertheless he told not his father and mother what he had done.",
  "7": "And he went down and talked with the woman, which seemed well favoured in the sight of Samson.",
  "8": "And within a short space after, as he went thither again to take her to wife, he turned out of the way, to see the carcase of the Lion. And behold there was a swarm of bees in the carcase of the Lion and honey.",
  "9": "And he took of the honey in his hands and went eating, and came to his father and mother, and gave them also. And they did eat. But he told not them, that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the Lion.",
  "10": "And when his father was come unto the woman, Samson made there a feast, for so used the young men to do.",
  "11": "And when her friends saw him, they brought thirty companions to bear fellowship.",
  "12": "And Samson said unto them: I will put forth a riddle unto you. And if you can declare it within seven days of the feast and find it out, I will give you thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments:",
  "13": "But and if you can not declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments. And they answered him, put forth thy riddle and let us hear it.",
  "14": "And he said unto them: Out of the eater came meat: and out of the strong came sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.",
  "15": "And when the seventh day was come, they said unto Samson's wife; Flatter with thine husband, that he may declare us thy riddle, or else we will burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to make us beggars or not?",
  "16": "Then Samson's wife wept unto him and said, it can not be but that thou hatest me and lovest me not: for thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my folk and wilt not tell me what it meaneth. And he said: Behold, I have not told it my father, nor my mother, and should I tell it thee?",
  "17": "And she wept unto him seven days, while the feast lasted. And the seventh day he told her, because she lay so sore upon him. And she told it the children of her folk.",
  "18": "And the men of the city said unto him the seventh day before the son went down; What is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a Lion. Then said he unto them: If ye had not ploughed with my calf, ye had not found out my riddle.",
  "19": "Then the spirit of the LORD came upon him. And he went down to Askalon, and slew thirty men of them and spoiled them, and gave their garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And he was wroth and went up to his father's house.",
  "20": "But Samson's wife was given to one of his companions that bare him company."
