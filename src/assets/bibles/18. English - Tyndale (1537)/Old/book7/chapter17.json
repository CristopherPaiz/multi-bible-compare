  "1": "There was a man in mount Ephraim, named Micah",
  "2": "which said unto his mother: the eleven hundredth silverlings that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst and saidst in mine ears: Behold the silver is with me for I took it away. Then said his mother, blessed be thou my son, in the LORD.",
  "3": "And so he restored the eleven hundredth silverlings to his mother again. And his mother said: I vowed the silver unto the LORD of mine hand for my son: to make a graven image and an image of metal. Now therefore I give it thee again.",
  "4": "And he restored the money again unto his mother. Then his mother took two hundredth silverlings and put them to a goldsmith, to make thereof a graven image and a image of metal, which remained in the house of Micah.",
  "5": "And the man Micah had a chapel of gods, and made an Ephod and images, and filled the hand of one of his sons which became his priest.",
  "6": "For in those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did what thought him best.",
  "7": "And there was a young man out of Bethlehem Juda, and out of the kindreds of Juda: which young man was a Levite and sojourned there.",
  "8": "And the man departed out of the city of Bethlehem Juda, to go dwell where he could find a place. And he came to mount Ephraim, and to the house of Micah as he journeyed.",
  "9": "And Micah said unto him, whence comest thou? and the Levite answered him: I am of Bethlehem Juda, and go to dwell where I may find a place.",
  "10": "And Micah said unto him: dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest. And I will give thee ten silverlings by year and raiment of all sorts, and thy meat and drink.",
  "11": "And the Levite went and began to dwell with the man, and was unto him as dear as one of his own sons.",
  "12": "And Micah filled the hand of the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and continued in the house of Micah.",
  "13": "Then said Micah, now I am sure that the LORD will be good unto me, seeing I have a Levite to my priest."
