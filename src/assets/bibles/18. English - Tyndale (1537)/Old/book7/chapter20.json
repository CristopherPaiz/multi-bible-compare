  "24": "And the LORD said: go up unto them and when the children of Israel were come to the children of Benjamin the second day,",

  "35": "And the LORD plagued Benjamin before Israel, so that the children of Israel destroyed in Benjamin the same day twenty five thousand and an hundredth men, that drew swords every one of them.",
  "36": "It seemed the children of Benjamin, that the other had been put to the worse. For the men of Israel gave Rome to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the layers in wait which they had laid against Gabaah.",
  "37": "And the layers in wait hasted and ran upon Gabaah, and went and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.",
  "38": "And the appointment of the men of Israel with the layers in wait to run upon Benjamin with the sword, was when they should make the smoke rise up out of the city.",
