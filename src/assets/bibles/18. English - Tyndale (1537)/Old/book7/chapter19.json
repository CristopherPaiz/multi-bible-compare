  "1": "It chanced in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, took to wife a concubine out of Bethlehem Juda:",
  "2": "which concubine played the whore in his house, and went away from him, unto her father's house to Bethlehem Juda, and there continued four months.",
  "3": "And her husband arose and went after her, to speak friendly, unto her, and to bring her home again, and his lad with him and a couple of Asses. And she brought him unto her father's house, and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced of his coming.",
  "4": "And his father-in-law the damsel's father kept him that he abode with him three days and so they ate and drank and lodged there.",
  "5": "The fourth day they arose early in the morning, and the man stood up to depart. But the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and then go your way.",
  "6": "And they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together. Then said the damsel's father unto the man, go to I pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry.",
  "7": "How be it the man stood up to depart: but his father-in-law compelled him to turn again and to tarry all night there.",
  "8": "And he rose up early the fifth day to depart. Then said the damsel's father comfort thine heart: and so made him tarry until after midday. And they did eat both of them together.",
  "9": "And then the man arose to depart with his concubine and his lad. But his father-in-law the damsel's father said unto him behold the day goeth fast away and draweth toward even, tarry all night: at the least way tarry this day here and let thine heart be merry. And tomorrow get you early upon your way and get thee to thy tent.",
  "10": "Neverthelater the man would not tarry, but arose and departed and came as far as Jebus, which is Jerusalem, and his two asses laden, and his concubine, and his lad with him.",
  "11": "And when they were fast by Jebus, the day was sore spent and the young man said unto his master, come I pray thee and let us turn in, into this city of the Jebusites and lodge all night there.",
  "12": "But his master said unto him, we will not turn in to a strange city that are not of the children of Israel: we will go forth to Gabaah.",
  "13": "And he said unto his lad, go forward, and we shall come to one place or other and shall lodge all night in Gabaah or in Ramah.",
  "14": "And they went forward upon their way, and the son went down upon them when they were fast by Gabaah which is in Benjamin.",
  "15": "And they turned thitherward to go and lodge all night in Gabaah. And when they came in, they sat them down in a street of the city, for there was no man took them in to lodge.",
  "16": "But behold there came an old man from his work, out of the fields at even which was also of mount Ephraim, and but a stranger in Gabaah, for the men of the place were of the children of Jemini.",
  "17": "And when he had lifted up his eyes, and saw a wayfaring man in the streets of the city he said: whither goest thou? And whence comest thou?",
  "18": "And the other answered him, we come from Bethlehem Juda toward the side of mount Ephraim: from thence am I, and went to Bethlehem Juda and go now to the house of the LORD. But there is no man that receiveth me to house:",
  "19": "and yet I have straw and provender for our Asses, and bread and wine for me and thy handmaid, and thy lad that are with thy servant, and lack nothing.",
  "20": "The old man said, peace be with thee, all that thou lackest shalt thou find with me: onely abide(tarry) not in the streets all night,",
  "21": "and he brought him into his house, and gave fodder unto his Asses. And they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.",
  "22": "And as they were making their hearts merry, the men of the city which were wicked, set the house round about, and thrust at the door, and spake to the man of the house, the old man saying: bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.",
  "23": "But the man of the house went out to them and said unto them, Oh, nay my brethren, do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house: do not this folly.",
  "24": "Behold my daughter a maiden and this man's concubine, them I will bring out unto you, and humble them, and do with them what seemeth you good: but unto this man, do not this folly.",
  "25": "But the men would not hearken to him. Nevertheless the man took his concubine and brought her out unto them, and they had to do with her, and entreated her shamefully, all the night even unto the morning. And when the day began to spring, they let her go.",
  "26": "And then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man's house, where her lord was, and there she lay till day.",
  "27": "And her lord arose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way. And behold, his concubine lay along before the door of the house, and her hand upon the threshold.",
  "28": "And he said unto her: up and let us be going. But she answered not. Then he took her up upon an ass and stood up and gat him unto his own home.",
  "29": "And when he was come unto his house, he took a dressing knife, and caught his concubine and divided her thorow the bones into twelve pieces, and sent her into all quarters of Israel.",
  "30": "And all that saw it said: there was no such deed done or seen since the children of Israel came out of Egypt unto this day, consider the matter, give counsel and say your minds."
