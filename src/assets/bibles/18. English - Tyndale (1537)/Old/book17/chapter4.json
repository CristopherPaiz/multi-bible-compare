  "1": "When Mardocheus perceived all that was done, he rent his clothes, and put on sack cloth, and ashes, and went out into the midst(middes) of the city, and cried loud and lamentably,",
  "2": "and came before the king's gate: for there might no man enter within the king's gate, that hath(had a) sack cloth on.",
  "3": "And in all lands and places, as far as the king's word and commandment extended, there was great lamentation among the Jews and many fasted, wept, mourned and lay in sack clothes and in ashes.",
  "4": "So Esther's damsels and her chamberlains, came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly astonied. And she sent raiment, that Mardocheus should put them on, and lay the sackcloth from him. But Mardocheus would not take them.",
  "5": "Then called Esther Hathath one of the king's chamberlains (which stood before her) and gave him a commandment to Mardocheus, that he might know what it were, and wherefore he did so.",
  "6": "So Hathath went forth to Mardocheus unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.",
  "7": "And Mardocheus told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of silver that Haman had promised to weigh down in the king's chamber because of the Jews, for to destroy them.",
  "8": "And he gave him the copy of the commandment, that was devised at Susan to destroy them, that he might shew it unto Esther, and to speak to her and charge her, that she should go into the king, and make her prayer and supplication unto him for her people.",

As for me, I have not been called to come in to the king now this thirty days.",
  "12": "And when Mardocheus was certified of Esther's words,",
  "13": "Mardocheus bade say again unto Esther: think not to save thine own life, while thou art in the king's house before all Jews:",
  "14": "for if thou holdest thy peace at this time, then shall the Jews have help and deliverance out of another place, and thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom, for this time's sake?",
  "15": "Esther bade, give Mardocheus this answer:",
  "16": "Go thou thy way then, and gather together all the Jews that are found at Susan, and fast ye for me, that ye eat not and drink not in three days, neither day nor night. I and my damsels will fast likewise, and so will I go in to the king contrary to the commandment: if I perish, I perish.",
  "17": "So Mardocheus went his way, and did all that Esther had commanded him."
