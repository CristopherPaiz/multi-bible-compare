  "1": "And when the king and Haman came to banquet that queen Esther had prepared,",
  "2": "the king said unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine:(whan he had droken wyne:) What is thy petition queen Esther, that it may be given thee? And what requirest thou? Yea, ask even half of the empire, and it shall be done.",
  "3": "Esther the queen answered and said: If I have found grace in thy sight, (O king) and if it please the king, then grant me my life at my desire and my people for my petition's sake:",
  "4": "for we are sold, I and my people both to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold to be bondmen and bondwomen, then would I hold my tongue, so should not the enemy be so high to the king's harm.",
  "5": "The king Ahasuerus spake and said unto queen Esther: What is he that? Or where is he that dare presume in his mind to do such a thing after that manner?",
  "6": "Esther said: The enemy and adversary is this wicked Haman. As for Haman, he was exceedingly afraid before the king and the queen.",
  "7": "And the king arose from the banquet and from the wine in his displeasure and went in to the palace garden. And Haman stood up, and besought queen Esther for his life: for he saw that there was a mischance prepared for him of the king already.",
  "8": "And when the king came again out of the palace garden into the parlor where they had eaten, Haman had laid him upon the bed that Esther sat upon. Then said the king; Will he force the queen also beside me in the house? As soon as that word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.",
  "9": "And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that stood before the king, said: Behold, there standeth a gallows in Haman's house fifty cubits high, which he had made for Mardocheus, that spake good for the king. The king said: hang him thereon.",
  "10": "So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had made for Mardocheus. Then was the king's wrath pacified.(stilled)"
