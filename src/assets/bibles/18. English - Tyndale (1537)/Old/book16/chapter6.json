  "2": "Sanabalat and Gesem sent unto me, saying: come and let us meet together in the villages upon the plain of the city Ono. Nevertheless they thought to do me evil.",

  "7": "and hast ordained the Prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, and to say: He is king of Judah. Now shall this come to the king's ears: come now therefore, and let us take our counsel together.",
  "8": "Nevertheless I sent unto him saying: there is no such thing done as thou sayest: thou hast feigned it out of thine own heart.",

  "17": "And at the same time were there many of the chief of Juda, whose letters went unto Tobiah, and from Tobiah unto them,",
