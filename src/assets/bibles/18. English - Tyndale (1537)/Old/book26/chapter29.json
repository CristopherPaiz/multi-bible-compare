  "1": "In the tenth year, upon the twelfth day of the tenth Month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "O thou son of man, set now face against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, Prophesy against him and against the whole land of Egypt:",
  "3": "Speak, and tell him, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) behold, O Pharaoh thou king of Egypt, I will upon thee, thou great dragon,(whall fysh) that liest in the(yi) waters: thou that sayest: the water is mine. I have made it myself.",
  "4": "I will put an hook in thy chaws, and hang all the fish in thy waters upon thy scales. after that I will draw thee out of thy waters, yea and all the fish of the waters that hang upon thy scales.",
  "5": "I will cast thee out upon the dry land with the fish of thy waters, so that thou shalt lie upon the field. Thou shalt not be gathered nor taken up: but shall be meat for the beasts of the field, and for the fowls of the air:",
  "6": "that all they which dwell in Egypt, may know, that I am the LORD: because thou hast been a staff of rede to the house of Israel.",
  "7": "When they took hold of thee with their hand thou breakest and prickest them on every side: and if they leaned upon thee, thou brakest and hurtest the reynes of their backs.",
  "8": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and root out of thee both man and beast.",
  "9": "Yea the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste, and they shall know, that I am the LORD: Because he said: The water is mine, I myself have made it.",
  "10": "Behold therefore, I will upon thee, and upon thy waters: I will make the land of Egypt waste and desolate, from the tower of Syenes unto the borders of the Morians land:",
  "11": "so that in forty years there shall no foot of man walk there, neither foot of cattle go there, neither shall it be inhabited.",
  "12": "I will make the land of Egypt to be desolate, among other waste countries, and her cities to lie void forty years, among other void cities: And I will scatter the Egyptians among the Heathen and nations.",
  "13": "Again, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) When the forty years are expired I will gather the Egyptians together again, out of the nations, among whom they were scattered,",
  "14": "and will bring the prisoners of Egypt again into the land of Pathures their own native country, that they may be there a lowly small kingdom:",
  "15": "Yea they shall be the smallest among the other kingdoms, lest they exalt themselves above the Heathen, for I will so minish them,",
  "16": "that they shall no more rule the Heathen. They shall no more be an hope unto the house of Israel, neither provoke them any more to wickedness, to cause them turn back, and follow them: and they shall know, that I am the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "17": "In the twenty seventh year, the first day of the first Month, came the word of the LORD unto me, saying:",
  "18": "O thou son of man, Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon hath made his host, with great travail and labour to come before Tyre: that every head may be bald, and every shoulder bare. Yet hath Tyre given neither him nor his host any reward, for the great travail that he hath taken there.",
  "19": "Therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, that he may take away all her substance, rob her robberies, and spoil her spoils, to pay his host their wages withal.",
  "20": "I will give him the land of Egypt for his labour, that he took for me before Tyre.(For the work which he wrought about it, I have given him the land of Egypt, because they wrought for me, sayth the Lord GOD.)",
  "21": "At the same time will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to grow forth, and open thy mouth again among them: that they may know, how that I am the LORD."
