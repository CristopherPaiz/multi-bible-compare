  "1": "The word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "Thou son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, prophesy upon them,",
  "3": "and say unto the Ammonites: hear the word of the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) For so much as thou speakest over my Sanctuary. A ha, I trow it be now suspended: and over the land of Israel, I trow it be now desolate: yea and over the house of Judah, I trow they be now led away prisoners:",
  "4": "Behold, I will deliver thee to the people of the east, that they may have thee in possession: these shall set their castles and houses in thee. They shall eat thy fruit, and drink up thy milk.",
  "5": "As for Rabbah, I will make of it a stall for camels, and of Ammon a sheepfold: and ye shall know, that I am the LORD.",
  "6": "For thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) In so much as thou hast clapped with thine hands, and stamped with thy feet, yea rejoiced in thine heart over the land of Israel with despite:",
  "7": "behold, I will stretch out mine hand over thee also, and deliver thee, to be spoiled of the Heathen, and root thee out from among the people, and cause thee to be destroyed out of all lands: yea I will make thee be laid waste, that thou mayest know, that I am the LORD.",
  "8": "Thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) For so much as Moab and Seir do say: As for the house of Judah, it is but like as all other Gentiles be:",

  "10": "These will I open unto them of the east, that they may fall upon the Ammonites: and will give it them in possession: so that the Ammonites shall no more be had in remembrance among the Heathen.",
  "11": "Even thus will I punish Moab also, that they may know, how that I am the LORD.",
  "12": "Moreover, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Because that Edom hath avenged and eased himself upon the house of Judah,",

  "15": "Thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) For so much as the Philistines have done this: namely taken vengeance with despiteful stomachs, and of an old evil will set themselves to destroy:",
  "16": "Therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Behold, I will stretch out mine hand over the Philistines, and destroy the destroyer, and cause all the remnant of the sea coast to perish.",
  "17": "A great vengeance will I take upon them, and punish them cruelly: that they may know, how that I am the LORD, which have avenged me of them."
