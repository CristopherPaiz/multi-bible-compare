  "1": "He cried also with a loud voice in mine ears, saying: Come her ye rulers of the city, every man with his weaponed hand to the slaughter.",
  "2": "Then came there six men out of the street of the upper port toward the north, and every man a weapon in his hand to the slaughter. There was one amongst them, that had on him a linen(lining) rayment, and a writer's inkhorn by his side. These went in, and stood beside the brazen alter:",

  "10": "Therefore will I upon them, mine eye shall not oversee them, neither will I spare them, but will recompense their wickedness upon their heads.",
  "11": "And behold, the man that had the linen(lining) rayment upon him, and the writers inkhorn by his side: told all the matter how it happened, and said: Lord,(LORDE) as thou hast commanded me, so have I done."
