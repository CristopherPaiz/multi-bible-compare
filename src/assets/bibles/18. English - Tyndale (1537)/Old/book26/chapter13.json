  "1": "The word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "Thou son of man, speak prophecy against those prophets, that preach in Israel: and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts: Hear ye the word of the LORD,",
  "3": "thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Woe be unto those foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and speak where they see nothing.",
  "4": "O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes upon the dry field:",
  "5": "For they stand not in the gaps, neither made they an hedge for the house of Israel, that men might abide the peril in the day of the LORD.",
  "6": "Vain things they see, and tell lies, to maintain their preachings withal. The LORD (say they) hath spoke it, when in very deed the LORD hath not sent them.",
  "7": "Vain visions have ye seen, and spoken false prophesies, when ye say: the LORD hath spoken it where as I never said it.",
  "8": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Because your words be vain, and ye seek out lies: Behold, I will upon you, sayeth the LORD.",
  "9": "Mine hands shall come upon the prophets, that look out vain things, and preach lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor written in the book of the house of Israel, neither shall they come in the land of Israel: that ye may know, how that I am the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "10": "And that for this cause: they have deceived my people, and told them of peace, where no peace was. One setteth up a wall, and they daub it with loose(lowse) clay.",
  "11": "Therefore tell them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall. For there shall come a great shewer of rain, great stones shall fall upon it, and a sore storm of wind shall break it,",
  "12": "so shall the wall come down. Shall it not then be said unto you: where is now the mortar, that ye daubed it withal?",
  "13": "Therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) I will break out in my wrothfull displeasure with a stormy wind, so that in mine anger there shall come a mighty shewer of rain, and hailstones in my wrath, to destroy withal.",
  "14": "As for the wall, that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, I will break it down, make it even with the ground: so the foundation thereof shall remove, and it shall fall, yea and ye yourselves shall perish in the middest thereof: to learn you for to know, that I am the LORD.",
  "15": "Thus will I perform my wrath upon this wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and then will I say unto you: The wall is gone, and the daubers are away.",
  "16": "These are the prophets of Israel, which prophesy unto the city of Jerusalem, and look out visions of peace for them, where as no peace is, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "17": "Wherefore (O thou son of man) set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own hearts: and speak thou prophecy against them,",
  "18": "and say: Thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Woe be unto you, that sew(sowe) pillows under all armholes, and bolsters under the heads both of young and old, to catch souls withal. For when ye have gotten the souls of my people in your captivity, ye promise them life,",
  "19": "and dishonour me to my people, for an handful of barley, and for a piece of bread: when ye kill the souls of them, that die not, and promise life to them, that live not: Thus ye dissemble with my people, that believeth your lies.",
  "20": "Wherefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Behold, I will also upon the pillows, wherewith ye catch the souls in flying: them will I take from your arms, and let the souls go, that ye catch in flying.",
  "21": "Your bolsters also will I tear in pieces, and deliver my people out of your hand: so that they shall come no more in your hands to be spoiled, and ye shall know, that I am the LORD.",
  "22": "Seeing that with your lies ye discomfort the heart of the righteous, whom I have not discomforted: Again: For so much as ye courage the hand of the wicked, so that he may not turn from his wicked way, and live:",
  "23": "therefore shall ye spy out no more vanity, nor prophesy your own guessings: for I will deliver my people out of your hand, that ye may know, how that I am the LORD."
