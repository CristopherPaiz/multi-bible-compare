  "5": "So a wind took me up, and brought me into the innermer court: and behold, the house was full of the glory of the LORD.",

Thus have they defiled my holy name with their abominations, that they have committed. Wherefore I have destroyed them in my wrath:",
  "9": "But now they shall put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings out of my sight, that I may dwell among them for evermore.",

  "15": "The altar was four cubits high, and from the altar upward stood four horns,",
  "16": "and it was twelve cubits long and twelve cubits broad, upon the four corners:",
  "17": "the covering of the altar was fourteen cubits long and broad upon the four corners, and the ledge that went round about, had half a cubit: and the bottom thereof round about one cubit: his steps stood toward the East.",

  "21": "Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and burn him in a several place without the Sanctuary.",
  "22": "The next day, take a gootbuck without blemish for a sin offering, to reconcile the altar withal: like as it was reconciled with the bullock.",
  "23": "Now when thou hast made it clean, then offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish also.",
