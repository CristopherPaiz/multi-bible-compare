  "1": "O Thou son of man, take thee then a sharp knife, namely, a razor. Take that, and shave the hair of thy head and beard: Then take the scales and weight, and divide the hair asunder.",
  "2": "And burn the third part thereof in the fire in the middest of the city, and cut the other third part in pieces with a knife. As for the third part that remaineth, cast it in the wind, and then shew the bare knife.",
  "3": "Yet afterward take a little of the same, and bind it in thy coat lap.",
  "4": "Then take a curtesy of it, and cast it in the middest of the fire: and burn it in the fire. Out of the same fire shall there go a flame, upon the whole house of Israel.",
  "5": "Moreover, thus said the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) This same is Jerusalem. I set her in the middest of the Heathen and nations: that are round about her,",
  "6": "but she hath despised my judgements more than the Gentiles themselves, and broken my commandments more than the nations, that lie round about her: For they have cast out mine ordinances, and not walked in my laws.",
  "7": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) For so much as ye with your wickedness far exceed the Heathen, that dwell round about you: (For ye have not walked in my laws, neither have ye kept mine ordinances)",
  "8": "Therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God) I will also come upon thee, for in the middest of thee will I sit in judgement, in the sight of the Heathen,",
  "9": "and will handle thee of such a fashion, as I never did before, and as I never will do from that time forth, and that because of all thine abominations.",
  "10": "For in the the fathers shall be fain to eat their own sons, and the sons their own fathers. Such a court will I keep in thee, and the whole remnant will I scatter in to all the winds.",
  "11": "Wherefore as truly as I live (sayeth the Lord GOD)(LORDE God) seeing thou hast defiled my Sanctuary, with all manner of abominations and with all thy shameful offenses: For this cause will I also destroy thee. Mine eye shall not oversee thee, neither will I spare thee.",
  "12": "One third part within thee, shall die of the pestilence and of hunger: Another third part shall be slain down round about thee, with the sword: The other third part that remaineth, will I scatter abroad toward all the winds, and draw out the sword after them.",
  "13": "Thus will I perform my indignation and set my wrath against them, and ease myself. So that when I have fulfilled mine anger against them, they shall know that I am the LORD, which with a fervent jealousy have spoken it.",
  "14": "Moreover I will make thee waste and abhorred, before all the Heathen that dwell about thee, and in the sight of all them, that go by thee:",
  "15": "so that when I punish thee in my wrath, in mine anger, and with the plague of my hot displeasure: thou shalt be a very abomination, shame, a gasing and wondering stock, among the Heathen, that lie about thee. Even I the LORD have spoken it, and it shall come to pass,",
  "16": "when I shoot among them the perilous darts of hunger, which shall be but death: Yea therefore shall I shoot them, because I will destroy you. I will increase hunger, and minish all the provision of bread among you.",
  "17": "Plagues and misery will I send you, yea and wild beasts also to destroy you. Pestilence and bloodsheding shall come upon you, and the sword will I bring over you. Even I, the LORD, have said it."
