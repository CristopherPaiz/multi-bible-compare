  "1": "The word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "Thou son of man: What cometh of the vine among all other trees? And of the vine stock among all other timber of the groove?",
  "3": "Do men take wood of it, to make any work withal? Or may there a nail be made of it, to hang anything upon?",
  "4": "Behold, it is cast into the fire to be brent, the fire consumeth both the ends of it, the middest is brent to ashes. Is it mete then for any work? No.",
  "5": "Seeing then, that it was mete for no work, being whole: much less may there anything be made of it, when the fire hath consumed and brent it.",
  "6": "And therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Like as I cast the vine into the fire for to be brent, as other trees of the wood: Even so will I do with them that dwell in Jerusalem,",
  "7": "and set my face against them: they shall go out from the fire, and yet the fire shall consume them. Then shall ye know, that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them,",
  "8": "and make the Land waste: because they have sore offended, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)"
