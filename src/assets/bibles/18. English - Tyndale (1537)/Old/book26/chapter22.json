  "4": "Thou hast made thy self guilty in the blood that thou hast shed, and defiled thee in the Idols, which thou hast made. Thou hast caused thy days to draw nigh, and made the time of thy years to come. Therefore will I make thee to be confounded among the heathen, and to be despised in all the lands,",
  "5": "whether they be nigh or far from thee: they shall laugh thee to scorn, thou that hast gotten thee so foul a name, and art full of mischief.",

  "7": "In thee have they despised father and mother, in thee have they oppressed the stranger, in thee have they vexed the widow and the fatherless.",
  "8": "Thou hast despised my Sanctuary, and unhallowed my Sabbath.",
  "9": "Murderers are there in thee, that shed blood, and eat upon the hills, and in thee they use unhappiness.",
  "10": "In thee have they discovered their fathers' shame, in thee have they vexed women in their sickness.",
  "11": "Every man hath dealt shamefully with his neighbour's wife, and abominably defiled his daughter-in-law. In thee hath every man forced his own sister, even his father's daughter.",
  "12": "Yea gifts have been received in thee, to shed blood. Thou hast taken usury and increase, thou hast oppressed thy neighbours by extortion, and forgotten me, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "13": "Behold, I have smitten my hands upon thy covetousness, that thou hast used, and upon the blood which hath been shed in thee.",

  "18": "Thou son of man, the house of Israel is turned to dross. All they that should be brass, tin, iron and lead, are in the fire become dross.",
  "19": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) for so much as ye all are turned into dross, behold: I will bring you together unto Jerusalem,",
  "20": "like as silver, and brass, iron, tin, and lead, are put together in the furnace and the fire blown there under to melt them: Even so will I gather you, put you in together, and melt you in my wrath and indignation.",
  "21": "I will bring you together, and kindle the fire of my cruel displeasure under you, that ye may be melted therein.",

  "27": "Thy rulers in thee are like ravishing wolves, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, for their own covetous lucre.",
  "28": "As for thy Prophets, they daub with untempered clay, they see vanities, and prophesy lies unto thee, saying: the Lord GOD(LORDE God) sayeth so, where as the LORD hath not spoken.",
  "29": "The people in the land useth wicked extortion and robbery. They vex the poor and needy and oppress the stranger against right.",
  "30": "And I sought in the land for a man, that would make up the hedge, and set himself in the gap before me in the lands behalf, that I should not utterly destroy it: but I could find none.",
  "31": "Therefore will I poured out my cruel displeasure upon them, and burn them in the fire of my wrath: their own ways will I recompense upon their heads, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)"
