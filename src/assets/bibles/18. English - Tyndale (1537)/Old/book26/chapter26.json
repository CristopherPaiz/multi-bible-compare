  "4": "These shall break the walls of Tyre, and cast down her towers: I will scrape the ground from her, and make her a bare stone:",

  "6": "her daughters upon the field shall perish with the sword, that they may know, how that I am the LORD.",
  "7": "For thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Behold, I will bring hither Nabuchodonosor (which is the king of Babylon and a king of kings) from the North upon Tyre, with horses, chariots, horsemen, and with a great multitude of people.",
  "8": "Thy daughters that are in the land, shall he slay with the sword: but against thee, he shall make bulwarks and grave up ditches about thee, and lift up his shield against thee.",
  "9": "His slings and battlerams shall he prepare for thy walls, and with his weapons break down thy towers.",

  "11": "With the hoofs of his horse's feet, shall he tread down all thy streets. He shall slay thy people with the sword, and break down the pillars of thy strength.",
  "12": "They shall waste away thy riches, and spoil thy merchandise. Thy walls shall they break down, and destroy thy houses of pleasure. Thy stones, thy timber and foundations shall they cast in the water.",
  "13": "Thus will I bring the melody of thy songs, and the voice of thy minstrelsy to an end, so that they shall no more be heard.",

  "16": "All kings of the sea shall come down from their seats regal: they shall lay away their robes, and put off their costly clothing: Yea with trembling shall they be clothed, they shall sit upon the ground: they shall be afraid at thy sudden fall, and be abashed at thee.",
  "17": "They shall mourn for thee, and say unto thee: O thou noble city, that hast been so greatly occupied of old, thou that hast been the strongest upon the sea with thine inhabiters of whom all men stood in fear: How art thou now so utterly destroyed?",

And I will make thee to be no more in honor, in the land of the living.",
  "21": "I will make an end of thee, and thou shalt be gone. Though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou not be found for evermore, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)"
