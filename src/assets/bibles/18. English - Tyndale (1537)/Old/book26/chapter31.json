  "1": "Moreover, it happened in the eleventh year, the first day of the third Month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "Thou son of man speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his people: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?",
  "3": "Behold, Assur was like a Cedar tree upon the mount of Libanus, with fair branches: so thick, that he gave shadows, and shot out very high. His top reached into the clouds.",
  "4": "The waters made him great, and the deep set him up on high.(an hye) Round about the roots of him ran there floods of water, he sent out his little rivers unto all the trees of the field.",
  "5": "Therefore was he higher than all the trees of the field, and thorow the multitude of waters that he sent from him, he obtained many and long branches.",
  "6": "All fowls of the air made their nests in his branches, under his boughs gendered all these beasts of the field and under his shadow dwelt all people.",
  "7": "Fair and beautiful was he in his greatness and in the length of his branches, for his root stood beside great waters,",
  "8": "no Cedar tree might hide him. In the pleasant garden of God, there was no fir tree like his branches, the plain trees were not like the boughs(bowes) of him. All the trees in the garden of God might not be compared unto him in his beauty:",
  "9": "So fair and goodly had I made him with the multitude of his branches: In so much, that all the trees in the pleasant garden of God, had envy at him.",
  "10": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) For so much as he hath lift up himself so high, and stretched his top into the clouds, and seeing his heart is proud in his highness:",
  "11": "I will deliver him into the hands of the mightiest among the Heathen, which shall root him out. According to his wickedness will I cast him away,",
  "12": "the enemies shall destroy him, and the mighty men of the Heathen shall so scatter him, that his branches shall lie upon all mountains and in all valleys: his boughs(bowes) shall be broken down to the ground thorowout the land. Then all the people of the land shall go from his shadow, and forsake him.",
  "13": "When he is fallen, all the fowls of the air shall sit upon him, and all wild beasts of the field shall go about among his branches:",
  "14": "so that from henceforth, no tree in the water shall attain to his highness, nor reach his top unto the clouds, neither shall any tree of the water stand so high, as he hath done. For unto death shall they all be delivered under the earth, and go down to the grave, like other men.",
  "15": "Moreover, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) In the day when he goeth down to the grave, I will cause a lamentation to be made, I will cover the deep upon him, I will staunch his floods, and the great waters shall be restrained. I shall cause Libanus to be sorrowful for his sake, and all the trees of the field shall be smitten.",
  "16": "I will make the Heathen shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell, with them that descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, with all the chosen and best trees of Libanus, yea and all they that are planted upon the waters, shall mourn with him also in the lower habitations:",
  "17": "for they shall go down to hell with him, unto them that be slain with the sword, which dwelt afore under the shadow of his arm among the Heathen.",
  "18": "To whom shalt thou be likened, that art so glorious and great, among the trees of Eden? Yet art thou cast down under the earth (among the trees of Eden) where thou must lie among the uncircumcised, with them that be slain with the sword. Even thus is it with Pharaoh and all his people, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)"
