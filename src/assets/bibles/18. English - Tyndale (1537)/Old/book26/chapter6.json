  "1": "And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",
  "2": "thou son of man, turn thy face to the mountains of Israel, that thou mayest prophesy(prophecie) unto them,",
  "3": "and say: Hear the word of the Lord GOD,(LORDE God) O ye mountains of Israel: Thus hath the Lord GOD(LORDE God) spoken to the mountains, hills, rivers, valleys and dales. Behold, I will bring a sword over you, and destroy your high places.",
  "4": "I will cast down your alters, and break down your temples. Your slain men will I lay before your gods.",
  "5": "And the dead carcasses of the children of Israel will I cast before their images, your bones will I destroy(strow) round about your altars,",
  "6": "and dwelling places. The cities shall be desolate, the hill chapels laid waste: your alters destroyed, and broken: your gods cast down, and taken away, your temples laid even with the ground, your own works clean rooted out.",
  "7": "Your slain men shall lie among you, that ye may learn to know, how that I am the LORD.",
  "8": "Those that among you have escaped the sword, will I leave among the Gentiles, for I will scatter you among the nations.",
  "9": "And they that escape from you, shall think upon me among the Heathen, where they shall be in captivity. As for that whorish and unfaithful heart of theirs, wherewith they run away from me, I will break it: yea and put out those eyes of theirs, that committed fornication with their Idols. Then shall they be ashamed, and displeased with their selves, for the wickedness and abominations, which they have done:",
  "10": "and shall learn to know, how that it is not in vain, that I the LORD spake, to bring such misery upon them.",
  "11": "The LORD said moreover unto me: Smite thy hands together, and stamp with thy feet, and say: Woe worth all the abominations and wickednesses of the house of Israel, for because of them, they shall perish with the sword, with hunger and with pestilence.",
  "12": "Who so is far off, shall die of the pestilence: he that is nigh at hand, shall perish with the sword: and the other that are besieged, shall die of hunger. Thus will I satisfy my wrothful displeasure upon them.",
  "13": "And so shall ye learn to know, that I am the LORD, when your slain men lie among your gods, and about your alters: upon all high hills and tops of mountains, among all green trees, among all thick oaks: even in the places, where they did sacrifice to all their Idols.",
  "14": "I will stretch mine hand out upon them, and will make the land waste: So that it shall lie desolate and void, from the wilderness of Deblathah forth, thorow all their habitations: to learn them for to know, that I am the LORD."
