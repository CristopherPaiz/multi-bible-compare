  "1": "It happened that in the sixth year, the fifth day of the sixth Month, I sat in my house, and the lords(LORDES) of the counsel of Judah with me: and the hand of the Lord GOD(LORDE God) fell even there upon me.",
  "2": "And as I looked up, I saw as it were a likeness of fire from his loins downward, and from his loins upward it shined marvelous clear.",
  "3": "This similitude stretched out an hand, and took me by the hairy locks of my head, and the spirit lift me up betwixt heaven and earth: And God brought me in a vision to Jerusalem, into the entry(court) of the inner(inward) port that lieth toward the north: there stood an image, with whom he that hath all things in his power, was very wroth.",
  "4": "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was in the same place: even as I had seen it afore in the field.",
  "5": "And he said unto me: Thou son of man, O lift up thine eyes, and look toward the north. Then lift I up mine eyes toward the north, and behold: beside the port northward, there was an alter made unto the image of provocation in the very entering in.",
  "6": "And he said furthermore unto me: Thou son of man, seest thou what these do? Seest thou the great abominations that the house of Israel commit in this place? which ought not to be done in my sanctuary: But turn thee about, and thou shalt see yet greater abominations.",
  "7": "And with that brought he me to the court gate: and when I looked, behold, there was an hole in the wall.",
  "8": "Then said he unto me: Thou son of man, dig thorow the wall. And when I digged thorow the wall, behold there was a door.",
  "9": "And he said unto me: Go thy way in, and look what wicked abominations they do there.",
  "10": "So I went in, and saw: and behold, there were all manner of images of worms and beasts, all Idols and abominations of the house of Israel painted everychone round about the wall.",
  "11": "There stood also before the images. Seventy lords of the counsel(councell) of the house of Israel: and in the middest of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Saphan: And every one of them had a censor in his hand, and out of the incense, there went a smoke, as it had been a cloud.",
  "12": "Then said he unto me: Thou son of man, hast thou seen what the Senators of the house of Israel do secretly, everyone in his chamber: For they say; Tush, the LORD seeth us not, the LORD regardeth not the world.",
  "13": "And he said unto me: Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see the great abominations that they do.",
  "14": "And with that he brought me to the door of the port of the LORD's house, toward the north. And behold, there sat women mourning for Thamus.",
  "15": "Then said he unto me: hast thou seen this, thou son of man? Turn ye about, and thou shalt see yet greater abominations.",
  "16": "And so he brought me into the inward court of the LORD's house: And behold at the port of the LORD's house, betwixt the fore entry and the altar, there were five and twenty men, that turned their backs on the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, and these worshiped the son.",
  "17": "And he said unto me: hast thou seen this thou son of man? Thinketh the house of Israel, that it is but a trifle, to do these abominations here? Should they fill the land full of wickedness, and undertake to provoke me unto anger: Yea and purposely to cast up their noses upon me?",
  "18": "Therefore will I also do something in my wrothfull displeasure, so that mine eye shall not oversee them, neither will I spare them. Yea and though they cry in mine ears with loud voice, yet will I not hear them."
