  "16": "This is the mourning that the daughters of the Heathen shall make: Yea and sorrow and lamentation shall they take up, upon Egypt, and all her people, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "17": "In the twelfth year, the fifteenth day of the Month, came the word of the LORD unto me, saying:",
  "18": "Thou son of man. Take up a lamentation upon the people of Egypt, and cast them down, yea and the mighty people of the Heathen also, even with them that dwell beneath: and with them that go down into the grave.",
  "19": "Down (how fair soever thou be) and lay thee with the uncircumcised.",

  "24": "There is Elam also with all his people, and their graves round about: which all being wounded and slain with the sword, are gone down uncircumcised under the earth, which nevertheless sometime brought fear into the land of the living: for the which they bear their shame, with the other that be gone down to the grave.",
  "25": "Their burial is given them and all their people, among them that be slain. Their graves are round about all them, which be uncircumcised, and with them that be slain thorow the sword: for seeing that in times past they made the land of the living afraid, they must now bear their own shame, with them that go down to the pit, and lie among them, that be slain.",
  "26": "There is Mesech also and Tubal, and their people, and their graves round about. These all are among the uncircumcised, and them that be slain with the sword, because afore time they made the land of the living afraid.",
  "27": "Should not they then lie also among the worthies, and uncircumcised Giants? which with their weapons are gone down to hell: whose swords are laid under their heads, whose wickedness is upon their bones: because that as worthies, they have brought fear in to the land of the living:",
  "28": "Yea among the uncircumcised shalt thou be destroyed, and sleep with them, that perish thorow the sword.",
