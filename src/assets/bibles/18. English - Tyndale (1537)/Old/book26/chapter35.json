  "1": "Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:",

  "4": "Thy cities will I break down, and thou shalt lie void: that thou mayest know, how that I am the LORD.",
  "5": "For so much as thou bearest an old enemy against the children of Israel, and with a cruel hand hast made them afraid, what time as they were troubled and punished for their sin:",
  "6": "Therefore, as truly as I live, sayeth the Lord GOD,(LORDE God) I will prepare thee unto blood, yea blood shall follow upon thee: seeing thou layest wait for blood, therefore shall blood persecute thee.",

  "13": "Thus with your mouths ye have made your boost against me, yea and multiplied your proud words against me, which I have heard altogether.",
  "14": "Where unto, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) when the whole world is in wealth, then will I make thee waste.",
  "15": "And like as thou (O mount Seir) wast glad, because the heritage of the house of Israel was destroyed: even so will I do unto thee also, that thou and whole Edom shall be destroyed, and know, that I am the LORD."
