  "1": "Moreover, the spirit of the LORD lift me up, and brought me unto the east port of the LORD's house. And behold, there were twenty five men under the door: among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pheltiah the son of Bananiah, the rulers of the people.",
  "2": "Then said the LORD unto me: Thou son of man: these men imagine mischief, and a wicked counsel take they in this city,",
  "3": "saying: Tush, there is no destruction at hand, let us build houses: this Jerusalem is the cauldron, and we be the flesh.",
  "4": "Therefore shalt thou prophesy unto them, yea prophesy shalt thou unto them, O son of man.",
  "5": "And with that fell the spirit of the LORD upon me, and said unto me: Speak, thus sayeth the LORD: On this manner have ye(yee) spoken (O ye house of Israel) and I know the imaginations of your hearts.",
  "6": "Many one have ye murdered in this city, and filled the streets full of the slain.",
  "7": "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) The slain men that ye have laid on the ground in this city, are the flesh, and this city is the cauldron: But I will bring you out of it:",
  "8": "ye have drawn out the sword, even so will I also bring a sword over you, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "9": "I will drive you out of this city and deliver you into your enemies hand, and will condemn you.",
  "10": "Ye shall be slain in all the coasts of Israel, I will be avenged of you: to learn you for to know, that I am the LORD.",
  "11": "This city shall not be your cauldron, neither shall ye be the flesh therein: but in the coasts of Israel will I punish you,",
  "12": "that ye may know, that I am the LORD, in whose commandments ye have not walked, nor kept his laws: but have done after the customs of the Heathen, that lie round about you.",
  "13": "Now when I preached, Pheltiah the son of Bananiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: O Lord GOD,(LORDE God) wilt thou then utterly destroy all the remnant in Israel?",
  "14": "And so the word of the LORD came to me on this manner:",
  "15": "thou son of man: thy brethren, thy kinsfolk, and the whole house of Juda, which dwell at Jerusalem, say: They be gone far from the LORD, but the land is given us in possession.",
  "16": "Therefore tell them thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) I will send you far off among the Gentiles, and scatter you among the nations, and I will hallow you but a little, in the lands where ye shall come.",
  "17": "Tell them also, thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) I will gather you again out of the nations, and bring you from the countries were ye be scattered, and will give you the land of Israel again:",
  "18": "And thither shall ye come. And as for all impediments, and all your abominations: I will take them away.",
  "19": "And I will give you one heart, and will plant a new spirit within your bowels. That stoney heart will I take out of your body, and give you a fleshly heart:",
  "20": "that ye may walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: that ye may be my people, and I your God.",
  "21": "But look whose hearts are disposed to follow their abominations and wicked livings: those men's deeds will I bring upon their own heads, sayeth the Lord GOD.(LORDE God)",
  "22": "After this did the Cherubins lift up their wings, and the wheels went with them, and the glory of the Lord(God) was upon them.",
  "23": "So the glory of the LORD went up from the middest of the city, and stood upon the mount of the city toward the east.",
  "24": "But the wind took me up, and in a vision (which came by the spirit of God) it brought me again into the Caldea among the prisoners. Then the vision that I had seen, vanished away from me.",
  "25": "So I spake unto the prisoners, all the words of the LORD, which he had shewed me."
