  "1": "There is yet a plague under the Sun, and it is a general thing among men:",
  "2": "When God giveth a man riches, goods and honour, so that he wanteth nothing of all that his heart can desire: and yet God giveth him not leave to enjoy the same, but another man spendeth them. This is a vain thing and a miserable plague.",
  "3": "If a man beget an hundredth children, and live many years, so that his days are many in number, and yet can not enjoy his good, neither be buried: as for him I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.",
  "4": "For he cometh to naught, and goeth his way into darkness, and his name is forgotten.",
  "5": "Moreover, he seeth not the Son, and knoweth of no rest neither here nor there:",
  "6": "Yea though he lived two thousand years, yet hath he no good life. Come not all to one place?",
  "7": "All the labour that man taketh, is for himself, and yet his desire is never filled after his mind.",
  "8": "For what hath the wise more than the fool? What helpeth it the poor, that he knoweth to walk before the living?",
  "9": "The sight of the eyes is better, then that the soul should so depart away. Howbeit this is also a vain thing and a disquietness of mind.",
  "10": "What is more excellent than man? Yet can he not in the law get the victory of him that is mightier than he:",
  "11": "A vain thing is it to cast out many words, but what hath a man else?",
  "12": "For who knoweth what is good for man living, in the days of his vain life, which is but a shadow? Or, who will tell a man, what shall happen after him under the Son?"
