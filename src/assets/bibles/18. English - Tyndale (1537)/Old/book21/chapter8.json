  "1": "where as no man hath wisdom and understanding, to give answer there unto. Wisdom maketh a man's face to shine, but malice putteth it out of favour.",
  "2": "Keep the king's commandment (I warn thee) and the oath that thou hast made unto God.",
  "3": "Be not hasty to go out of his sight, and see thou continue in no evil thing: for whatsoever it pleaseth him, that doeth he.",
  "4": "Like as when a king giveth a charge, his commandment is mighty: Even so whom may say unto him: What doest thou?",
  "5": "Whoso keepeth the commandment, shall feel no harm: but a wise man's heart discerneth time and manner:",
  "6": "For everything will have opportunity and judgment, and this the thing that maketh men full of carefulness and sorrow.",
  "7": "And why? A man knoweth not what is for to come, for who will tell him?",
  "8": "Neither is there any man that hath power over the spirit, to keep still the spirit, nor to have any power in the time of death: it is not he also that can make an end of the battle, neither may ungodliness deliver him that meddleth withall.",
  "9": "All these things have I considered, and applied my mind unto every work that is under the Son: how one man hath lordship upon another to his own harm.",
  "10": "For I have oft seen the ungodly brought to their graves, and fallen down from the high and glorious place: insomuch that they were forgotten in the city, where they were had in so high and great reputation. This is also a vain thing.",
  "11": "Because now that evil works are not hastily punished, the heart of man giveth himself over unto wickedness.",
  "12": "But though an evil person offend an hundredth times, and have a long life: yet am I sure, that it shall go well with them that fear God, because they have him before their eyes.",
  "13": "Again, as for the ungodly, it shall not be well with him, neither shall he prolong his days: but even as a shadow, so shall he be that feareth not God.",
  "14": "Yet is there a vanity upon earth: there be just men, unto whom it happeneth, as though they had the works of the ungodly: Again, there be ungodly, with whom it goeth as though they had the works of the righteous. This me think also a vain thing.",
  "15": "Therefore I commend gladness, because a man hath no better thing under the Son, than to eat and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall he have of his labour all the days of his life, which God giveth him under the Son.",
  "16": "When I applied my mind to learn wisdom, and to know the travail that is in the world (and that of such a fashion, that I suffered not my eyes to sleep neither day nor night)",
  "17": "I understood of all the works of God, that it is not possible for a man, to attain unto works that are done under the Son: and though he bestow his labour to seek them out, yet can he not reach unto them: yea though a wise man would undertake to know them, yet might he not find them."
