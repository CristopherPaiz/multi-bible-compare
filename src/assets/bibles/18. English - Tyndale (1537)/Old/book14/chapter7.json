  "1": "And when Salomon had made an end of praying, there came down fire from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices. And the glory of the LORD filled the house:",
  "2": "that the priests could not go into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had fulfilled the house of the LORD.",
  "3": "And all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, and stooped with their faces to the earth upon the pavement and bowed themselves and confessed unto the LORD, that he was good and that his mercy lasted ever.",
  "4": "And the king and all the people offered offerings before the LORD.",
  "5": "So that king Salomon offered twenty two thousand oxen, and an hundredth and twenty thousand sheep. And so the king and all the people hallowed the house of God.",
  "6": "And the priests waited on their offices, and the Levites with instruments of music of the LORD which king David made to confess unto the LORD that his mercy lasteth ever, when David gave praise thorow their hands. And the priests blew trumpets fast by them: and all Israel stood.",
  "7": "Moreover Salomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the LORD: for there he offered burntofferings and the fat of the peaceofferings, because the brazen altar which Salomon had made, was not able to receive the burntofferings and the meat offerings and the fat.",
  "8": "And Salomon kept a feast the same season of seven days, and all Israel with him, an exceeding great congregation, even from Hemath unto the river of Egypt.",
  "9": "And the eighth day they made a gathering. For they kept the hallowing of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.",
  "10": "And the twenty third day of the seventh month, he let the people depart unto their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed to David, to Salomon and to Israel his people.",
  "11": "And so Salomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house and all that came in his heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house, and that prosperously.",
  "12": "And the LORD appeared to Salomon by night and said to him: I have heard thy petition and have chosen this place for myself to be an house of sacrifice.",
  "13": "Moreover if I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people:",
  "14": "yet if my people that are named after my name, shall humble themselves and make intercession and seek my presence, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and be merciful to their sins, and will heal their land.",
  "15": "Thereto mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayers made in this place.",
  "16": "And finally I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name be there for ever, and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.",
  "17": "And if thou shalt walk before me as David thy father walked, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe mine ordinances and my laws:",
  "18": "then I will stablish the seat of thy kingdom, according to the covenant I made with David thy father, saying: thou shalt have ever one or other that shall rule in Israel.",
  "19": "But and if ye turn away and forsake mine ordinances and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods and bow yourselves to them:",
  "20": "then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them, and will cast this house which I have sanctified for my name out of my sight, and will make a proverb and a tale of it among all nations.",
  "21": "And this house that is so high, shall be a wonder to all that passeth thereby that they shall say: why hath the LORD dealt on this fashion with this land and with this house?",
  "22": "And it shall be answered then, because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and caught hold on other gods, and bowed to them and served them: even therefore brought he on them all this evil."
