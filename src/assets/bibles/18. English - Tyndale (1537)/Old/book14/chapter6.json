  "9": "Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house, but thy son which shall issue out of thy loins, he shall build an house for my name.",
  "10": "And the LORD hath made good his saying that he hath spoken. For I arose in the room of David my father, and sat on the seat of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.",

  "25": "Then hear thou from heaven and be merciful unto the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.",
  "26": "If heaven be shut up, that there be no rain, because they have sinned against thee: yet if they pray at this place and confess thy name and turn from their sins at thy scourging:",

  "32": "Thereto a stranger which is not of thy people Israel, if he come from a far land for thy great name's sake and thy mighty hand and stretched out arm, and therefore come and pray at this house:",
  "33": "thou shalt hear him from heaven thy dwelling place, and shalt do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for. That all the nations of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doeth thy people Israel: and that it may be known how that this house which I have built, is called after thy name.",
  "34": "When thy people shall go out to war, against their enemies the way that thou shalt send them. If they pray to thee, the way toward this city which thou hast chosen, and house which I have built for thy name:",
  "35": "then hear from heaven, their supplication and prayer, and help them in their right.",
  "36": "If they shall sin against thee (as there is no man, but that he shall sin) and thou be angry with them and deliver them to their enemies, and they lead them away captive unto a land(country) far or near,(nigh)",
