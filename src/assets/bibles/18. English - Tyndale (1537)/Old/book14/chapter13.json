  "1": "The eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abiah to reign over Juda,",
  "2": "and he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gabaah. And there was war between Abiah and Jeroboam.",
  "3": "And Abiah made a battle with an Host of fighting men of four hundredth thousand chosen men. And Jeroboam put in array to fight against him, with eight hundredth thousand picked men and strong.",
  "4": "And Abiah stood up upon Zemaraim an hill in mount Ephraim and said: hear me thou Jeroboam and all Israel.",
  "5": "Becometh it not you to know how the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom of Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons, with a salted covenant.",
  "6": "But Jeroboam the son of Nabat the servant of Salomon the son of David, rebelled against his(the) lord.",
  "7": "And there gathered to him lewd men and unthrifties, and prevailed against Rehoboam the son of Salomon: for Rehoboam was young and tender hearted and not strong enough for them.",
  "8": "And now ye think to prevail against the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because ye be a great multitude and have with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.",
  "9": "And have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests like the nations of other lands: even whosoever cometh and filleth his hand with an ox and seven rams, the same is made priest to them that are no Gods.",
  "10": "But with us is the LORD our God whom we have not forsaken, and the priests of the sons of Aaron ministering unto the LORD, and the Levites in office,",
  "11": "burning unto the LORD every morning and every evening burntofferings and sweet cense: and the shewbread put in order upon a pure table: and the candlestick of gold with the lamps of the same, to be lighted every evening. For we keep the watch of the LORD our God: but ye have forsaken him.",
  "12": "Moreover see, God is with us in the foreward, and his priests, and the roaring trumpets to cry alarum against you. Ye children of Israel fight not with the LORD God of your fathers: for it will not prosper with you.",
  "13": "But for all that Jeroboam sent men privily above to come behind upon them: and so they were before Juda, and the layers in wait were behind them.",
  "14": "And when Juda turned and saw the battle behind and before, they cried unto the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets",
  "15": "and the men of Juda gave a shout. And as the men of Juda shouted, God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abiah and Juda.",
  "16": "And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord(God) delivered them into the hands of Juda.",
  "17": "And Abiah and his people slew a great slaughter of them: so that there were stricken down dead of Israel five hundredth thousand chosen men.",
  "18": "And so the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Juda prevailed: because they leaned unto the LORD God of their fathers.",
  "19": "And Abiah followed after Jeroboam and won certain cities from him: Bethel with the towns belonging thereto, and Jesanah with the towns that longed thereto, and Ephron with her towns.",
  "20": "And Jeroboam recovered not strength again in the days of Abiah. And at the last the LORD plagued him, that he died.",
  "21": "And Abiah waxed mighty, and took him fourteen wives, and begat twenty two sons and sixteen daughters.",
  "22": "The rest of the acts of Abiah and his ways and his doings are written in the story of the Prophet Ado."
