  "11": "And when the time came that the chest should be brought in by the hands of the Levites at the appointment of the king, when they saw that there was much money: then came the king's scribe and one appointed by the high priest, and poured out that was in the coffer, and then took it and carried it to his place again, and thus they did day by day, and gathered much money.",

  "16": "And they buried him in the city of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel, and on God and on his house.",
  "17": "And after the death of Jehoiada, came the lords of Juda and made obeisance to the king. And then he hearkened unto them.",
  "18": "And so they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and Images. And then came there wrath upon Juda and Jerusalem, for this their trespasses' sake.",
  "19": "Notwithstanding yet God sent Prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD. And they testified unto them. But they would not hear.",

  "25": "And as soon as they were departed from him, though they left him in great diseases: yet his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the children of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed. And when he was dead, they buried him in the city of David: but not in the sepulchers of the kings.",
