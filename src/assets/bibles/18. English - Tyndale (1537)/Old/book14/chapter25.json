  "1": "Amaziah was twenty five year old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty nine year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoiadan of Jerusalem.",
  "2": "And he did that pleased the LORD: but not with the whole heart.",
  "3": "And as soon as he was settled in the kingdom, he slew them that killed the king his father.",
  "4": "But he slew not their children as it is written in the law, even in the book of Moses to whom the LORD commanded saying: the fathers shall not die for the children's causes, nor the children for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.",
  "5": "And Amaziah gathered Juda together and made captains over thousands and over hundreds in the houses of their fathers thorowout all Juda and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty year and above, and found them three hundredth thousand lusty men able to go to battle, and that could handle spear and shield.",
  "6": "And he hired thereto an hundredth thousand fighting men out of Israel, for an hundredth talents of silver.",
  "7": "But there came a man of God to him and said: king, let not the army of Israel go with thee: for the LORD is not with Israel neither with any of the house of Ephraim.",
  "8": "Or else if thou needs wilt, then go and do it, and make thyself strong to battle: and thou shalt see, that God shall make thee fall before thine enemies. For God hath power to help or to cast down.",
  "9": "And Amaziah said again to the man of God, what shall we do then, for the hundredth talents which I have given unto the host of Israel? And the man of God said: the LORD is able to give thee much more than that.",
  "10": "And then Amaziah severed that army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Wherefore they were exceeding wroth with Juda, and returned to their own home in great anger.",
  "11": "And Amaziah took heart and carried out his host and went to Saltdale. Where he slew of the children of Seir ten thousand.",
  "12": "And other ten thousand the children of Juda took alive, and carried them unto the top of a rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all to burst:",
  "13": "but the men of the army which Amaziah had turned back and would not let go with his people to battle, ran upon the cities of Juda from Samaria unto Bethhoron and slew three thousand of them and won much spoil.",
  "14": "And it chanced, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, and had brought the gods of the children of Seir, he set them up to be his gods, and bowed himself before them and burned cense unto them.",
  "15": "Wherefore the LORD was wroth with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, and said to him: why seekest thou the gods of the people which were not able to deliver their own people out of thine hands?",
  "16": "And as the prophet spake to him, he said to the prophet: have men made thee of the king's counsel? cease, lest thou be beaten. And the prophet ceased and said: I am sure that God hath taken counsel to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and obeyest not my counsel.",
  "17": "Then Amaziah king of Juda took advice and sent to Joas the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel and said: come, and let us see each other.",
  "18": "And Joas king of Israel sent again to Amaziah king of Juda saying: a thistle in Libanon sent to a Cedar tree of Libanon saying: give thy daughter to my son to wife. But there came the wild beasts of Libanon and trod down the thistle.",
  "19": "Thou thinkest: see, I have beaten the Edomites, therefore thine heart ariseth to glorify thyself. Now bide at home: what needeth thee to provoke to evil, that thou perish and Juda with thee.",
  "20": "But Amaziah rested not: for it came of God, even to deliver them into the hands of their enemies: and that because they had sought the gods of the Edomites.",
  "21": "And Joas king of Israel came up: and they saw either other, both he and Amaziah king of Juda at Bethsames in Juda.",
  "22": "And Juda was put to the worse before Israel, and fled every man to his tent.",
  "23": "And Joas king of Israel took Amaziah king of Juda the son of Jehoas the son of Ohoziah at Bethsames: and brought him to Jerusalem, and tare the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundredth cubits long.",
  "24": "And he took all the gold and silver and all the Jewels that were found in the house of God with Obed Edom and the treasure of the king's house and hostages, and returned to Samaria.",
  "25": "And Amaziah the son of Jehoas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen year.",
  "26": "The rest of the acts of Amaziah first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.",
  "27": "And after that time that Amaziah did turn away from the LORD, they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachis. Whither they sent after him and slew him there,",
  "28": "and brought him up with horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Juda."
