  "1": "And the LORD said unto Moses: depart and go hence: both thou and the people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: unto thy seed I will give it.",
  "2": "And I will send an angel before thee, and will cast out the Cananites, the Amorites, the Hethites, the Pherezites, the Hevites, and the Jebusites:",
  "3": "that thou mayst go in to a land that floweth with milk and honey. But I will not go among you myself, for ye are a stiffnecked people: lest I consume you by the way.",
  "4": "And when the people heard this evil tidings, they sorrowed: and no man did put on his best raiment.",
  "5": "And the LORD spake unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: ye are a stiffnecked people: I must come once suddenly upon you, and make an end of you. But now put your goodly raiment from you, that I may wete what to do unto you.",
  "6": "And the children of Israel laid their goodly raiment from them even under the mount Horeb.",
  "7": "And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the host, afar off from the host, and called it the tabernacle of witness. And all that would ask any question of the LORD, went out unto the tabernacle of witness which was without the host.",
  "8": "And when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, all the people rose up and stood every man in his tent door and looked after Moses, until he was gone in to the tabernacle.",
  "9": "And as soon as Moses was entered into the tabernacle, the clouden pillar descended and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and he talked with Moses.",
  "10": "And when all the people saw the clouden pillar stand in the tabernacle door, they rose up and worshipped: every man in his tent door.",
  "11": "And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And when Moses turned again in to the host, the lad Josua his servant the son of Nun departed not out of the tabernacle.",
  "12": "And Moses said unto the LORD: see, thou saidest unto me: lead this people forth, but thou shewest me not whom thou wilt send with me. And hast said moreover: I know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight:",
  "13": "Now therefore, if I have found favour in thy sight, then shew me thy way and let me know thee: that I may find grace in thy sight. And look on this also, how that this nation is thy people.",
  "14": "And he said: my presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.",
  "15": "And he said: If thy presence go not with me, carry us not hence,",
  "16": "for how shall it be known now that both I and thy people have found favour in thy sight, but in that thou goest with us: that both I and thy people have a preeminence before all the people that are upon the face of the earth.",
  "17": "And the LORD said unto Moses: I will do this also that thou hast said, for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.",
  "18": "And he said: I beseech thee, shew me thy glory:",
  "19": "And he said: I will make all my good go before thee, and I will be called in this name Jehovah(Iehouah) before thee, and will shew mercy to whom I shew mercy, and will have compassion on whom I have compassion.",
  "20": "And he said furthermore: thou mayst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live.",
  "21": "And the LORD said: behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock,",
  "22": "and while my glory goeth forth I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will put mine hand upon thee while I pass by.",
  "23": "And then I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen."
