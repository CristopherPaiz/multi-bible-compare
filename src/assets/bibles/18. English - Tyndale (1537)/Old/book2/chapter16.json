  "1": "And they took their journey from Elim, and all the whole company of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which lieth between Elim and Sinai: the fifteenth day of the second month after that they were come out of the land of Egypt.",
  "2": "And the hole multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,",
  "3": "and said unto them: would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and ate bread our bellies' full for ye have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this hole multitude for hunger.",
  "4": "Then said the LORD unto Moses: behold, I will rain bread from heaven down to you, and let the people go out, and gather day by day, that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no.",
  "5": "The sixth day let them prepare that which they will bring in, and let it be twice as much as they gather in daily.",
  "6": "And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel: at even ye shall know that it is the LORD, which brought you out of the land of Egypt,",
  "7": "and in the morning ye shall see the glory of the LORD: because he hath heard your grudgings against the LORD: for what are we that ye should murmur against us?",
  "8": "And moreover spake Moses: At evening the LORD will give you flesh to eat, and in the morning bread enough, because the LORD hath heard your murmur which ye murmur against him: for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but against the LORD.",
  "9": "And Moses spake unto Aaron: Say unto all the company of the children of Israel, come forth before the LORD, for he hath heard your grudgings.",
  "10": "And as Aaron spake unto the hole multitude of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness: and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in a cloud.",
  "11": "And the LORD spake unto Moses saying:",
  "12": "I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel, tell them therefore and say that at evening they shall eat flesh, and in the morning they shall be filled with bread, and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.",
  "13": "And at evening the quails came and covered the ground where they lay. And in the morning the dew lay round about the host.",
  "14": "And when the dew was fallen: behold, it lay upon the ground in the wilderness, small and round and thin as the hoar frost on the ground.",
  "15": "When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: what is this? for they wist not what it was; And Moses said: this is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.",
  "16": "This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, that ye gather every man enough for him to eat: a gomer full for a man according to the number of you, and gather every man for them which are in his tent.",
  "17": "And the children of Israel did even so, and gathered some more some less,",
  "18": "and did mete it with a gomer. And unto him that had gathered much remained nothing over, and unto him that had gathered little was there no lack: but every man had gathered sufficient for his eating.",
  "19": "And Moses said unto them: See that no man let ought remain of it till the morning.",
  "20": "Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses: but some of the left of it until the mornynge, and it waxed full of worms and stank, and Moses was angry with them.",
  "21": "And they gathered it all mornings: every man as much as sufficed for his eating, for as soon as the heat of the son(sonne) came it melted.",
  "22": "And the sixth day they gathered twice so much bread, two gomers for one man, and the rulers of the multitude came and told Moses.",
  "23": "And he said unto them: this is that which the LORD hath said: tomorrow is the Sabbath of the holy rest of the LORD: bake that which ye will bake and fetch that ye will fetch, and that which remaineth lay up for you, and keep it till the morning.",
  "24": "And they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade, and it stank not, neither was there any worms therein.",
  "25": "And Moses said: that eat this day: for today it is the LORD's Sabbath: today ye shall find none in the field.",
  "26": "Sixth days ye shall gather it, for the seventh is the Sabbath: there shall be none therein.",
  "27": "Notwithstanding there went out of the people in the seventh day for to gather: but they found none.",
  "28": "Then the LORD said unto Moses: how long shall it be, yer ye will keep my commandments and laws?",
  "29": "See because the LORD hath given you a Sabbath, therefore he giveth you the sixth day bread for two days. Bide therefore every man at home, and let no man go out of his place the seventh day.",
  "30": "And the people rested the seventh day.",
  "31": "And the house of Israel called it Man. And it was like unto Coriander seed and white, and the taste of it was like unto wafers made with honey.",
  "32": "And Moses said: this is that which the LORD commandeth: fill a gomer of it, that it may be kept for your children after you: that they may see the bread wherewith he fed you in wilderness, when he had brought you out of the land of Egypt.",
  "33": "And Moses spake unto Aaron: take a cruse and put a gomer full of Man therein, and lay it up before the LORD to be kept for your children after you,",
  "34": "as the LORD commanded Moses. And Aaron laid it up before the testimony there to be kept.",
  "35": "And the children of Israel ate man forty year until they came unto a land inhabited. And so they ate Man, even until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan,",
  "36": "and a gomer is the tenth part of an Epha."
