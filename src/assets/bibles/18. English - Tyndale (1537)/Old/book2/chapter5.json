  "3": "I know not the LORD, neither will let Israel go. And they said: the God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go (we pray thee) three days' journey into the desert, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God: lest he smite us either with pestilence or with sword.",
  "4": "Then said the king of Egypt unto them: wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their work, get you unto your labour.",
  "5": "And Pharao said furthermore: behold, there is much people in the land, and ye make them play and let their work stand.",

  "17": "And he answered: idle are ye idle, and therefore ye say: let us go and do sacrifice unto the LORD.",
  "18": "Go therefore and work, for there shall no straw be given you, and yet see that ye deliver the hole tale of brick.",
  "19": "When the officers of the children of Israel saw themself in shrewd case (in that he said ye shall minish nothing of your daily making of brick)",
  "20": "then they met Moses and Aaron standing in their way as they came out from Pharao,",
  "21": "and said unto them: The LORD look unto you and judge, for ye have made the savour of us stink in the sight of Pharao and of his servants, and have put a sword into their hands to slay us.",

  "23": "For since I came to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath fared foul with this folk, and yet thou hast not delivered thy people at all;"
