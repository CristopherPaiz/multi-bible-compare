  "21": "If thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send all manner flies both upon thee and thy servants, and thy people, and into thy houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of flies, and the ground whereon they are.",
  "22": "But I will separate the same day the land of Gosan where my people are, so that there shall no flies be there: that thou mayest know that I am the LORD upon the earth.",
  "23": "And I will put a division between my people and thine. And even tomorrow shall this miracle be done.",

  "25": "Then Pharao sent for Moses and Aaron and said: Go and do sacrifice unto your God in the land.",
  "26": "And Moses answered: it is not mete so to do. For we must offer unto the LORD our God, that which is an abomination unto the Egyptians: behold shall we sacrifice that which is an abomination unto the Egyptians before their eyes, and shall they not stone us?",

  "30": "And Moses went out from Pharao and prayed unto the LORD.",
  "31": "And the LORD did as Moses had said, and took away the flies from Pharao and from his servants and from his people, so that there remained not one.",
