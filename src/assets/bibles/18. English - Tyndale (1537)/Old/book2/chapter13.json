  "1": "And the LORD spake unto Moses saying:",
  "2": "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn that open all manner matrices among the children of Israel, as well of men as of beasts: for they are mine.",
  "3": "And Moses said unto the people: think on this day in which ye came out of Egypt and out of the house of bondage: for with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out from thence. See therefore that ye eat no leavened bread.",
  "4": "This day come ye out of Egypt in the month of Abib.",
  "5": "When the LORD hath brought thee in to the land of the Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Hevites and Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers that he would give thee: a land wherein milk and honey floweth, then see that thou keep this service in this same month.",
  "6": "Seven days thou shalt eat sweet bread, and the seventh day shall be feastful unto the LORD.",
  "7": "Therefore thou shalt eat sweet bread seven days, and see that there be no leavened bread seen nor yet leaven among you in all your quarters.",
  "8": "And thou shalt shew thy son at that time saying: this is done, because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came out of Egypt.",
  "9": "Therefore it shall be a sign unto thee upon thine hand and a remembrance between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD brought thee out of Egypt,",
  "10": "see thou keep therefore this ordinance in his season from year to year.",
  "11": "Moreover when the LORD hath brought thee into the land of the Cananites, as he hath sworn unto thee and to thy fathers, and hath given it thee,",
  "12": "then thou shalt appoint unto the LORD all that openeth the matrice, and all the firstborn among the beasts which thou hast if they be males.",
  "13": "And all the firstborn of the asses, thou shalt redeem with a sheep: if thou redeem him not, then break his neck. But all the firstborn among thy children shalt thou buy out.",
  "14": "And when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying: what is this? thou shalt say unto him: with a mighty hand and LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.",
  "15": "And when Pharao was loth to let us go, the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: as well the firstborn of men as of beasts. And therefore I sacrifice unto the LORD all the males that open the matrice, but all the firstborn of my children I must redeem.",
  "16": "And this shall be as a token in thine hand, and as a thing hanged up between thine eyes: because the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.",
  "17": "When Pharao had let the people go, God carried them not thorow the land of the Philistines, though it were a nigh way. For God said: the people might haply repent when they see war, and so turn again to Egypt:",
  "18": "therefore God led thee about thorow the wilderness that bordereth on the red sea. The children of Israel went harnessed out of the land of Egypt.",
  "19": "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he made the children of Israel swear saying: God will surely visit you, take my bones therefore away hence with you.",
  "20": "And they took their journey from Sucoth: and pitched their tents in Etham in the edge of the wilderness.",
  "21": "And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way: and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light: that they might go both by day and night.",
  "22": "And the pillar of the cloud never departed by day nor the pillar of fire by night out of the people's sight."
