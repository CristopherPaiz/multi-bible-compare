  "36": "When the cloud was taken up from off the habitation, the children of Israel took their journeys as oft as they journeyed.",
  "37": "And if the cloud departed not, they journeyed not till it departed:",
  "38": "for the cloud of the LORD was upon the habitation by day, and fire by night: in the sight of all the house of Israel in all their journeys. [The end of the second book of Moses.]"
