  "1": "Of David The LORD is my light and my health: whom then should I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life, for whom then should I be afraid?",
  "2": "Therefore when the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me, to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.",
  "3": "Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid: and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.",
  "4": "One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require: namely, that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.",
  "5": "For in the time of trouble he hath hid me in his tabernacle, yea in the secret place of his dwelling hath he kept and set me up upon a rock of stone.",
  "6": "And now hath he lift up my head above mine enemies, that compassed me round about. Therefore will I offer in his dwelling, the oblation of thanksgiving: I will (both) sing and speak praises unto the LORD.",
