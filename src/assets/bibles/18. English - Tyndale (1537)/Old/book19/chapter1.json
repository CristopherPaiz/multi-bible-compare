  "1": "O Blessed is the man that goeth not in the counsel of the ungodly: that abideth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of the scornful.",
  "2": "But delighteth in the law of the LORD, and exerciseth himself in his law, both day and night.",
  "3": "Such a man is like a tree planted by the water side, that bringeth forth his fruit in due season. His leaves shall not fall off, and look whatsoever he doth, it shall prosper.",
  "4": "As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the dust, which the wind scattereth away from the ground.",
  "5": "Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment, neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.",
  "6": "For the LORD alloweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
