  "3": "For they gat not the land in possession thorow their own sword, neither was it their own arm that helped them. But thy right hand, thine arm and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.",

  "16": "For the voice of the slanderer(sclaunderer) and blasphemer, for the enemy and avenger.",

  "23": "Up Lord,(LORDE) why sleepest thou; Awake, and cast us not off for ever.",
  "24": "Wherefore hidest thou thy face? wilt thou clean forget our misery and oppression?",
  "25": "For our soul is brought low even unto the dust, and our belly cleaveth unto the ground.",
  "26": "Arise O Lord,(LORDE) help us, and deliver us for thy mercy sake."
