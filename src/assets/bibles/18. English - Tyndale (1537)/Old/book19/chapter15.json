  "2": "Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: that doth the thing which is right, and that speaketh the truth from his heart.",
  "3": "He that useth no deceit in his tongue: he that doth no evil to his neighbour, and slandereth(sclaundereth) not his neighbours.",
  "4": "He that sitteth not by the ungodly, but maketh much of them that fear the LORD: he that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth(dispointeth) him not.",
  "5": "He that giveth not his money upon usury, and taketh no reward against the innocent. Who so doth these things, shall never be removed."
