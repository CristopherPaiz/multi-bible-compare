  "1": "To the chanter, a Psalm of David The foolish bodies say in their hearts: Tush, there is no God. They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings, there is not one that doth good.",
  "2": "The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that would understand and seek after God.",
  "3": "But they are all gone out of the way, they are all together become unprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one.",
  "4": "How can they have understanding, that work mischief, eating up my people, as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?",
  "5": "Therefore shall they be brought in great fear, for God standeth by the generation of the righteous.",
  "6": "As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor, because he putteth his trust in the LORD.",
  "7": "Oh that the saving health were given unto Israel out of Sion. Oh that the LORD would deliver his people out of captivity. Then should Jacob rejoice, and Israel should be right glad."
