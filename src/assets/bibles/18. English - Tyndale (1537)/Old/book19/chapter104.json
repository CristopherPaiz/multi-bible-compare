  "1": "Praise the LORD O my soul: O LORD my God, thou art become exceedingly glorious, thou art clothed with majesty and honour.",
  "2": "Thou deckest thyself with light, as it were with a garment, thou spreadest out the heaven like a curtain.",
  "3": "Thou boltest it above with waters, thou makest the clouds thy chariot, and goest upon the wings of the wind.",
  "4": "Thou makest thine angels spirits, and thy ministers flames of fire.",
  "5": "Thou hast laid the earth upon her foundation, that it never moveth at any time.",
  "6": "Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment, so that the waters stand above the hills.",
  "7": "But at thy rebuke they flee, at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.",
  "8": "(Then are the hills seen aloft, and the valleys beneath in their place which thou hast appointed for them)",
  "9": "Thou hast set them their bounds, which they may not pass, that they turn not again to cover the earth.",
  "10": "Thou causest the wells to spring up among the valleys, and the waters to run among the hills.",
  "11": "That all the beasts of the field may have drink, and that the wild asses may quench their thirst.",
  "12": "Above upon the hills have the fowls of the air their habitation, and sing among the branches.",
  "13": "Thou waterest the hills from above, the earth is filled with the fruits of thy works.",
  "14": "Thou bringest forth grass for the cattle, and green herbs for the service of men.",
  "15": "Thou bringest food out of the earth: wine to make glad the heart of man, oil to make him a cheerful countenance and bread to strengthen man's heart.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD are full of sap, even the trees of Lebanus which he hath planted.",
  "17": "There make the birds their nests, and the fir hills(trees) are a dwelling for the stork.",
  "18": "The hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and so are the stony rocks for the conies.",
  "19": "Thou hast appointed the Moon for certain seasons, the sun(Sonne) knoweth his going down.",
  "20": "Thou makest darkness, that it may be night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do move.",
  "21": "Yea the young lions which roar after their prey, and seek their meat at God.",
  "22": "But when the sun(Sonne) ariseth, they get them away together, and lie them down in their dens.",
  "23": "Then goeth forth man to his work, and to till his land until the evening.",
  "24": "O LORD, how manifold are thy works, right wisely hast thou made them all: yea the earth is full of thy riches.",
  "25": "So is this great and wide sea also, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.",
  "26": "There go the ships over, and there is that Leviathan, whom thou hast made, to take his pastime therein.",
  "27": "They wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them meat in due season.",
  "28": "When thou givest it them, they gather it: when thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.",
  "29": "But when thou hidest thy face, they are sorrowful: if thou takest away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.",
  "30": "Again, when thou lettest thy breath go forth, they are made, and so thou renewest the face of the earth.",
  "31": "The glorious majesty of the LORD endureth for ever, and the LORD rejoiceth in his works.",
  "32": "The earth trembleth at the look of him, he doth but touch the hills and they smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live, I will praise my God while I have my being.",
  "34": "O that my words might please him, for my joy is in the LORD.",
  "35": "As for the sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall come to an end: but praise thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise the everlasting.(Halleluya)"
