  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the Heathen are fallen into thine heritage: the holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.",
  "2": "The dead bodies of thy servants have they given unto the fowls of the air to be devoured, and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.",
  "3": "Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, and there was no man to bury them.",
  "4": "We are become an open shame unto our enemies, a very scorn and derision unto them that are round about us.",
  "5": "LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?",
  "6": "Pour out thy indignation upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.",
  "7": "For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.",
  "8": "O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon, for we are come to great misery.",
  "9": "Help us, O God our saviour, for the glory of thy name: O deliver us, and forgive us our sins for thy name's sake.",
  "10": "Wherefore shall the Heathen say: Where is now their God? O let the vengeance of thy servant's blood that is shed, be openly shewed upon the Heathen in our sight.",
  "11": "O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee, and according unto the power of thy arm, preserve those that are appointed to die.",
  "12": "And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee, reward them, O Lord,(LORDE) seven fold into their bosom.",
  "13": "So we that be the people and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks forever, and will alway be shewing forth thy praise more and more."
