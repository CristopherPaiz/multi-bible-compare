  "3": "There is neither speech nor language, but their voices are heard among them.",
  "4": "Their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words in to the ends of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sun,(Sone)",
  "5": "which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.",
  "6": "It goeth forth from the one end of the heaven, and runneth about unto the same end again, and there may no man hide himself from the heat thereof.",
