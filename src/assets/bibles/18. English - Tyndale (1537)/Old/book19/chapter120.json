  "1": "The song of the stairs When I am in trouble, I call upon the LORD, and he answereth me.",
  "2": "Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.",
  "3": "What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue?",
  "4": "Even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.",
  "5": "Who is me that my banishment endureth so long: I dwell in the tabernacles of the sorrowful.",
  "6": "My soul hath long dwelt among them, that be enemies unto peace.",
  "7": "I laboured for peace, but when I spake thereof, they made them to battle."
