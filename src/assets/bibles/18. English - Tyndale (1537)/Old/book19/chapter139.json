  "1": "To the chanter, a Psalm of David. O LORD, thou searchest me out, and knowest me.",
  "2": "Thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thoughts afar off.",
  "3": "Thou art about my path and about my bed, and spiest out all my ways.",
  "4": "For lo, there is not a word in(i) my tongue, but thou, O LORD, knowest it altogether.",
  "5": "Thou hast fashioned me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.",
  "6": "Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me, I can not attain unto it.",
  "7": "Whither shall I go then from thy spirit? or, whither shall I go then(flee) from thy presence?",
  "8": "If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.",
  "9": "If I take the wings of the morning, and remain in the uttermost(utmost) part of the sea:",
  "10": "Even there also shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.",
  "11": "If I say: peradventure the darkness shall cover me, then shall my night be turned to day.",
  "12": "Yea the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day, the darkness and light are both alike.",
  "13": "For my reins are thine, thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.",
  "14": "I will give thanks unto thee, for I am wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.",
  "15": "My bones are not hid from thee, though I be made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the earth.",
  "16": "Thine eyes see mine unperfectness, they stand all written in thy book: my days were fashioned, when as yet there was not one of them.",
  "17": "How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God? O how great is the sum of them.",
  "18": "If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up, I am present with thee.",
  "19": "Wilt thou not slay the wicked (oh God) that the bloodthirsty might depart from me?",
  "20": "For they speak unright of thee, thine enemies exalt themselves presumptuously.",
  "21": "I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee: and I may not away with those that rise up against thee?",
  "22": "Yea I hate them right sore, therefore are they mine enemies.",
  "23": "Try me, O God, and seek the ground of mine heart: prove me, and examine my thoughts.",
  "24": "Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
