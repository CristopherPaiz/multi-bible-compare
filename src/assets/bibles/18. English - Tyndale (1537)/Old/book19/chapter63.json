  "1": "A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Juda. O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee, my soul thursteth for thee, my flesh longeth after thee in a barren and dry land, where no water is.",
  "2": "Thus do I look for thee in thy Sanctuary, that I might behold thy power and glory.",
  "3": "For thy loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.",
  "4": "As long as I live will I magnify thee and lift up my hands in thy name.",
  "5": "My soul is satisfied even as it were with marry and fatness, when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.",
  "6": "In my bed will I remember thee, and when I wake my talking shall be of thee.",
  "7": "For thou hast been my helper, and under the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.",
  "8": "My soul hangeth upon thee, thy right hand upholdeth me.",
  "9": "They seek after my soul, but in vain, for they shall go under the earth.",
  "10": "They shall fall into the sword, and be a portion for foxes.",
  "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God: all they that swear by him, shall be commended, for the mouth of liars shall be stopped."
