  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. O How loving is God unto Israel, to such as are of a clean heart?",
  "2": "Nevertheless my feet were almost gone, my treadings had well nigh slipped.",
  "3": "And why? I was grieved at the wicked, to see the ungodly in such prosperity.",
  "4": "For they are in no peril of death, but stand fast like a palace.",
  "5": "They come in no misfortune like other folk, neither are they plagued like other men.",
  "6": "And this is the cause that they be so puffed(puft) up in pride, and overwhelmed with cruelty and unrighteousness.",
  "7": "Their eyes swell for fatness, they do even what they list.",
  "8": "Corrupt are they, and speak blasphemies maliciously, proud and presumptuous are their words.",
  "9": "They stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, and their tongue goeth thorow the world.",
  "10": "Therefore fall the people unto them, and there out suck they no small advantage.",
  "11": "Tush (say they) How should God perceive it? is there knowledge in the most highest?",
  "12": "Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, these have riches in possession.",
  "13": "Should I then cleanse my heart in vain, (thought I) and wash my hands in innocency?",
  "14": "Wherefore should I be then punished daily, and be chastened every morning?",
  "15": "Yea I had almost also said even as they do: but lo, then should I have condemned the generation of thy children.",
  "16": "Then thought I to understand this, but it was too hard for me.",
  "17": "Until I went into the Sanctuary of God, and considered the end of these men.",
  "18": "Namely how thou hast set them in a slippery place, that thou mayest cast them down headlong(headlynges) and destroy them.",
  "19": "O how suddenly do they consume, perish and come to a fearful end.",
  "20": "Yea even like as a dream when one awaketh, so makest thou their image to vanish out of the city.",
  "21": "Thus my heart was grieved, and it went even thorow my reins.",
  "22": "So foolish was I and ignorant, and as it were a beast before thee.",
  "23": "Nevertheless I am alway by thee, thou holdest me by my right hand.",
  "24": "Thou leadest me with thy counsel, and afterward receivest me unto glory.",
  "25": "O what is there prepared for me in heaven? there is no thing upon earth, that I desire in comparison of thee.",
  "26": "My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.",
  "27": "For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou destroyest all them that commit fornication against thee.",
  "28": "But it is good for me, to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord GOD,(LORDE God) and to speak of all thy works."
