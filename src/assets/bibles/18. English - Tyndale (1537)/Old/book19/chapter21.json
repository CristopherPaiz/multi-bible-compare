  "1": "To the Chanter, a Psalm of David LORD,(Lorde) how joyful is the king in thy strength? O how exceedingly glad is he of thy saving health?",
  "2": "Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not put him from the request of his lips. Selah.",
  "3": "For thou hast prevented him with liberal blessings, and set a crown of gold on his head.",
  "4": "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life, even for ever and ever.",
  "5": "His honour is great in thy saving health, glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon him.",
  "6": "For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, and make him glad with the joy of thy countenance.",
  "7": "And why? because the king putteth his trust in the LORD, and in the mercy of the most highest(hiest) he shall not miscarry.",
  "8": "Let all thine enemies feel thy hand: let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.",
  "9": "Thou shalt make them like a fire oven in the time of thy wrath: the LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.",
  "10": "Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.",
  "11": "For they intended mischief against thee, and imagined such devices, as they were not able to perform.",
  "12": "Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, and with thy strings thou shalt make ready thine arrows against the faces of them.",
  "13": "Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength, so will we sing and praise thy power."
