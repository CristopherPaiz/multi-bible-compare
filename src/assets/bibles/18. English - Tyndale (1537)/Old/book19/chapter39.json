  "1": "To the Chanter for Iduthun,(praising) a Psalm of David. I said: I will keep my ways that I offended not in my tongue. And so I shut my mouth, while the ungodly laid wait for me.",
  "2": "I held my tongue, I was dumb, I kept silence, yea even from good words, but it was pain and grief to me.",
  "3": "My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing, the fire kindled: so that I spake with my tongue:",
  "4": "LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified what I want.",
  "5": "Behold, thou hast made my days a span long, and my life as it were nothing before thee. O how vain are all men living? Selah",
