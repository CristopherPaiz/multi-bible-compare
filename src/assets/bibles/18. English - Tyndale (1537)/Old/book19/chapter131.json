  "1": "The song of the stairs. LORD, I am not high minded, I have no proud looks. I do not exercise myself in great matters, which are too high for me.",
  "2": "But I refrain my soul and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned(weened) from his mother: Yea my soul is even as a weaned(weened) child.",
  "3": "Let Israel trust in the LORD, from this time forth for evermore."
