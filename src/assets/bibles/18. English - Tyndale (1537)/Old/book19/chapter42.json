  "1": "To the Chanter, a monition of the sons of Korah Like as the hart desireth the water brooks, so longeth my soul after thee, O God.",
  "2": "My soul is a thirst for God, yea even for the living God: when shall I come, and behold the face of God?",
  "3": "My tears are my meat day and night, while it is daily said unto me: Where is now thy God?",
  "4": "Now when I think there upon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I would fain go hence with the multitude, and pass over with them unto the house of God, in the voice of praise and thanksgiving, among such as keep holy day.",
  "5": "Why art thou so full of heaviness (O my soul) and why art thou so unquiet within me? O put thy trust in God, for I will yet give him thanks, for the help of his countenance.",
  "6": "My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore I remember the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermonim.",
  "7": "One deep calleth another with the voice of thy whistles, all thy waves(wawes) and water floods are gone over me.",
  "8": "The LORD hath promised his loving-kindness daily, therefore will I praise him in the night season, and make my prayer unto the God of my life.",
  "9": "I will say unto God my stony rock; Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?",
  "10": "While my bones are broken, and while mine enemies cast me in the teeth, daily saying unto me: Where is now thy God?",
  "11": "Why art thou so heavy (O my soul) and why art thou so disquieted within me? O put thy trust in God, for I will yet thank him for the help of his countenance, and because he is my God."
