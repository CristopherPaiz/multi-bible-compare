  "6": "I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, and like an owl in a broken wall.",
  "7": "I wake, and am even as it were a sparrow sitting alone upon the house top.",
  "8": "Mine enemies revile me all the day long, they laugh me to scorn, and are sworn together against me.",
  "9": "I eat ashes with my bread, and mingle my drink with weeping;",
  "10": "And that because of thine indignation and wrath, for thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.",
  "11": "My days are gone like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.",
  "12": "But thou, O LORD, endurest for ever, and thy remembrance thorowout all generations.",
  "13": "Arise therefore and have mercy upon Sion, for it is time to have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.",

  "25": "Thou LORD in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.",
  "26": "They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.",
