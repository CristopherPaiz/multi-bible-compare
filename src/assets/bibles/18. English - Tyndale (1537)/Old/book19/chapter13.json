  "1": "To the chanter, a Psalm of David How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?",
  "2": "Oh how long shall I seek counsel in my soul? how long shall I be so vexed in my heart? how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?",
  "3": "Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death.",
  "4": "Lest mine enemy say: I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.",
  "5": "But my trust is in thy mercy, and my heart is joyful in thy saving health.",
  "6": "I will sing of the LORD, that dealeth so lovingly with me. (Yea I will praise the name of the LORD the most highest.)(hyest)"
