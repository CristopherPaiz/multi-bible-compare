  "1": "My son, give heed unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my prudence:",
  "2": "that thou mayest regard good counsel, and that thy lips may keep nurture.",
  "3": "For the lips of an harlot are a dropping honeycomb, and her throat is softer than oil.",
  "4": "But at the last she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down unto death, and her steps pierce thorow unto hell.",
  "6": "She regardeth not the path of life, so unsteadfast are her ways, that thou canst not know them.",
  "7": "Hear me therefore, (O my son) and depart not from the words of my mouth.",
  "8": "Keep thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.",
  "9": "That thou give not thine honour unto another, and thy years to the cruel.",
  "10": "That other men be not filled with thy goods, and that thy labours come not in a strange house.",
  "11": "Yea that thou mourn not at the last, (when thou hast spent thy body and goods)",
  "12": "and then say: Alas, why hated I nurture? why did my heart despise correction?",
  "13": "Wherefore was not I obedient unto the voice of my teachers, and hearken not unto them that informed me?",
  "14": "I am come almost into all misfortune, in the middest of the multitude and congregation.",
  "15": "Drink of the water of thine own well, and of the rivers that run out of thine own springs.",
  "16": "Let thy wells flow out abroad, that there may be rivers of water in the streets:",
  "17": "but let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.",
  "18": "Let thy well be blessed, and be glad with the wife of thy youth.",
  "19": "Loving is the hind, and friendly is the Roo: let her breasts alway satisfy thee, and hold thee ever content with her love.",
  "20": "My son, why wilt thou have pleasure in an harlot, and embrace the bosom of another woman?",
  "21": "For every man's ways are open in the sight of the LORD, and he pondereth all their goings.",
  "22": "The wickedness of the ungodly shall catch himself, and with the snares of his own sins shall he be trapped.",
  "23": "Because he would not be reformed, he shall die: and for his great foolishness he shall be destroyed."
