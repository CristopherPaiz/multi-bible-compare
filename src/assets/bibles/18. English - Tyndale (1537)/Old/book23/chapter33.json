  "8": "The streets are waste, there walketh no man therein, the appointment is broken, the cities are dispised, they are not regarded,",
  "9": "the desolate earth is in heaviness. Libanus taketh it but for a sport, that it is hewn down: Saron is like a wilderness: Basan and Carmel are turned upside down.",
  "10": "And therefore sayeth the LORD. I will up, now will I get up, now will I arise.",
  "11": "Ye shall conceive stubble, and bear straw, and your spirit shall be the fire, that it may consume you:",

  "23": "There are the coards so laid abroad, that they can not be better: The mast set up of such a fashion, that no banner nor sail hangeth thereon: but there is dealed great spoil, yea lame men run after the prey;",
  "24": "There lieth no man that sayeth: I am sick, but all evil is taken away from the people, that dwell there."
