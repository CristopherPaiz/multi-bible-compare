  "2": "It will be also in process of time: That the hill where the house of the LORD is builded, shall be the chief among the hills, and exalted above all little hills. And all the Heathen shall prease unto him. And the multitude of people shall go unto him,(It shall come to pass in the last days that the mount of the house of the LORD, shall be set in the top of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills: and all nations shall resort thereto.)",
  "3": "speaking thus one unto another: up, let us go to the hill of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob: that he may shew us his way, and that we may walk in his paths. For the law shall come out of Sion, and the word of God from Jerusalem,(And much people shall go and say: come and let us go up to the hill of the LORD and unto the house of the God of Jacob: that he may teach us his ways, and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Sion shall come the law, and the word of God out of Jerusalem.)",
  "4": "and shall give sentence among the Heathen, and shall reform the multitude of people: So that they shall break their swords and spears, to make scythes, sicles and saws thereof. From that time forth shall not one people lift up weapon against another, neither shall they learn to fight from thenceforth.(And he shall be judge among the heathen and tell many nations their faults. And they shall turn their swords into mattocks and their spears into scythes. One nation shall not lift up a sword against another, neither shall they teach to war any more.)",
  "5": "It is to thee that I cry (O house of Jacob) up, let us walk in the light of the LORD.(O house of Jacob come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.)",
  "6": "But thou art scattered abroad with thy people (O house of Jacob) for ye go far beyond your fathers, whether it be in Sorcerers (who ye had as the Philistines had) or in calkers of men's births, whereof ye have too many.",
  "7": "As soon as your land was full of silver and gold, and no end of your treasure: so soon as your land was full of strong horses and no end of your chariots:",
  "8": "Immediately was it full of Idols also, even works of your own hands, which ye yourselves have fashioned, and your fingers have made.",

  "11": "Which casteth down the high looks of presumptuous persons, and bringeth low the pride of man, and he only shall be exalted in the day.",
  "12": "For the day of the LORD of Hosts shall go over all pride and presumption, upon all them that exalt themselves, and shall bring them all down:",
  "13": "upon all high stout Cedar trees of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan,",
