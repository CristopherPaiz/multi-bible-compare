  "1": "But who giveth credence unto our preaching? Or to whom is the arm of the LORD known?(Who believeth our sayings, and the arm of the LORD, to whom is it opened?)",
  "2": "He shall grow before the Lord(LORDE) like as a branch, and as a root in a dry ground, he shall have neither beauty nor favour. When we look upon him, there shall be no fairness: we shall have no lust unto him.(He came up as a spray before him, and as a root out of a dry land. There was neither fashion or beauty on him. And when we looked on him, there was no godliness that we should lust after him.)",
  "3": "He shall be the most simple, and despised of all, which yet hath good experience of sorrows and infirmities. We shall reckon him so simple and so vile, that we shall hide our faces from him.(He was despised and cast out of men's company, and one that had suffered sorrow, and had experience of infirmity: and we were as one that had hid his face from him.)",
  "4": "How be it (of a truth) he only taketh away our infirmity, and beareth our pain: Yet we shall judge him, as though he were plagued and cast down of God:(He was so despisable, that we esteemed him not. Truly he took upon him our diseases, and bare our sorrows. And yet we counted him plagued, and beaten and humbled of God.)",
  "5": "where as he (notwithstanding) shall be wounded for our offenses, and smitten for our wickedness. For the pain of our punishment shall be laid upon him, and with his stripes shall we be healed.(He was wounded for our transgression, and bruised for our iniquities. The correction that brought us peace was on him, and with his stripes we were healed.)",
  "6": "As for us, we go all astray (like sheep) everyone turneth his own way. But thorow him, the LORD pardoneth all our sins.(And we went astray as sheep, and turned every man his way: and the LORD put on him the wickedness of us all.)",
  "7": "He shall be pained and troubled, and shall not open his mouth. He shall be led as a sheep to be slain, yet shall he be as still as a lamb before the shearer, and not open his mouth.(He suffered wrong and was evil entreated, and yet opened not his mouth: he was as a sheep led to be slain: and as a lamb before his shearer, he was dumb and opened not his mouth.)",
  "8": "He shall be had away, his cause not heard, and with out any judgement: Whose generation yet no man may number, when he shall be cut off from the ground of the living: Which punishment shall go upon him, for the transgression of my people.(By the reason of the affliction, he was not esteemed: and yet his generation who can number? When he is taken from the earth of living men: for my people's transgression he was plagued.)",
  "9": "His grave shall be given him with the condemned, and his crucifying with the thieves. Where as he did never violence nor unright, neither hath there been any deceitfulness in his mouth.(He put his sepulchre with the wicked, and with the rich in his death: because he did none iniquity, neither was guile found in his mouth.)",
  "10": "Yet hath it pleased the LORD to smite him with infirmity, that when he had made his soul an offering for sin, he might see (a) long lasting seed. And this device of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.(And yet the LORD determined to bruise him with infirmities. His soul giving herself for trangression, he shall see seed of long continuance, and the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.)",
  "11": "With travail and labour of his soul, shall he obtain great riches. My righteous servant shall with his wisdom justify and deliver the multitude, for he shall bear away their sins.(Because of the labour of his soul, he shall see and be satisfied. With his knowledge, he being just, shall justify my servants and that a great number: and he shall bear their iniquities.)",
  "12": "Therefore will I give him the multitude for his part, and he shall divide the strong spoil because he shall give over his soul to death, and shall be reckoned among the transgressors, which nevertheless shall take away the sins of the multitude, and make intercession for the misdoers.(Therefore I will give him his part in many and the spoil of the rich he shall divide: because he gave his soul to death, and was numbered with the trespassers, and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for transgressors.)"
