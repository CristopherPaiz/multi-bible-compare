  "1": "But now, the LORD that made thee O Jacob, and he that fashioned thee O Israel, sayeth thus: Fear not, for I will defend thee. I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine own.",
  "2": "When thou wentest in the water, I was by thee, that the strong floods should not pluck thee away. When thou walkest in the fire, it shall not burn thee, and the flame shall not kindle upon thee.",
  "3": "For I am the LORD thy God, the holy one of Israel, thy Saviour. I gave Egypt for thy deliverance, the Morians and the Sabees for thee:",
  "4": "because thou wast dear in my sight, and because I set by thee, and loved thee. I pilled all men for thee, and delivered up all people for thy sake,",
  "5": "that thou shouldest not fear, for I was with thee. I will bring thy seed from the East, and gather thee together from the West.",
  "6": "I will say to the North, let go. And to the South, keep not back: but bring me my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the world:",
  "7": "Namely, all those that be called after my name: For them have I created, fashioned, and made for mine honour.",
  "8": "Bring forth that people, whether they have eyes, or be blind, deaf or have ears.",
  "9": "All nations shall come in one, and be gathered in one people. But which among yonder gods shall declare such things, and tell us what is to come? Let them bring their witnesses, so shall they be free: for then men shall hear it, and say, it is truth.",
  "10": "But I bring you witnesses (sayeth the LORD) even those that are my servants, whom I have chosen: to the intent that ye might be certified and give me faithful credence: yea and to consider, that I am he, before whom there was never any God, and that there shall be none after me.",
  "11": "I am only the LORD, and without me is there no Saviour.",
  "12": "I give warning, I make whole, I teach you that there should be no strange God among you. And this record must ye bear me yourselves, (sayeth the LORD) that I am God.",
  "13": "And even he am I from the beginning, and there is none that can take any thing out of my hand. And what I do, can no man change.",
  "14": "Thus sayeth the LORD the holy one of Israel your redeemer: For your sake I will send to Babylon, and bring all the strongest of them from hence: Namely, the Chaldees that boost them of their ships:",
  "15": "Even I the LORD your holy one, which have made Israel, and am your King.",
  "16": "Moreover, thus sayeth the LORD, (even he) that maketh a way in the sea, and a footpath in the mighty waters:",
  "17": "Which bringeth forth the chariots and horses, the host and the power, that they may fall asleep and never rise, and be extinct, like as towe is quenched.",
  "18": "Ye remember not things of old, and regard nothing that is past.",
  "19": "Therefore behold, I shall make a new thing, and shortly shall it appear: ye shall well know it, I told it you afore, but I will tell it you again. I will make streets in the desert, and rivers of water in the wilderness.",
  "20": "The wild beasts shall worship me: the dragon, and the Ostrich. For I shall give water in the wilderness, and streams in the desert: that I may give drink to my people, whom I choose.",
  "21": "This people have I made for myself, and they shall shew forth my praise.",
  "22": "For thou (Jacob) wouldest not call upon me, but thou hadst an unlust toward me, O Israel.",
  "23": "Thou gavest me not thy young beasts for burnt offerings, neither didst honour me with thy sacrifices. Though boughtest me no dear spice with thy money, neither pourest the fat of thy sacrifices upon me. Howbeit I have not been chargeable unto thee in offerings, neither grievous in incense.",
  "24": "But thou hast laden me with thy sins, and wearied me with thine ungodliness.",
  "25": "Where as I yet am even he only, that for mine own self's sake do away thine offenses, and forget thy sins: so that I will never think upon them.",
  "26": "Put me now in remembrance, for we will reason together, and shew what thou hast for thee, to make thee quite.",
  "27": "Thy first father offended sore, and thy rulers have sinned against me.",
  "28": "Therefore I either suspended, or slew the chiefest princes: I did curse Jacob, and gave Israel into reproof."
