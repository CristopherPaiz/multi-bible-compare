  "4": "I will deliver Egypt also into the hands of grievous rulers, and a cruel king shall have the rule of them. (sayeth the Lord GOD of Hosts)",

  "11": "Yea the indiscreet princes of Zoan, the counsel of the wise Senators of Pharaoh, shall turn to foolishness: Those that dare boast and say of Pharaos behalf: I am come of wise people,",
  "12": "I am come of the old regal Progeny. But where are now thy wise men? Let them tell thee and shew thee, what the LORD of Hosts hath taken in hand against Egypt.",
  "13": "Fools are those princes of Zoan, and proud are the princes of Noph: yea they deceive Egypt with their nobility of their stock.",
  "14": "For the LORD hath made Egypt drunken with the spirit of error, and they shall use it in all matters: even like as a drunken man goeth spewing about.",
