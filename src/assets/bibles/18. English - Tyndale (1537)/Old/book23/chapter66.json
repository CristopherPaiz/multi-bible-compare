  "1": "Thus sayeth the LORD: Heaven is my seat, and the earth is my footstool. Where shall now the house stand, that ye build unto me? And where shall be the place, that I will dwell in?",
  "2": "As for these things, my hand hath made them all, and they are all created, sayeth the LORD. Which of them shall I then regard? Even him that is of a lowly troubled spirit, and standeth in awe of my works.",
  "3": "For who so slayeth an ox for me, doth me so great dishonour, as he that killeth a man. He that killeth a sheep for me, choketh a dog. He that bringeth me meat offerings, offereth swine's blood: Who so maketh me a memorial of incense, praiseth the thing that is unright. Yet take they such ways in hand, and their soul delighteth in these abominations.",
  "4": "Therefore will I also have pleasure in laughing them to scorn, and the thing that they fear, will I bring upon them. For when I called no man gave answer: when I spake, they would not hear: But did wickedness before mine eyes, and chose the things that displease me.",
  "5": "Hear the word of God all ye, that fear the thing which he speaketh. Your brethren that hate you, and cast you out for my name's sake, say: Let the LORD magnify himself, that we may see your gladness: and yet they shall be confounded.",
  "6": "For as touching the city and the temple, I hear the voice of the LORD, that will reward, and recompense his enemies:",
  "7": "like as when a wife bringeth forth a man child, or ever she suffer the pain of the birth and anguish of the travail.",
  "8": "Who ever heard or saw such things? doth the ground bear in one day? or are the people born all at once, as Sion beareth her(his) sons?",
  "9": "For thus sayeth the LORD: Am I he that maketh other to bear, and bear not myself? Am not I he that beareth, and maketh barren? sayeth thy God.",
  "10": "Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her. Be joyful with her, all ye that mourned for her.",
  "11": "For ye shall suck comfort out of her breasts, and be satisfied. Ye shall taste, and have delight in the plenteousness of her power.",
  "12": "For thus sayeth the LORD: behold, I will let peace into her, like a water flood, and the might of the Heathen like a flowing stream. Then shall ye suck, ye shall be born upon her sides, and be joyful upon her knees.",
  "13": "For like as a child is comforted of his mother, so shall I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.",
  "14": "And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb. Thus shall the hand of the LORD be known among his servants, and his indignation among his enemies.",
  "15": "For behold, the LORD shall come with fire, and his chariot shall be like a whirlwind, that he may recompense his vengeance in his wrath, and his indignation with the flame of fire.",
  "16": "For the LORD shall judge all flesh with the fire and with his sword, and there shall be a great number slain of the LORD.",
  "17": "Such as have made themselves holy and clean in the gardens, and those that have eaten swine's flesh, mice, and other abominations, shall be taken away together, sayeth the LORD.",
  "18": "For I will come to gather all people and tongues with their works and imaginations: these shall come, and see my glory.",
  "19": "Unto them shall I give a token, and send certain of them (that be delivered) among the Gentiles: into Celicia, Africa and Lidia (where men can handle bows) into Italy also and Greekland. The isles far off, that have not heard speak of me, and have not seen my glory, shall preach my praise among the Gentiles",
  "20": "and shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD, out of all people, upon horses, chariots and horse litters, upon Mules and carts to Jerusalem my holy hill (sayeth the LORD) like as the children of Israel bring the offering in clean vessels, to the house of the LORD.",
  "21": "And I shall take out certain of them for to be priests and levites, sayeth the LORD.",
  "22": "For like as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make, shall be fast established by me: (sayeth the LORD) So shall your seed and your name continue,",
  "23": "and there shall be a new Moon for the other, and a new Sabbath for the other, and all flesh shall come to worship before me (sayeth the LORD.)",
  "24": "And they shall go forth and look upon the carrions of them that have transgressed against me. For their worms shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and all flesh shall abhor them. [The end of the book of the Prophete Esai.]"
