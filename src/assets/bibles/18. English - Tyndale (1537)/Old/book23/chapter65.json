  "1": "They shall seek me, that hitherto have not asked for me, they shall find me, that hitherto have not sought me. Then shall I say immediately to the people that never called upon my name: I am here, I am here.",
  "2": "For thus long have I ever holden out my hands to an unfaithful people, that go not the right way, but after their own imaginations:",
  "3": "To a people that is ever defying me to my face. They make their oblations in gardens, and their smoke upon altars of brick,",
  "4": "they lurk among the graves, and lie in the dens all night. They eat swine flesh, and unclean broth is in their vessels.",
  "5": "If thou comest nigh them, they say: touch me not, for I am holier than thou. All these men when I am angry, shall be turned to smoke and fire, that shall burn for ever.",

  "7": "I mean your misdeeds, and the misdeeds of your fathers together (sayeth the LORD) which have made their smokes upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their old deeds into their bosom again.",
  "8": "Moreover thus sayeth the LORD: like as when one would gather holy grapes, men say unto him: break it not off, for it is holy: even so will I do also for my servants' sakes, that I will not destroy them all.",
  "9": "But I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one, to take possession of my hill. My chosen shall possess these things, and my servants shall dwell there.",
  "10": "Saron shall be a sheepfold, and the valley of Achor shall give the stalling for the cattle of my people, that fear me.",
  "11": "But as for you, ye are they, that have forsake the LORD, and forgotten my holy hill. Ye have set up an altar to fortune, and given rich drink offerings unto treasure.",
  "12": "Therefore will I number you with the sword, that ye shall be destroyed all together. For when I called, no man gave me answer: when I spake, ye hearkened not unto me, but did wickedness before mine eyes, and chose the thing that pleased me not.",
  "13": "Therefore thus sayeth the Lord GOD:(LORDE God) Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall have hunger. Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall suffer thirst. Behold, my servants shall be merry, but ye shall be confounded.",
  "14": "Behold, my servants shall rejoice for very quietness of heart: But ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and complain for vexation of mind.",
  "15": "Your name shall not be sworn by among my chosen, for GOD the Lord(LORDE) shall slay you, and call his servants by another name.",
  "16": "Whoso rejoiceth upon earth, shall rejoice in the true God: And whoso sweareth upon earth, shall swear in the true God. For the old enmity shall be forgotten, and taken away out of my sight.",
  "17": "For lo, I shall make a new heaven, and a new earth. And as for the old, they shall never be thought upon, nor kept in mind:",
  "18": "but men shall be glad and evermore rejoice, for the things, that I shall do. For why: Behold, I shall make a joyful Jerusalem,",
  "19": "yea I myself will rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with my people: And the voice of weeping and wailing shall not be heard in her from thence forth.",
  "20": "There shall never be child nor old man, that have not their full days. But when the child cometh to an hundredth year old, it shall die. And if he that is an hundredth year of age do wrong, he shall be cursed.",
  "21": "They shall build houses, and dwell in them: they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.",
  "22": "They shall not build, and another possess: they shall not plant, and another eat: But the life of my people shall be like a tree, and so shall the work of their hands.",
  "23": "My chosen shall live long, they shall not labour in vain, nor beget with trouble: for they are the high(hie) blessed seed of the LORD, and their fruits with them.",
  "24": "And it shall be, that or ever they call, I shall answer them. While they are yet but thinking how to speak, I shall hear them.",
  "25": "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat hay like the bullock. But earth shall be the serpent's meat. There shall no man hurt nor slay another, in all my holy hill, sayeth the LORD."
