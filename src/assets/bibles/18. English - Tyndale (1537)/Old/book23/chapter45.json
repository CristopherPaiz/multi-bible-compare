  "2": "I will go before thee, and make the crooked straight. I shall break the brazen doors, and burst the iron bars.",
  "3": "I shall give thee the hid treasure and the thing which is secretly kept: that thou mayest know, that I the God of Israel have called thee by thy name:",

  "5": "Even I the LORD, before whom there is none other: for without me there is no God. I have prepared the or ever thou knewest me:",
  "6": "that it might be known from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, that all is nothing without me. For I am the LORD, and there is else none.",
  "7": "It is I that created the light, and darkness, I make peace, and trouble: yea even I the LORD do all these things.",
  "8": "The heavens above shall drop down, and the clouds shall rain righteousness. The earth shall open itself, and bring forth health, and thereby shall righteousness flourish. Even I the LORD shall bring it to pass.",
  "9": "Woe be unto him that chideth with his maker, the potsherd with the potter: Sayeth the clay to the potter: What makest thou? or thy work serveth for nothing?",

They shall fall down before thee, and make supplication unto thee. For God (without whom there is none other God) shall be with thee.",
  "15": "O how profound art thou O God, thou God and Saviour of Israel?",
  "16": "Confounded be ye, and put to dishonour: go hence together with shame, all ye that be workmasters of error: (that is worshipers of Idols)",
  "17": "But Israel shall be saved in the LORD, which is the everlasting salvation: They shall not come to shame nor confusion, world without end.",
  "18": "For thus sayeth the LORD: even he that created heaven, the God that made the earth, that fashioned it, and set it forth: I have not made it for naught, but I made it to be inhabited. Even I the LORD, without whom there is none other.",
  "19": "I have not spoken secretly, neither in dark places of the earth. It is not for naught, that I said unto the seed of Jacob: Seek me. I am the LORD, which when I speak, declareth the thing that is righteous and true.",

  "21": "Let men draw nigh, let them come hither, and ask counsel one at another, and shew forth: What is he, that told this before? or, who spake of it, ever since the beginning?

  "22": "And therefore turn you unto me (all ye ends of the earth) so shall ye be saved, for I am God, and there is else none.",
  "23": "I swear by myself: out of my mouth cometh the word of righteousness, and that may no man turn: but all knees shall bow unto me, and all tongues shall swear by me,",
  "24": "saying: Verily in the LORD is my righteousness and strength. To him shall men come: but all they that think scorn of him, shall be confounded.",
  "25": "And the whole seed of Israel shall be justified, and praised in the LORD."
