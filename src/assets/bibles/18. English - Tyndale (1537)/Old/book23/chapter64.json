  "1": "O that thou wouldest cleave the heaven in sunder, and come down: that the mountains might melt away at thy presence,",
  "2": "like as at an hot fire that the malicious might boil, as the water doth upon the fire: Whereby thy name might be known among thine enemies, and that the Gentiles might tremble before thee.",
  "3": "That thou mightest come down with thy wonderous strange works, then should the hills melt at thy presence.",
  "4": "For since the beginning of the world there was none (except thou O God) that heard or perceived, neither hath any eye seen what thou doest for them, that put their trust in thee.",
  "5": "Thou helpest him that doth right with cheerfulness, and them that think upon thy ways. But lo, thou art angry, for we offend, and have been ever in sin, and there is not one whole.",
  "6": "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as the clothes stained with the flours of a woman: we fall every each one as the leaf, for our sins carry us away like the wind.",

  "11": "Our holy house which is our beauty, where our fathers praised thee, is brent up: yea all our commodities and pleasures are wasted away.",
  "12": "Wilt thou not be intreated (LORD) for all this? Wilt thou hold thy peace, and scourge us so sore?"
