  "1": "Behold, the LORD's hand is not so shortened that it can not help, neither is his ear so stopped that it may not hear.",
  "2": "But your misdeeds have separated you from your God, and your sins hide his face from you, that he heareth you not.",
  "3": "For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with unrighteousness: Your lips speak leasings, and your tongue setteth out wickedness.",
  "4": "No man regardeth righteousness, and no man judgeth truly. Every man hopeth in vain things, and imagineth deceit, conceiveth weariness, and bringeth forth evil.",
  "5": "They breed cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web. Whoso eateth of their eggs dieth. But if one treadeth upon them, there cometh up a serpent.",
  "6": "Their web maketh no cloth and they may not cover themselves with their labours. Their deeds are the deeds of wickedness, and the work of robbery is in their hands.",
  "7": "Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their counsels are wicked counsels, harm and destruction are in their ways.",
  "8": "But the way of peace they know not. In their goings is no equity, their ways are so crocked that whosoever goeth therein, knoweth nothing of peace.",
  "9": "And this is the cause that equity is so far from us, and that righteousness cometh not nigh us. We look for light, lo, it is darkness: for the morning shine, see, we walk in the dark.",
  "10": "We grope like the blind upon the wall, we grope even as one that hath none eyes. We stumble at the noon day, as though it were toward night: in the falling places, like men that are half dead.",
  "11": "We roar all like Bears, and mourn still like doves. We look for equity, but there is none: for health, but it is far from us.",
  "12": "For our offenses are many before thee, and our sins testify against us. Yea we must confess that we offend and knowledge, that we do amiss:",
  "13": "Namely transgress and dissemble against the LORD, and fall away from our God: using presumptuous and traitorous imaginations, and casting false matters in our hearts.",
  "14": "And therefore is equity gone aside, and righteousness standeth far off: truth is fallen down in the street, and the thing that is plain and open, may not be shewed.",
  "15": "Yea the truth is laid in prison, and he that refraineth him self from evil, must be spoiled. When the LORD saw this, it displeased him sore, that there was no where any equity.",
  "16": "He saw also, that there was no man, which had pity thereof, or was grieved at it. And he held him by his own power, and cleaved to his own righteousness.",
  "17": "He put righteousness upon him for a breast plate, and set the helmet of health upon his head. He put on wrath in stead of clothing, and took jealousy about him for a cloak:",
  "18": "(like as when a man goeth forth wrothfully to recompense his enemies, and to be avenged of his adversaries.) Namely, that he might recompense and reward the Islands,",
  "19": "where thorow the name of the LORD might be feared, from the rising of the Sun:(Sone) and his majesty, unto the going down of the same. For he shall come as a violent water stream, which the wind of the LORD hath moved.",
  "20": "But unto Sion there shall come a redeemer, and unto them in Jacob that turn from wickedness, sayeth the LORD.",
  "21": "I will make this covenant with them, (sayeth the LORD): My spirit that is come upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy mouth, shall never go out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy children, nor out of the mouth of thy children's children, from this time forth for evermore."
