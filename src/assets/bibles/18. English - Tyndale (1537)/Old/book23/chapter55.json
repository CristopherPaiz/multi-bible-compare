  "1": "Come to the waters all ye, that be thirsty, and ye that have no money. Come, buy, that ye may have to eat. Come, buy wine and milk, without any money, or money worth.",
  "2": "Wherefore do ye lay out your money, for the thing that feedeth not, and spend your labour about the thing that satisfieth you not. But hearken rather unto me, and ye shall eat of the best, and your soul shall have her pleasure in plenteousness.",
  "3": "Incline your ears, and come unto me, take heed, and your soul shall live. For I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.",
  "4": "Behold, I shall give him for a witness among the folk, for a Prince and Captain unto the people.",
  "5": "Lo, thou shalt call an unknown people: and a people that had no knowledge of thee, shall run unto thee: because of the LORD thy God, the holy one of Israel, which glorifieth thee.",
  "6": "Seek the LORD, while he may be found, and call upon him while he is nigh.",
  "7": "Let the ungodly man forsake his ways and the unrighteous his imaginations, and turn again unto the LORD: so shall he be merciful unto him: and to our God, for he is ready to forgive.",
  "8": "For thus sayeth the LORD: my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways,",
  "9": "but as far as the heavens are higher than the earth, so far do my ways exceed yours, and my thoughts yours.",
  "10": "And like as the rain and snow cometh down from heaven, and returneth not thither again, but watereth the earth, maketh it fruitful and green, that it may give corn and bread unto the sower:",
  "11": "So the word also that cometh out of my mouth shall not turn again void unto me, but shall accomplish my will and prosper in the thing, whereto I sent it.",
  "12": "And so shall ye go forth with joy, and be lead with peace. The mountains and hills shall sing with you for joy, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.",
  "13": "For thorns, there shall grow Fir trees, and the Myrtle tree in the stead of briers. And this shall be done to the praise of the LORD, and for an everlasting token, that shall not be taken away."
