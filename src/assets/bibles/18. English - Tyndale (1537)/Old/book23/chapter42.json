  "1": "Behold now therefore, this is my servant whom I will keep to myself: mine elect; In whom my soul shall be pacified. I will give him my spirit, that he may shew forth judgement and equity among the Gentiles.",
  "2": "He shall not be an outcrier, nor an high minded person. His voice shall not be heard in the streets.",
  "3": "A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: but faithfully and truly shall he give judgement.",
  "4": "He shall neither be overseen nor hasty, that he may restore righteousness unto the earth: and the Gentiles also shall keep his laws.",
  "5": "For thus sayeth God the LORD unto him (even he that made the heavens, and spread them abroad, and set forth the earth with her increase: which giveth breath unto the people that is in it, and to them that dwell therein)",
  "6": "I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and led thee by the hand. Therefore will I also defend thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, and to be the light of the Gentiles.",
  "7": "That thou mayest open the eyes of the blind, let out the prisoners, and them that sit in darkness, out of the dungeon house.",
  "8": "I my self, whose name is the LORD, which give my power to none other, neither mine honour to the gods:",
  "9": "Shew you these new tidings, and tell you them or they come, for old things also are come to pass.",
  "10": "Sing therefore unto the LORD, a new song of thanks giving, blow out his praise unto the end of the world. They that be upon the sea, and all that is therein, praise him, the Isles and they that dwell in them.",
  "11": "Let the wilderness with her cities lift up her voice, the towns also that be in Cedar. Let them be glad that sit upon rocks of stone, and let them cry down from the high mountains:",
  "12": "ascribing almightiness unto the LORD, and magnifying him among the Gentiles.",
  "13": "The LORD shall come forth as a giant, and take a stomach to himself like a fresh man of war. He shall roar and cry, and overcome his enemies.",
  "14": "I have long time holden my peace, (sayeth the LORD) should I therefore be still, and keep silence for ever? I will cry like a travailing woman, and once will I destroy, and devour.",
  "15": "I will make waste both mountain and hill, and dry up every green thing that groweth thereon. I will dry up the floods of water, and drink up the rivers.",
  "16": "I will bring the blind into the street, that they know not: and lead them in to a foot path, that they are ignorant in. I shall make darkness light before them, and the thing that is crooked to be straight. These things will I do, and not forget them.",
  "17": "And therefore let them convert, and be ashamed earnestly, that hope in Idols, and say to fashioned images: ye are our gods.",
  "18": "Hear, O ye deaf men, and sharpen your sights to see (O ye blind)",
  "19": "But who is blinder, than my servant? Or so deaf, as my messengers, whom I send unto thee? For who is so blind as my people, and they that have the rule of them?(For who is so blind (fay they) as the perfect man and so blind as the LORD's servant?)",
  "20": "They are like, as if thou understoodest much, and keptest nothing: or if one heard well, but were not obedient.",
  "21": "The LORD be merciful unto them for his righteousness' sake, that his word might be magnified and praised.",
  "22": "But it is a mischevious and wicked people. Their young men belong all to the snare, and shall be shut into prison houses. They shall be carried away captive, and no man shall loosen(lowse) them. They shall be trodden under foot, and no man shall labour to bring them again.",
  "23": "But who is he among you, that pondereth this in his mind, that considereth it, and taketh it for a warning in time to come?",
  "24": "Who suffered Jacob to be trodden under foot, and Israel to be spoiled? Did not the LORD? Now have we sinned against him, and have had no delight to walk in his ways, neither been obedient unto his law.",
  "25": "Therefore hath he poured upon us his wrathful displeasure, and strong battle, which maketh us have to do on every side, yet will we not understand: He burneth us up, yet sinketh it not in to our hearts."
