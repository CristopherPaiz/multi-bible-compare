  "1": "Hear this, O thou house of Jacob: ye that are called by the name of Israel, and are come out of one stock with Judah: which swear by the name of the LORD, and bear witness by the God of Israel (but not with truth and right)",
  "2": "which are called free men of the holy city, as they that look for comfort in the God of Israel, whose name is the LORD of Hosts.",
  "3": "The things that I shewed you ever since the beginning: Have I not brought them to pass, immediately as they came out of my mouth, and declared them? And they are come?",
  "4": "Howbeit I knew that thou art obstinate, and that thy neck hath an iron vein, and thy brow is of brass.",
  "5": "Nevertheless, I have ever since the beginning shewed thee of things for to come, and declared them unto thee, or ever they came to pass: that thou shouldest not say: mine Idol hath done it, my carved or cast image hath shewed it:",
  "6": "Hear and consider all these things whether it was ye that prophesied them: But as for me, I told thee before at the beginning, new and secret things that thou knewest not of:",
  "7": "And some done now not of old time, whereof thou never heardest, before they were brought to pass: that thou can not say: I knew of them.",
  "8": "Moreover there be some whereof thou hast neither heard nor know, neither have they been open unto thine ears afore time. For I know that thou wouldest maliciously offend, therefore have I called thee a transgressor, even from thy mother's womb.",
  "9": "Nevertheless for my name's sake, I have withdrawn my wrath, and for mine honour's sake I have overseen thee, so that I have not rooted the out.",
  "10": "Behold, I have purged thee, and not for money. I have chosen thee in the fire of poverty;",
  "11": "And that only for mine own sake, for I give mine honour to none other, that thou shouldest not despise me.",
  "12": "Hearken unto me O Jacob, and Israel whom I have called. I am even he that is, I am the first and the last.",
  "13": "My hand is the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spanneth over the heavens. As soon as I called them they were there.",
  "14": "Gather you all together, and hearken: Which of yonder gods hath declared this, that the LORD will do by the king of Babylon (whom he loveth and favoureth) and by the Chaldees his arm?",
  "15": "I myself alone have told you this before. Yea I shall call him and bring him forth, and give him a prosperous journey.",
  "16": "Come nigh and hear this: have I spoken anything darkly since the beginning? when a thing begineth, I am there. Wherefore the Lord GOD(LORDE God) with his spirit hath sent me;",
  "17": "And thus sayeth the LORD God thine avenger, the holy one of Israel: I am the LORD thy God, which teach thee profitable things, and lead thee the way, that thou shouldest go.",
  "18": "If thou wilt now regard my commandment, thy wealthiness shall be as the water stream: and thy righteousness as the waves flowing in the sea.",
  "19": "Thy seed shall be like as the sand in the sea, and the fruit of thy body, like the gravel stones thereof: Thy name shall not be rooted out, nor destroyed before me.",
  "20": "Ye shall go away from Babylon, and escape the Chaldees with a merry voice. This shall be spoken of, declared abroad, and go forth unto the end of the world: so that it shall be said: The LORD hath defended his servant Jacob,",
  "21": "that they suffered no thirst, when they travailed in the wilderness. He clave the rocks a sunder, and the water gushed out.",
  "22": "As for the ungodly, they have no peace, sayeth the LORD."
