  "1": "This is the vision that was shewed unto Abdy: Thus hath the Lord GOD(LORDE God) spoken upon Edom: We have heard of the LORD that there is an embassage sent among the Heathen: Up, let us arise, and fight against them.",
  "2": "Behold, I will make thee small among the Heathen, so that thou shalt be utterly despised.",
  "3": "The pride of thine heart hath lift thee up, thou that dwellest in the strong holds of stone, and hast made thee an high seat: Thou sayest in thine heart: who shall cast me down to the ground?",
  "4": "But though thou wentest up as high as the Aegle, and madest thy nest above among the stars: yet would I pluck thee down from thence.",
  "5": "If the thieves and robbers came to thee by night, thou taking thy rest: should they not steal, till they had enough? If the grape gatherers came upon thee, would they not leave thee some grapes?",
  "6": "But how shall they rip Esau, and seek out his treasures?",
  "7": "Yea the men that were sworn unto thee, shall drive thee out of the borders of thine own land. They that be now at one with thee, shall deceive thee, and overcome thee: Even they that eat thy bread, shall betray thee, or ever thou perceive it.",
  "8": "Shall not I at the same time destroy the wise men of Edom, and those that have understanding, from the mount of Esau?",
  "9": "Thy giants (O Theman) shall be afraid, for thorow the slaughter they shall be all overthrown upon the mount of Esau.",
  "10": "Shame shall come upon thee, for the malice that thou shewedest to thy brother Jacob: yea for evermore shalt thou perish,",
  "11": "and that because of the time, when thou didst set thy self against him, even when the enemies carried away his host, and when the aliens(aleauntes) came in at his ports, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, and thou thyself wast as one of them.",
  "12": "Thou shalt no more see the day of thy brother, thou shalt no more behold the time of his captivity: thou shalt no more rejoice over the children of Juda, in the day of their destruction, thou shalt triumph no more in the time of their trouble.",
  "13": "Thou shalt no more come in at the gates of my people, in the time of their decay: thou shalt not see their misery in the day of their fall. Thou shalt send out no man against their host, in the day of their adversity:",
  "14": "neither shalt thou stand(stode) waiting anymore at the corners of the streets, to murder such as are fled, or to take them prisoners, that remain in the day of their trouble.",
  "15": "For the day of the LORD is hard by upon all Heathen. Like as thou hast done, so shalt thou be dealt withal, yea thou shalt be rewarded even upon thine head.",
  "16": "For like wise as ye have drunken upon mine holy hill, so shall all Heathen drink continually: yea drink shall they, and swallow up, so that ye shall be, as though ye had never been.",
  "17": "But upon the mount Sion, there shall a remnant escape: these shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess even those, that had them selves afore in possession.",
  "18": "Moreover, the house of Jacob shall be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau the straw: which they shall kindle and consume, so that nothing shall be left of the house of Esau, for the LORD himself hath said it.",
  "19": "They of the South shall have the mount of Esau in possession: and look what lieth upon the ground, that shall the Philistines have: the plain fields shall Ephraim and Samaria possess: and the mountains of Gilead shall Benjamin have.",
  "20": "And this host shall be the children of Israel's prisoners: Now what so lieth from Canaan unto Zareptah, and in Sepharad, that shall be under the subjection of Jerusalem: and the cities of the south shall inherit it.",
  "21": "Thus they that escape upon the hill of Sion, shall go up to punish the mount of Esau, and the kingdom shall be the LORD's. [The end of the book of the Prophecye of Abdy.]"
