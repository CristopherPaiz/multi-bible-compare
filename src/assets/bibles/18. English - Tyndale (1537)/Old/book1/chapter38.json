  "1": "And it fortuned at that time that Judas went from his brethren and gat him to a man called Hira of Odollam,",
  "2": "and there he saw the daughter of a man called Sua a Cananite. And he took her and went in unto her.",
  "3": "And she conceived and bare a son and called his name Er.",
  "4": "And she conceived again and bare a son and called him Onan.",
  "5": "And she conceived the third time and bare a son, whom she called Sela: and he was at Chesib when she bare him.",
  "6": "And Judas gave Er his eldest son, a wife whose name was Thamar.",
  "7": "But this Er Juda's eldest son was wicked in the sight of the LORD, wherefore the LORD slew him.",
  "8": "Then said Judas unto Onan: go in to thy brother's wife and marry her, and stir up seed unto thy brother.",
  "9": "And when Onan perceived that the seed should not be his: therefore when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled it on the ground, because he would not give seed unto his brother.",
  "10": "And the thing which he did, displeased the LORD, wherefore he slew him also.",
  "11": "Then said Juda to Thamar his daughter-in-law: remain a widow at thy father's house, till Sela my son be grown: for he feared lest he should have died also, as his brethren did. Thus went Thamar and dwelt in her father's house.",
  "12": "And in process of time, the daughter of Sua Juda's wife died. Then Judas when he had left mourning, went unto his sheep shearers to Thimnath with his friend Hira of Odollam.",
  "13": "And one told Thamar saying: behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Thimnath, to shear his sheep.",
  "14": "And she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a cloak, and disguised herself: And sat her down at the entering of Enaim which is by the high way's side to Thimnath, for because she saw that Sela was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.",
  "15": "When Juda saw her he thought it had been an whore, because she had covered her face.",
  "16": "And turned to her unto the way and said, come I pray thee, let me lie with thee, for he knew not that it was his daughter-in-law. And she said what wilt thou give me, for to lie with me?",
  "17": "Then said he, I will send thee a kid from the flock. She answered: Then give me a pledge till thou send it.",
  "18": "Then said he, what pledge shall I give thee? And she said: thy signet, thy necklace, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave it her and lay by her, and she was with child by him.",
  "19": "And she gat her up and went and put her mantle from her, and put on her widow's raiment again.",
  "20": "And Judas sent the kid by his neighbour of Odollam, for to fetch out his pledge again from the wife's hand. But he found her not.",
  "21": "Then asked he the men of the same place saying: where is the whore that sat at Enaim in the way? And they said: there was no whore here.",
  "22": "And he came to Juda again saying: I can not find her, and also the men of the place said: that there was no whore there.",
  "23": "And Juda said: let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: for I sent the kid and thou couldest not find her.",
  "24": "And it came to pass that after three months, one told Juda saying: Thamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the whore, and with playing the whore is become great with child. And Juda said: bring her forth and let her be brent.",
  "25": "And when they brought her forth, she sent to her father-in-law saying: by the man unto whom these things pertain, am I with child. And said also: look whose are this seal, necklace, and staff.",
  "26": "And Juda knew them saying: she is more righteous than I, because I gave her not to Sela my son. But he lay with her no more.",
  "27": "When time was come that she should be delivered, behold there was two twins in her womb.",
  "28": "And as she travailed, the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound a red thread about it saying: this will come out first.",
  "29": "But he plucked his hand back again, and his brother came out. And she said: wherefore hast thou rent a rent upon thee? and called him Pharez.",
  "30": "And afterward came out his brother that had the red thread about his hand, which was called Zarah."
