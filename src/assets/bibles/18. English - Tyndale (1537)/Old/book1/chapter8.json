  "1": "And God remembered Noe and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; And God made a wind to blow upon the earth, and the waters ceased:",
  "2": "and the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain of heaven was forbidden,",
  "3": "and the waters returned from off the earth and abated after the end of an hundred and fifty days.",
  "4": "And the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat, the seventeenth day of the seventh month.",
  "5": "And the waters went away and decreased until the tenth month. And the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains appeared.",
  "6": "And after the end of forty days, Noe opened the window of the ark which he had made,",
  "7": "and sent forth a raven, which went out, ever going and coming again, until the waters were dried up upon the earth.",
  "8": "Then sent he forth a dove from him, to wete whether the waters were fallen from off the earth.",
  "9": "And when the dove could find no resting place for her foot, she returned to him again unto the ark, for the waters were upon the face of all the earth. And he put out his hand and took her and pulled her to him into the ark.",
  "10": "And he abode yet seven days more,(mo) and sent out the dove again out of the ark,",
  "11": "and the dove came to him again about eventide, and behold: there was in her mouth a leaf of an olive tree which she had plucked, whereby Noe perceived that the waters were abated upon the earth.",
  "12": "And he tarried yet seven other days, and sent forth the dove, which from thence forth came no more again to him.",
  "13": "And it came to pass, the six hundred and one year and the first day of the first month, that the waters were dried up upon the earth. And Noe took off the hatches of the ark and looked: and behold, the face of the earth was dry.",
  "14": "So by the twenty seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.",
  "15": "And God spake unto Noe saying:",
  "16": "Come out of the ark, both thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons' wives with thee.",
  "17": "And all the beasts that are with thee whatsoever flesh it be, both fowl and cattle and all manner worms that creep on the earth, bring out with thee, and let them move, grow and multiply upon the earth.",
  "18": "And Noe came out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.",
  "19": "And all the beasts, and all the worms, and all the fowls, and all that moved upon the earth, came also out of the ark, all of one kind together.",
  "20": "And Noe made an altar unto the LORD,(LORDE) and took of all manner of clean beasts and all manner of clean fowls, and offered sacrifice upon the altar.",
  "21": "And the LORD(LORDE) smelled a sweet savour and said in his heart: I will henceforth no more curse the earth for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil even from the very youth of him. Moreover I will not destroy from henceforth all that liveth as I have done.",
  "22": "Neither shall sowing time and harvest, cold, and heat, summer and winter, day and night cease, as long as the earth endureth."
