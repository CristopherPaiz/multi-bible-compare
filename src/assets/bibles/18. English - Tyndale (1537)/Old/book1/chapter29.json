  "1": "Then Jacob lift up his feet, and went toward the east country.",
  "2": "And as he looked about, behold there was a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lay thereby (for at that well were the flocks watered) and there lay a great stone at the well mouth.",
  "3": "And the manner was to bring the flocks thither, and to roll the stone from the well's mouth and to water the sheep, and to put the stone again upon the well's mouth unto his place.",
  "4": "And Jacob said unto them: brethren, whence be ye? And they said: of Haran are we.",
  "5": "And he said unto them: Know ye Laban the son of Nahor. And they said: We know him.",
  "6": "And he said unto them: is he in good health? And they said: he is in good health: and behold, his daughter Rahel cometh with the sheep.",
  "7": "And he said: lo, it is yet a great while to night, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water the sheep and go and feed them.",
  "8": "And they said: we may not, until all the flocks be brought together, and the stone be rolled from the well's mouth, and so we water our sheep.",
  "9": "While he yet talked with them, Rahel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.",
  "10": "As soon as Jacob saw Rahel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, he went and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.",
  "11": "And Jacob kissed Rahel, and lift up his voice and wept:",
  "12": "and told her also that he was her father's brother and Rebecca's son. Then Rahel ran and told her father.",
  "13": "When Laban heard tell of Jacob his sister's son, he ran against him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him into his house. And then Jacob told Laban all the matter.",
  "14": "And then Laban said: well, thou art my bone and my flesh. Abide with me the space of a month.",
  "15": "And afterward Laban said unto Jacob: though thou be my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me what shall thy wages be?",
  "16": "And Laban had two daughters, the eldest called Lea and the youngest Rahel.",
  "17": "Lea was tender eyed, but Rahel was beautiful and well favored.",
  "18": "And Jacob loved her well, and said: I will serve thee seven year for Rahel thy youngest daughter.",
  "19": "And Laban answered: it is better that I give her thee, than to another man: bide therefore with me.",
  "20": "And Jacob served seven years for Rahel, and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.",
  "21": "And Jacob said unto Laban: give me my wife, that I may lie with her. For the time appointed me is come.",
  "22": "Then Laban bade all the men of that place, and made a feast.",
  "23": "And when even was come, he took Lea his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her.",
  "24": "And Laban gave unto his daughter Lea, Zilpha his maid, to be her servant.",
  "25": "And when the morning was come, behold it was Lea. Than said he to Laban: wherefore hast thou played thus with me? did not I serve thee for Rahel, wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?",
  "26": "Laban answered: it is not the manner of this place, to marry the youngest before the eldest.",
  "27": "Pass out this week, and then shall this also be given thee for the service which thou shalt serve me yet seven years more.",
  "28": "And Jacob did even so, and passed out that week, and then he gave him Rahel his daughter to wife also.",
  "29": "And Laban gave to Rahel his daughter, Bilha his handmaid to be her servant.",
  "30": "So lay he by Rahel also, and loved Rahel more than Lea, and served him yet seven years more.",
  "31": "When the LORD saw that Lea was despised, he made her fruitful: but Rahel was barren.",
  "32": "And Lea conceived and bare a son, and called his name Ruben, for she said: the LORD hath looked upon my tribulation. And now my husband will love me.",
  "33": "And she conceived again and bare a son, and said: the LORD hath heard that I am despised, and hath therefore given me this son also, and she called him Simeon.",
  "34": "And she conceived yet and bare a son, and said: now this once will my husband keep me company, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.",
  "35": "And she conceived yet again, and bare a son saying: Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Juda, and left bearing."
