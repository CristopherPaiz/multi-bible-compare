  "4": "I am, behold my testament is with thee, that thou shalt be a father of many nations.",
  "5": "Therefore shalt thou no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham: for a father of many nations have I made thee,",
  "6": "and I will multiply thee exceedingly, and will make nations of thee: yea and kings shall spring out of thee.",
  "7": "Moreover I will make my bond between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their times to be an everlasting testament, so that I will be God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.",

  "11": "Ye shall circumcise the foreskin of your flesh, and it shall be a token of the bond betwixt me and you.",
  "12": "And every manchild when it is eight days old, shall be circumcised among you in your generations, and all servants also born at home or bought with money though they be strangers and not of thy seed.",
  "13": "The servant born in thy house, and he also that is bought with money, must needs be circumcised, that my testament may be in your flesh, for an everlasting bond.",

  "15": "And God said unto Abraham. Sarai thy wife shall no more be called Sarai: but Sara shall her name be.",

  "18": "And Abraham said unto God. O that Ismael might live in thy sight.",
  "19": "Then said God: nay, Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac. And I will make my bond with him, that it shall be an everlasting bond unto his seed after him.",
  "20": "And as concerning Ismael also, I have heard thy request: lo, I will bless him and increase him, and multiply him exceedingly. Twelve princes shall he(be) beget, and I will make a great nation of him.",
  "21": "But my bond will I make with Isaac, which Sara shall bear unto thee: even this time twelve month.",
  "22": "And God left off talking with him, and departed up from Abraham.",
  "23": "And Abraham took Ismael his son and all the servants born in his house and all that was bought with money as many as were men children among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the foreskin of their flesh, even the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.",
  "24": "Abraham was ninety year old and nine when he cut off the foreskin of his flesh.",
