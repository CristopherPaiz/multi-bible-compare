  "1": "And he commanded the ruler of his house saying: fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry,",
  "2": "and put every man's money in his bag mouth, and put my silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest and his corn money also. And he did as Joseph had said.",
  "3": "And in the morning as soon as it was light, the men were let go with their asses.",
  "4": "And when they were out of the city and not yet far away, Joseph said unto the ruler of his house: up and follow after the men and overtake them, and say unto them: wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?",
  "5": "is that not the cup of which my lord drinketh, and doth he not prophesy therein? ye have evil done that ye have done.",
  "6": "And he overtook them and said the same words unto them.",
  "7": "And they answered him: wherefore saith my lord such words? God forbid that thy servants should do so.",
  "8": "Behold, the money which we found in our sack's mouths, we brought again unto thee, out of the land of Canaa: how then should we steal out of my lord's house, either silver or gold?",
  "9": "with whosoever of thy servants it be found let him die, and let us also be my lord's bondmen.",
  "10": "And he said: Now therefore according unto your words, he with whom it is found, shall be my servant: but ye, shall be harmless.",
  "11": "And at once every man took down his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack.",
  "12": "And he searched, and began at the eldest and left at the youngest. And the cup was found in Ben Jamin's sack.",
  "13": "Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass and went again unto the city.",
  "14": "And Juda and his brethren came to Joseph's house, for he was yet there, and they fell before him on the ground.",
  "15": "And Joseph said unto them: what deed is this which ye have done? wist ye not that such a man as I can prophesy?",
  "16": "Then said Juda: what shall we say unto my lord, what shall we speak or what excuse can we make? God hath found out the wickedness of thy servants. Behold, both we and he with whom the cup is found, are thy servants.",
  "17": "And he answered: God forbid that I should do so, the man with whom the cup is found, he shall be my servant: but go ye in peace unto your father.",
  "18": "Then Juda went unto him and said: oh my lord, let thy servant speak a word in my lord's audience,(ear) and be not wroth with thy servant: for thou art even as Pharao.",
  "19": "My lord asked his servant saying: have ye a father or a brother?",
  "20": "And we answered my lord, we have a father that is old, and a young lad which he begat in his age: and the brother of the said lad is dead, and he is all that is left of that mother. And his father loveth him.",
  "21": "Then said my lord unto his servants bring him unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.",
  "22": "And we answered my lord, that the lad could not go from his father, for if he should leave his father, he were but a dead man.",
  "23": "Then saidest thou unto thy servants: except your youngest brother come with you, look that ye see my face no more.",
  "24": "And when we came unto thy servant our father, we shewed him what my lord had said.",
  "25": "And when our father said unto us, go again and buy us a little food:",
  "26": "we said, that we could not go. Nevertheless if our youngest brother go with us then will we go, for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.",
  "27": "Then said thy servant our father unto us. Ye know that my wife bare me two sons.",
  "28": "And the one went out from me and it is said of a surety that he is torn in pieces of wild beasts, and I saw him not since.",
  "29": "If ye shall take this also away from me and some misfortune happen upon him, then shall ye bring my gray head with sorrow unto the grave.",
  "30": "Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, if the lad be not with me: seeing that his life hangeth by the lad's life,",
  "31": "then as soon as he seeth that the lad is not come, he will die. So shall we thy servants bring the gray head of thy servant our father with sorrow unto the grave.",
  "32": "For I thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father and said: if I bring him not unto thee again. I will bear the blame all my life long.",
  "33": "Now therefore let me thy servant bide here for the lad, and be my lord's bondman: and let the lad go home with his brethren.",
  "34": "For how can I go unto my father, and the lad not with me: lest I should see the wretchedness that shall come on my father."
