  "1": "And it chanced after this, that the chief butler of the king of Egypt and his chief baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.",
  "2": "And Pharao was angry with them and put them in ward in his chief marshal's house:",
  "3": "even in the prison where Joseph was bound.",
  "4": "And the chief marshal gave Joseph a charge with them, and he served them. And they continued a season in ward.",
  "5": "And they dreamed either of them in one night: both the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were bound in the prison house, either of them his dream, and each man's dream of a sundry interpretation.",
  "6": "When Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them: behold, they were sad.",
  "7": "And he asked them saying, wherefore look ye so sadly today?",
  "8": "They answered him, we have dreamed a dream, and have no man to declare it. And Joseph said unto them. Interpreting belongeth to God, but tell me yet.",
  "9": "And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said unto him: In my dream me thought there stood a vine before me,",
  "10": "and in the vine were three branches, and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth: and the grapes thereof waxed ripe.",
  "11": "And I had Pharao's cup in my hand, and took of the grapes and wrung them into Pharao's cup, and delivered Pharao's cup into his hand.",
  "12": "And Joseph said unto him, this is the interpretation of it.",
  "13": "The three branches are three days: for within three days shall Pharao lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thine office again, and thou shalt deliver Pharao's cup into his hand, after the old manner, even as thou didst when thou wast his butler.",
  "14": "But think on me with thee, when thou art in good case, and shew mercy unto me. And make mention of me to Pharao, and help to bring me out of this house:",
  "15": "for I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing at all wherefore they should have put me into this dungeon.",
  "16": "When the chief baker saw that he had well interpreted it, he said unto Joseph, me thought also in my dream, that I had three wicker baskets on my head?",
  "17": "And in the uppermost basket, of all manner bakemeats for Pharao. And the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.",
  "18": "Joseph answered and said: this is the interpretation thereof. The three baskets are three days,",
  "19": "for this day three days shall Pharao take thy head from thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.",
  "20": "And it came to pass the third day which was Pharao's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.",
  "21": "And restored the chief butler unto his butlership again, and he reached the cup into Pharao's hand,",
  "22": "and hanged the chief baker: even as Joseph had interpreted unto them.",
  "23": "Notwithstanding the chief butler remembered not Joseph, but forgot him."
