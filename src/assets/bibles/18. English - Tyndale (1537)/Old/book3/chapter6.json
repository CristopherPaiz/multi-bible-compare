  "11": "and then put off his raiment and put on other and carry the ashes out without the host unto a clean place.",
  "12": "The fire that is upon the altar shall burn therein and not go out. And the priest shall put wood on the fire every morning, and put the burntsacrifice upon it, and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peaceofferings.",

  "17": "Their part which I have given them of my sacrifice, shall not be baken with leaven, for it is most holy, as is the sinoffering, and trespass offering.",
  "18": "All the males among the children of Aaron, shall eat of it: and it shall be a duty for ever unto your generations of the sacrifices of the LORD, neither shall any man twitch it, but he that is hallowed.",
  "19": "And the LORD spake unto Moses saying:",
  "20": "this is the offering of Aaron and of his sons which he shall offer unto the LORD in the day when they are anointed: the tenth part of an Epha of flour, which is a daily meatoffering perpetually: half in the morning and half at night:",
  "21": "and in the frying pan it shall be made with oil. And when it is fried, thou shalt bring it in as a baken meatoffering minced small, and shalt offer it for a sweet savour unto the LORD.",
  "22": "And that priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead, shall offer it: and it shall be the LORD's(lordes) duty for ever, and it shall be burnt altogether.",

  "26": "The priest that offereth it shall eat it in the holy place: even in the court of the tabernacle of witness.",
  "27": "No man shall touch the flesh thereof, save he that is hallowed. And if any raiment be sprinkled therewith, it shall be washed in an holy place,",
  "28": "and the earthen pot that it is sodden in shall be broken. If it be sodden in brass, then the pot shall be scoured and plunged(rinsed) in the water.",
  "29": "All the males among the children of Aaron(the priests) shall eat thereof, for it is most holy.",
  "30": "Notwithstanding no sinoffering that hath his blood brought into the tabernacle of witness to reconcile with all in the holy place, shall be eaten: but shall be burnt in the fire."
