  "1": "And the LORD spake unto Moses saying:",
  "2": "take Aaron and his sons with him, and the vestures and the anointing oil, and an ox for a sinoffering and two rams and a basket of sweet bread:",
  "3": "and gather all the community together unto the door of the tabernacle of witness.",
  "4": "And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the people gathered them selves together unto the door of the tabernacle of witness.",
  "5": "And Moses said unto the people: this is the thing which the LORD commanded to do.",
  "6": "And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water,",
  "7": "and put upon him the alb and gird him with a girdle, and put upon him the tunicle, and put the Ephod thereon, and girded him with the broidered girdle of the Ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.",
  "8": "And he put the breastlap thereon, and put in the breastlap light and perfectness.",
  "9": "And he put the mitre upon his head, and put upon the mitre even upon the forefront of it, the golden plate of the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "10": "And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the habitation and all that was therein and sanctified them,",
  "11": "and sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, and the laver with his foot, to sanctify them.",
  "12": "And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him to sanctify him.",
  "13": "And he brought Aaron's sons and put albs upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon their heads: as the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "14": "And the sinoffering was brought. And Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head of the ox of the sinoffering.",
  "15": "And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified it, and poured the blood unto the bottom of the altar and sanctified it and reconciled it.",
  "16": "And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul that was on the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and burned it upon the altar.",
  "17": "But the ox, the hide, his flesh and his dung, he burnt with fire without the host, as the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "18": "And he brought the ram of the burntoffering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head of the ram,",
  "19": "and it was killed. And Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about,",
  "20": "and cut the ram in pieces and burnt the head, the pieces and the fat,",
  "21": "and washed the inwards and the legs in water, and burn the ram every whit upon the altar. That was a burnt sacrifice of a sweet savour, and an offering unto the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "22": "And he brought the other ram that was the fulloffering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head of the ram:",
  "23": "And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.",
  "24": "Then were Aaron's sons brought, and Moses put of the blood on the tip of the right ear of them, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.",
  "25": "And he took the fat and the rump and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat and their right shoulder.",
  "26": "And out of the basket of sweet bread that was before the LORD, he took one sweet cake of oiled bread and one wafer, and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder,",
  "27": "and put altogether upon Aaron's hands and upon his sons' hands, and waved it a waveoffering before the LORD.",
  "28": "And then Moses took them from of their hands again, and burnt them upon the altar, even upon the burntoffering: These are the fullofferings of a sweet savour and a sacrifice unto the LORD.",
  "29": "And Moses took the breast and waved it a waveoffering before the LORD, of the ram of the fullofferings: and it was Moses' part, as the LORD commanded Moses.",
  "30": "And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his vestments and upon his sons and on their vestments with him, and sanctified Aaron and his vestures and his sons and his sons' vestures also.",
  "31": "Then Moses said unto Aaron and his sons: boil the flesh in the door of the tabernacle of witness, and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of fullofferings, as the Lord commanded saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it:",
  "32": "and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread, burn with fire.",
  "33": "And see that ye depart not from the door of the tabernacle of witness seven days long: until the days of your fullofferings be at an end. For seven days must your hands be filled,",
  "34": "as they were this day: even so the LORD hath commanded to do, to reconcile you with all.",
  "35": "See therefore that ye abide in the door of the tabernacle of witness day and night seven days long: and keep the watch of the LORD that ye die not: for so I am commanded.",
  "36": "And Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses."
