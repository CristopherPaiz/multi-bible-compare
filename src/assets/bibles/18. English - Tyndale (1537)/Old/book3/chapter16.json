  "1": "And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had offered before the LORD and died:",
  "2": "And he said unto Moses: speak unto Aaron thy brother that he go not at all times into the holy place, that is whithin the vail that hangeth before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not. For I will appear in a cloud upon the mercy seat.",
  "3": "But of this manner shall Aaron go in into the holy place: with a young ox(bullock) for a sinoffering, and a ram for a burntoffering.",
  "4": "And he shall put the holy linen alb upon him, and shall have a linen breech upon his flesh, and shall gird him with a linen girdle, and put the linen mitre upon his head: for they are holy raiments. And he shall wash his flesh with water, and put them on.",
  "5": "And he shall take of the multitude of the children of Israel two goats for a sinoffering and a ram for a burntoffering.",
  "6": "And Aaron shall offer the ox for his sinoffering and make an atonement for him and for his house.",
  "7": "And he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD in the door of the tabernacle of witness.",
  "8": "And Aaron cast lots over the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and another for a scapegoat.",
  "9": "And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sinoffering.",
  "10": "But the goat on which the lot fell to scape, he shall set alive before the LORD to reconcile with and to let him go free into the wilderness.",
  "11": "And Aaron shall bring the ox of his sinoffering, and reconcile for himself and for his household, and kill him.",
  "12": "And then he shall take a censer full of burning coals out of the altar that is before the LORD, and his handful of sweet cense beaten small, and bring them within the vail",
  "13": "and put the cense upon the fire before the LORD: that the cloud of the cense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the witness, that he die not.",
  "14": "And he shall take of the blood of the ox and sprinkle it with his finger before the mercy seat eastward: even seven times.",
  "15": "Then shall he kill the goat that is the people's sinoffering, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the ox, and let him sprinkle it toward the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:",
  "16": "and reconcile the holy place from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their trespasses and all their sins. And so let him do also unto the tabernacle of witness that dwelleth with them, even among their uncleannesses.",
  "17": "And there shall be nobody in the tabernacle of witness, when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out again. And he shall make an atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the multitude of Israel.",
  "18": "Then he shall go out unto the altar that standeth before the LORD, and reconcile it, and shall take of the blood of the ox and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about,",
  "19": "and sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.",
  "20": "And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and the tabernacle of witness and the altar, let him bring the live goat",
  "21": "and let Aaron put both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the misdeeds of the children of Israel, and all their trespasses, and all their sins: and let him put them upon the head of the goat and send him away by the hands of one that is acquainted in the wilderness.",
  "22": "And the goat shall bear upon him all their misdeeds unto the wilderness, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.",
  "23": "And let Aaron go in to the tabernacle of witness and put off the line clothes which he put on when he went in into the holy place, and leave them there.",
  "24": "And let him wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his own raiment, and then come out and offer his burntoffering and the burntoffering of the people, and make an atonement for himself and for the people,",
  "25": "and the fat of the sinoffering let him burn upon the altar.",
  "26": "And let him that carried forth the scapegoat, wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and then come into the host again.",
  "27": "And the ox of the sinoffering and the goat of the sinoffering (whose blood was brought in to make an atonement in the holy place) let one carry out without the host and burn with fire: both their skins, their flesh and their dung.",
  "28": "And let him that burneth them, wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and then come into the host again.",
  "29": "And it(this) shall be an ordinance for ever unto you. And even in the tenth day of the seventh month, ye shall humble your souls and shall do no work at all: whether it be one of your selves or a stranger that sojourneth among you,",
  "30": "for that day shall an atonement be made for you to cleanse you from all your sins before the LORD, and ye shall be clean.",
  "31": "It shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall humble your souls, and it shall be an ordinance for ever.",
  "32": "And the priest that is anointed and whose hand was filled to minister in his father's stead, shall make the atonement and shall put on the holy linen (clothes and holy) vestments,",
  "33": "and reconcile the holy sanctuary and the tabernacle of witness and the altar, and shall make an atonement also for the priests and for all the people of the congregation.",
  "34": "And this shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year: and it was done even as the LORD commanded Moses."
