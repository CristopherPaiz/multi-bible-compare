  "3": "And unto the children of Israel he spake saying: take ye an he goat for a sinoffering, and a calf and a lamb both two of a year old, and without blemish for a burnt sacrifice,",
  "4": "and an ox and a ram for peaceofferings, to offer before the LORD, and a meatoffering mingled with oil, for today the LORD will appear unto you.",
  "5": "And they brought that which Moses commanded unto the tabernacle of witness, and all the people came and stood before the LORD.",

  "7": "And Moses said unto Aaron: go unto the altar and offer thy sinoffering, and make an atonement for thee and for the people: and then offer the offering of the people and reconcile them also, as the LORD commanded Moses.",

  "10": "And the fat and the two kidneys with the caul of the liver of the sinoffering, he burnt upon the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses:",
  "11": "but the flesh and the hide, he burnt with fire without the host.",
  "12": "Afterward he slew the burntoffering, and Aaron's sons brought the blood unto him, and he sprinkled it round about upon the altar.",

  "14": "and did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them also upon the burntoffering in the altar.",
  "15": "And then he brought the people's offering and took the goat that was the people's sinoffering, and slew it and offered it for a sinoffering: as he did the first.",
  "16": "And then brought the burntoffering and offered it as the manner was,",
  "17": "and brought the meatoffering and filled his hand thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice in the morning.",

  "22": "And Aaron lift up his hand over the people and blessed them, and came down from offering of sinofferings, burntofferings and peaceofferings.",
  "23": "Then Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of witness and came out again and blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.",
  "24": "And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar: the burntoffering and the fat. And all the people saw it and shouted, and fell on their faces."
