  "1": "And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:",
  "2": "when there appeareth a rising in any man's flesh either a scab or a glistering white: as though the plague of leprosy were in the skin of his flesh, then let him be brought unto Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priests,",
  "3": "and let the priest look on the sore that is in the skin of his flesh. If the hair in the sore be turned unto white, and the sore also seem to be lower than the skin of his flesh, then it is surely a leprosy, and let the priest look on him and make him unclean.",
  "4": "If there be but a white pleck in the skin of his flesh, and seem not to be lower than the other skin nor the hair thereof is turned unto white: then let the priest shut him up seven days.",
  "5": "And let the priest look upon him the seventh day: if the sore seem to him to abide still and to go no further in the skin, then let the priest shut him up yet seven days more.",
  "6": "And let the priest look on him again the seventh day. Then if the sore be waxed blackish, and is not grown abroad in the skin, let the priest make him clean, for it is but a scurf. And let him wash his clothes, and then he is clean.",
  "7": "But and if the scab grow in the skin after that he is seen of the priest again.",
  "8": "If the priest see that the scab be grown abroad in the skin, let him make him unclean: for it is surely a leprosy.",
  "9": "If the plague of leprosy be in a man, let him be brought unto the priest,",
  "10": "and let the priest see him. If the rising appear white in the skin, and have also made the hair white, and there be raw flesh in the sore also:",
  "11": "then it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh. And the priest shall make him unclean, and shall not shut him up for he is unclean.",
  "12": "If a leprosy break out in the skin and cover all the skin from the head to the foot over all wheresoever the priest looketh,",
  "13": "then let the priest look upon him. If the leprosy have covered all his flesh, let him make(judge) the disease clean: for inasmuch as he is altogether white he is therefore clean.",
  "14": "But and if there be raw flesh on him when he is seen, then he shall be unclean.",
  "15": "Therefore when the priest seeth the raw flesh, let him make him unclean. For inasmuch as his flesh is raw, he is unclean and it is surely a true leprosy.",
  "16": "But and if the raw flesh depart again and change unto white, then let him come to the priest",
  "17": "and let the priest see him: If the sore be changed unto white, let the priest make(judge) the disease clean, and then he is clean.",
  "18": "When there is a beal in the skin of any man's flesh and is healed",
  "19": "and after in the place of the beal there appear a white rising either a shining white somewhat reddish, let him be seen of the priest.",
  "20": "If when the priest seeth him it appear lower than the other skin and the hair thereof be changed unto white, let the priest make(judge) him unclean: for it is a very leprosy, that is broken out in the place of the beal.",
  "21": "But and if when the priest looketh on it there be no white hairs therein neither the scab lower than the other skin and be somewhat blackish, then the priest shall shut him apart seven days.",
  "22": "If it spread abroad in the mean season, then let the priest make(judge) him unclean: for it is a leprosy.",
  "23": "But and if the glistering white abide still in one place and go no further, then it is but the print of the beal, and the priest shall make(judge) him clean.",
  "24": "When the skin of any man's flesh is burnt with fire that it be raw and there appear in the burning a glistering white that is somewhat reddish or altogether white,",
  "25": "let the priest look upon it. If the hair in that brightness be changed to white and it also appear lower than the other skin, then it is a leprosy that is broken out in the place of the burning. And the priest shall make(judge) him unclean, for it is a leprosy.",
  "26": "But and if (when the priest looketh on it) he see that there is no white hair in the brightness, and that it is no lower than the other skin, and that it is also blackish, then let the priest shut him up seven days.",
  "27": "And if (when the priest looketh on him the seventh day) it be grown abroad in the skin, let him make(judge) him unclean: for it is a leprosy.",
  "28": "But and if that brightness abide still in one place and go no further in the skin and be blackish, then it is but a rising in the place of the burning, and the priest shall make him clean: for it is but the print of the burning only.",
  "29": "When either man or woman hath a breaking out upon the head or the beard, let the priest see it.",
  "30": "And if it appear lower than the other skin, and there be therein golden hairs and thin, let the priest make(judge) him unclean, for it is a breaking out of leprosy upon the head or beard.",
  "31": "If (when the priest looketh on the breaking out) he see that it is no lower than the other skin and that there are black hairs therein, let him shut him up seven days.",
  "32": "And let the priest look on the disease the seventh day: and if the breaking out be gone no further neither be any golden hairs therein neither the scab be lower than the other skin,",
  "33": "then let him be shaven, but let him not shave the scab, and let the priest shut him up seven days more.",
  "34": "And let the priest look on the breaking out the seventh day again: If the breaking out be gone no further in the skin nor more lower than the other skin, then let the priest make(judge) him clean, and let him wash his clothes and then he is clean.",
  "35": "If the breaking out grow in the skin after that he is once made(judged) clean,",
  "36": "let the priest see him. If it be grown abroad indeed in the skin, let the priest seek no further for any golden hairs, for he is unclean.",
  "37": "But and if he see that the scab stand still, and that there is black hair grown up therein, then the scab is healed and he is clean: and the priest shall make(judge) him clean.",
  "38": "If there be found in the skin of the flesh of man or woman a glistering white,",
  "39": "let the priest see it. If there appear in their flesh a glistering white somewhat blackish, then it is but freckles grown up in the skin: and he is clean.",
  "40": "If a man's hair fall off his head, then he is headbald and clean.",
  "41": "If his hair fall before in his forehead, then he is foreheadbald and clean.",
  "42": "If there be in the bald head or bald forehead a reddish white scab, then there is leprosy sprung up in his bald head or bald forehead.",
  "43": "And let the priest see it: and if the rising of the sore be reddish white in his bald head or forehead after the manner of a leprosy in the skin of the flesh,",
  "44": "then he is a leper and unclean: and the priest shall make(judge) him unclean, for the plague of his head.",
  "45": "And the leper in whom the plague is, shall have his clothes rent and his head bare and his mouth muffled and shall be called unclean.",
  "46": "And as long as the disease lasteth upon him, he shall be unclean: for he is unclean, and shall therefore dwell alone, and even without the host shall his habitation be.",
  "47": "When the plague of leprosy is in a cloth: whether it be linen or woollen,",
  "48": "yea and whether it be in the warp or woof of the linen or of the woollen: either in a skin or any thing made of skin,",
  "49": "if the disease be pale or somewhat reddish in the cloth or skin: whether it be in the warp or the woof or any thing that is made of skin, then it is a very leprosy, and must be shewed unto the priest.",
  "50": "And when the priest seeth the plague, let him shut it up seven days,",
  "51": "and let him look on the plague the seventh day. If it be increased in the cloth: whether it be in the warp or woof or in a skin or in anything that is made of skin, then the plague is a fretting leprosy, and it is unclean:",
  "52": "And that cloth shall be burnt, either warp or woof, whether it be woollen or linen or any thing that is made of skin wherein the plague is, for it is a fretting leprosy, and shall be burnt in the fire.",
  "53": "If the priest see that the plague hath fretten no further in the cloth: either in the warp or woof or in whatsoever thing of skin it be,",
  "54": "then let the priest command then to wash the thing wherein the plague is, and let him shut it up seven days more.",
  "55": "And let the priest look on it again after that the plague is washed. If the plague have not changed his fashion though it be spread no further abroad, it is yet unclean. And see that ye burn it in the fire, for it is fretten inward: whether in part or in all together.",
  "56": "But and if the priest see that it is somewhat blackish after that it is washed, let him rent it out of the cloth, or out of the skin or out of the warp or woof.",
  "57": "But and if it appear any more in the cloth either in the warp or in the woof or in anything made of skin, then it is a waxing plague. And see that ye burn that with fire, wherein the plague is.",
  "58": "Moreover the cloth either warp or woof or whatsoever thing of skin it be which thou hast washed and the plague be departed from it, shall be washed once again: and then it is clean.",
  "59": "This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a cloth whether it be woollen or linen: either whether it be in the warp or woof, or in anything made of skins, to make(judge) it clean or unclean."
