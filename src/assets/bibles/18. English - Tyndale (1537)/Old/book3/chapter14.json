  "43": "If now the plague come again and break out in the house, after that they have taken away the stones and scraped the house, and after that the house is plastered anew:",
  "44": "let the priest come and see it. And if then he perceive that the plague hath eaten further in the house, then it is a fretting leprosy that is in the house, and it is unclean.",
  "45": "Then they shall break down the house: both stones, timber and all the mortar of the house, and carry it out of the city unto a foul place.",
  "46": "Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up, shall be unclean until night.",
  "47": "And he that sleepeth in the house shall wash his clothes, and he also that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.",
  "48": "But and if the priest come and see that the plague hath spread no further in the house after that it is new plastered, then let him make it clean for the plague is healed.",
