  "1": "O that I might find thee without, and kiss thee, whom I love as my brother which sucked(suckte) my mother's breasts: and that thou wouldest not be offended,",
  "2": "if I took thee, and brought thee in to my mother's house: that thou mightest teach me, and that I might give thee drink of spiced wine and of the sweet sap of my pomegranates.",
  "3": "His left hand lieth under my head, and his right hand embraceth me.",
  "4": "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, that ye wake not up my love, nor touch her, till she be content herself.",
  "5": "What is she this, that cometh up from the wilderness, and leaneth upon her love? I am the same that waked thee up among the apple trees, where thy mother bear thee, where thy mother brought thee in to the world.",
