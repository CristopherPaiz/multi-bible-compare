  "1": "The Ballet of Ballets of Salomon:",
  "2": "O that thy mouth would give me a kiss, for thy breasts are more pleasant than wine,",
  "3": "and that because of the good and pleasant savour. Thy name is sweet smelling ointment, therefore do the maidens love thee:",
  "4": "Yea that same moveth me also to run(renne) after thee. The king hath brought me in to his private chamber. We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we think more of thy breasts than of wine: well is them that love thee.",
  "5": "I am black (O ye daughters of Jerusalem) like as the tents of the Cedarenes, and as the hangings of Solomon:",
  "6": "but yet am I fair and well favoured withal. Marvel not at me that I am so black: And why? the sun hath shined upon me. For when my mother's children had evil will at me, they made me the keeper of the vineyard. Thus was I fain to keep a vineyard, which was not mine own.",
  "7": "Tell me, (O thou whom my soul loveth) where thou feedest, where thou restest at the noon day: lest I go wrong, and come into the flocks of thy companions.",
  "8": "If thou know not thyself (O thou fairest among women) then go thy way forth after the footsteps of the sheep, as though thou wouldest feed thy goats beside the shepherds' tents.",
  "9": "There will I tarry for thee (my love) with mine host and with my chariots, which shall be no fewer than Pharaoh's.",
  "10": "Then shall thy cheeks and thy neck be made fair, and hanged with spangles and goodly jewels:",
  "11": "a neck band of gold will we make thee with silver buttons.",
  "12": "When the king sitteth at the table, he shall smell my Nardus:",
  "13": "for a bundle of Myrre (O my beloved) lieth betwixt my breasts.",
  "14": "A cluster of grapes of Cypers, or of the vineyards of Engaddi art thou unto me, O my beloved.",
  "15": "O how fair art thou (my love) how fair art thou? thou hast doves' eyes.",
  "16": "O how fair art thou (my beloved) how well favored art thou? Our bed is decked with flowers,",
  "17": "the ceilings of our house are of Cedar tree, and our balks of Cypress."
