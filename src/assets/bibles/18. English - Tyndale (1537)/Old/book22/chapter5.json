  "1": "Come into my garden O my sister, my Spouse: I have gathered my Myrre with my spice. I will eat my honey and my honeycomb, I will drink my wine and my milk. Eat, O ye friends, drink and be merry, O ye beloved.",
  "2": "As I was asleep, and my heart waking, I heard the voice of my beloved, when he knocked. Open to me (said he) O my sister, my love, my dove, my dearling: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of my hair are full of the night drops.",
  "3": "I have put off my coat: how can I do it on again? I have washed my feet, how shall I file them again?",
  "4": "But when my love put in his hand at the hole, my heart was moved toward him:",
  "5": "so that I stood up to open unto my beloved. My hands dropped with Myrre, and the Myrre ran down my fingers upon the lock.",
  "6": "Nevertheless when I had opened unto my beloved, he was departed and gone his way. Now like as afore time when he spake, my heart could not longer refrain: Even so now I sought him, but I could not find him: I cried upon him, nevertheless he gave me no answer.",
  "7": "So the watchmen that went about the city found me, smote me, and wounded me: Yea they that kept the walls, took away my garment from me.",
  "8": "I charge you therefore, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him how that I am sick for love.",
  "9": "Who is thy love above other lovers, O thou fairest among women? Or what can thy love do, more than other lovers, that thou chargest us so straightly?",
  "10": "As for my loved, he is white and red colored, a singular person among many thousands:",
  "11": "His head is the most fine gold, the locks of his hair are bushed, brown as the evening:",
  "12": "His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water brooks, washened with milk, and remaining in a plenteous place:",
  "13": "His cheeks are like a garden bed, wherein the Apothecaries plant all manner of sweet things: His lips drop as the flowers of the most principal Myrre,",
  "14": "his hands are full of gold rings and precious stones. His body is as the pure ivory, decked over with Sapphires:",
  "15": "His legs are as the pillars of Marble, set upon sockets of gold: His face is as Libanus, and as the beauty of the Cedar trees:",
  "16": "His throat is sweet, yea he is altogether lovely. Such one is my love, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, such one is my love."
