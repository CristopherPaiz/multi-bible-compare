  "1": "And when king Arad the Cananite which dwelt in the south parts, heard tell that Israel came by the way that the spies had found out: he came and fought with Israel and took some of them prisoners.",
  "2": "Then Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD and said: If thou wilt give this people into our hands, we will destroy their cities.",
  "3": "And the LORD heard the voice of Israel, and delivered them the Cananites. And they destroyed both them and their cities, and called the place Horma.",
  "4": "Then they departed from mount Hor toward the red sea: to compass the land of Edom. And the souls of the people fainted by the way.",
  "5": "And the people spake against God and against Moses: wherefore hast thou brought us out of Egypt, for to die in the wilderness, for here is neither bread nor water, and our souls loatheth this light bread.",
  "6": "Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, which stung them: so that much people died in Israel.",
  "7": "And the people came to Moses and said: we have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against thee: make intercession to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses made intercession for the people.",
  "8": "And the LORD said unto Moses: make thee a serpent and hang it up for a sign, and let as many as are bitten look upon it and they shall live.",
  "9": "And Moses made a serpent of brass and set it up for a sign. And when the serpents had bitten any man, he went and beheld the serpent of brass and recovered.",
  "10": "And the children of Israel removed and pitched in Oboth.",
  "11": "And they departed from Oboth and lay at Egebarim in the wilderness which is before Moab on the east side.",
  "12": "And they removed thence, and pitched upon the river of Zarad.",
  "13": "And they departed thence and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which river is in the wilderness, and cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.",
  "14": "Wherefore it is spoken in the book of the war of the LORD: go with a violence, both on the river of Arnon",
  "15": "and on the river's head, which shooteth down to dwell at Ar, and leaneth upon the coasts of Moab.",
  "16": "And from thence they came to Bear, which is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses: gather the people together, that I may give them water.",
  "17": "Then Israel sang this song: Arise up well, sing thereto:",
  "18": "The well which the rulers digged and the captains of the people with the help of the lawgiver and with their staves. And from this wilderness they went to Matana,",
  "19": "and from Matana to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,",
  "20": "and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab in the top of Phasgah which boweth toward the wilderness.(Iesimon)",
  "21": "And Israel sent messengers unto Sehon, king of the Amorites, saying:",
  "22": "let us go thorow thy land: We will not turn into thy fields nor into thy vineyards, neither drink of the water of the wells: but we will go along by the common way, until we be past thy country.",
  "23": "And Sehon would give Israel no licence to pass thorow his country, but gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness. And he came to Jaheza and fought with Israel.",
  "24": "And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and conquered his land, from Arnon unto Jabock: even unto the children of Ammon. For the borders of the children of Ammon, are strong.",
  "25": "And Israel took all these cities and dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites: in Hesbon and in all the towns that long thereto.",
  "26": "For Hesbon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorites which Sehon had fought before with the king of the Moabites, and had taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.",
  "27": "Wherefore it is a proverb: go to Hesbon and let the city of Sehon be built and made ready",
  "28": "for there is a fire gone out of Hesbon and a flame from the city of Sehon and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites and the men of the hills of Arnon.",
  "29": "Woe be to thee Moab: O people of Chamos ye are forloren.(undone) His sons are put to flight and his daughters brought captive unto Sehon king of the Amorites.",
  "30": "Their light is out from Hesbon unto Dibon and we made a wilderness even unto Nopha which reacheth unto Mediba.",
  "31": "And thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.",
  "32": "And Moses sent to search out Jaezer, and they took the towns belonging thereto and conquered the Amorites that were there.",
  "33": "And then they turned and went up toward Bason. And Og the king of Bason came out against them, both he and all his people, to war at Edrei.",
  "34": "And the LORD said unto Moses: fear him not, for I have delivered him into thy hands with all his people and his land. And thou shalt do with him as thou didst with Sehon the king of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.",
  "35": "And they smote him and his sons and all his people, until there was nothing left him. And they conquered his land."
