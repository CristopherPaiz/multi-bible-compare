  "27": "And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balam: and Balam was wroth and smote the ass with a staff.",
  "28": "And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balam: what have I done unto thee, that thou smitest me thus three times?",
  "29": "And Balam said unto the Ass: because thou hast mocked me? I would that I had a sword in mine hand, that I might now kill thee.",
  "30": "And the ass said unto Balam: am not I thine Ass which thou hast ridden upon since thou wast born unto this day? Was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, nay.",
  "31": "And the LORD(lorde) opened the eyes of Balam that he saw the angel of the LORD(Lorde) standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand. And he bowed himself and fell flat on his face.",
