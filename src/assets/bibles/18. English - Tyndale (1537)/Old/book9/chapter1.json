  "1": "There was a man of Ramathaim Zophim, of mount Ephraim named Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Thohu, the son of Zuph an Ephrathite:",
  "2": "which had two wives, the one called Hannah and the other Phenennah. And Phenennah had children, but Hannah had none.",
  "3": "And the said man went out of his city every feastful day, to pray and to offer unto the LORD of Hosts: where the two sons of Eli (Hophni and Phinehes) were the LORD's priests.",
  "4": "And it fell on a day as Elkanah had offered that he gave to Phenennah his wife and to all her sons and daughters portions.",
  "5": "But unto Hannah he gave a portion with a heavy cheer, for he loved her, nevertheless the LORD had made her barren.",
  "6": "And thereto her enemy Phenennah vexed her a good in casting her in the teeth how the LORD had made her barren.",
  "7": "And so did she year by year as oft as she went up to the house of the LORD. And so chafed her: wherefore Hannah wept and ate not.",
  "8": "Then said Elkanah her husband to her: Hannah why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thine heart so troubled? am not I better to thee, than ten sons",
  "9": "Then Hannah rose up after that they had eaten and drunk in Siloh. And Eli the priest sat upon a stool by one of the side posts of the temple of the LORD.",
  "10": "And she was troubled in her spirits, and prayed unto the LORD and wept sore,",
  "11": "and vowed a vow and said: LORD of Hosts, if thou wilt look on the wretchedness of thine handmaid and shalt remember me and not forget thine handmaid, and shalt give unto thine handmaid a man child I will give him unto the LORD, all the days of his life and there shall neither razor or shears come upon his head.",
  "12": "And as she continued praying before the LORD, Eli marked her mouth.",
  "13": "For Hannah she spake in her heart, and her lips did but move onely, but her voice was not heard. And therefore Eli took her for drunken,",
  "14": "and said unto her, how long wilt thou be drunken? put away from thee, the wine that thou hast.",
  "15": "Hannah answered and said: not so my lord, I am a woman sorrowful in mine heart, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.",
  "16": "Count not thine handmaid to be like a daughter of unthriftiness: for out of the abundance of my meditation and grief have I spoken hitherto.",
  "17": "Eli answered and said: go in peace, the God of Israel shall grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.",
  "18": "Then she said, let thine handmaid find grace(favour) in thy sight. And so the woman went her way, and did eat and looked no more so sad.",
  "19": "And they rose up early and bowed themselves before the LORD, and then returned and went to their house to Ramath. And Elkanah lay by his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.",
  "20": "And in process of time she conceived and bare a son and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the LORD.",
  "21": "And Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD, both the offerings due for the feast and also his vows:",
  "22": "but Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband: I will tarry until the lad be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD and there abide for ever.",
  "23": "And Elkanah her husband said to her: do what seemeth thee best: tarry until thou hast weaned him, only the LORD make good his saying. And so the woman abode and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.",
  "24": "And then she took him with her, when she had weaned him, with three bullocks and an Epha of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him into the house of the LORD in Siloh, how be it the child was yet young.",
  "25": "And they slew the bullocks and brought in the lad to Eli,",
  "26": "and then she said: Oh my lord: as truly as thy soul liveth my lord: I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD",
  "27": "and for this lad I prayed, and the LORD hath given me my desire which I asked of him:",
  "28": "and therefore I also lend him the LORD, as long as he may be lent the LORD. And so they prayed there unto the LORD."
