  "1": "Saul was as a child of a year old, when he began to reign. And when he had reigned two years over Israel,",
  "2": "he chose him three thousand men out of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Machmas and mount Bethel, and a thousand with Jonathas in Gabaah Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent, every man to his own house.",
  "3": "And Jonathas slew the Philistines in an hold they had in Gabaah, and it came to the Philistines' ears. And Saul caused the trumpet to be blown thorowout all the land saying: let the Hebrews hear.",
  "4": "And all Israel heard say, how that Saul had destroyed an hold of the Philistines, and how that Israel stank unto the Philistines. And all the people cried after Saul to Gilgal.",
  "5": "Then the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and Six thousand horsemen with other people like the sand by the sea's side in multitude and came up and pitched in Michmas eastward from Bethaven.",
  "6": "And when the men of Israel saw themselves in a strait, and that the people were acumbered, they hid themselves in caves, in privy holes, in rocks, dens and pits.",
  "7": "And the Hebrews went over Jordan unto the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was yet in Gilgal, and all the people that followed him were astonied.",
  "8": "And he tarried seven days, as Samuel had appointed. But Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people scattered from him.",
  "9": "Wherefore Saul said: bring burnt sacrifice to me and peace offerings. And he offered burnt sacrifice.",
  "10": "And as soon as he had made an end of offering burnt offerings behold, Samuel came. And Saul went against him, to Salute him. Then said Samuel to Saul: what hast thou done?",
  "11": "And Saul said, because I saw that the people scattered from me, and yet thou camest not within the days appointed and that the phlistines gathered themselves together to Machmas:",
  "12": "then said I, the Philistines shall come down upon me to Gilgal, before I have made supplication unto the LORD. And therefore I took a courage with me and offered burnt offerings.",
  "13": "Then said Samuel to Saul: thou hast done foolishly and hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which he commanded thee. For at this time would the LORD have stablished thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.",
  "14": "But now thy kingdom shall not continue. The LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and hath commanded him to be a captain over his people: because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.",
  "15": "And Samuel arose and gat him from Gilgal to Gabaah Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about a six hundredth men.",
  "16": "And Saul and Jonathas his son and the people that were found with them, had their abiding in Gabaah Benjamin. But the Philistines had pitched in Machmas.",
  "17": "And there came out of the host of the Philistines three companies, to destroy: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ephrah unto the land of Sual.",
  "18": "And another company turned the way to Bethoron. And the third company turned to the way of the coast that turneth to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.",
  "19": "But there was no smith thorowout the land of Israel. For the Philistines thought that then the Hebrews might make them swords or spears.",
  "20": "And therefore must all Israel go down to the Philistines, to mend every man his share, his mattock, his axe or his sickle:",
  "21": "as oft as the edges of the sickles, mattocks, dung forks, and axes were blunt, and also to mend their goods.",
  "22": "And so in time of battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hands of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathas: save for Saul and Jonathas his son was there somewhat found.",
  "23": "And the Garrison of the Philistines came out and stood on the other side before Machmas."
