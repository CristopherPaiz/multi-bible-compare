  "4": "Nevertheless the lords of the Philistines were wroth with him and said unto him: Make this fellow return, and let him go again to his place which thou hast appointed him. For he shall not go with us to to battle, lest he be an adversary to us in the battle. For wherewith could he better obtain the favour of his master, than upon the heads of our men.",

  "11": "And so David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, and to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezrahel."
