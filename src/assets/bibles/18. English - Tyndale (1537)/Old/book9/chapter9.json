  "1": "Now there was a man of Benjamin named Cis the son of Abiel, the son of Zeroz. the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a man that was a Jeminite, a man of might:",
  "2": "the same had a son called Saul, a goodly young man, so that among the children of Israel, there was none goodlier than he, and was thereto from the shoulders upward higher than all the other people.",
  "3": "And it chanced that the Asses of this Cis Saul's father were lost. Then said Cis to Saul his son: Take one of the lads with thee and up and go seek the Asses.",
  "4": "And they went thorow mount Ephraim and thorow the land of Salisa, and found them not. Then they went thorow the land of Salim, and there they were not. Then they went also thorow the land of Jemini, and they found them not.",
  "5": "Then when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the young man that was with him: come let us return, lest my father leave caring for the Asses, and take thought for us. And he answered him:",
  "6": "behold there is in this city a worshipful man of God, and all that he sayeth, cometh to pass. Now then let us go thither: peradventure he shall shew us what way we may go.",
  "7": "Then said Saul to his lad: if we go what shall we bring the man? For our bread is all spent out of our hampers and there is none other present to bring the man of God, what have we?",
  "8": "And the young man answered Saul again and said: I have found about me the fourth part of a Sicle, that will we give the man of God to tell us our way.",
  "9": "Before time in Israel when a man went to seek an answer of God, thus wise he spake, come and let us go to the Sear. For he that is now called a prophet, was in the old time called a Sear.",
  "10": "Then said Saul to his young man: well said of thee: come let us go. And so they went unto the city where the man of God was.",
  "11": "And as they were going up into the city, they met with damsels that came out to draw water, and said unto them: is there here a sear?",
  "12": "And the maidens answered them, yea: behold, he goeth before you. Make haste now, for he came this day to the city, for the people must offer this day in the hill.",
  "13": "When ye be come into the city, so shall you find him, yer he go up to the hill to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he must bless the offering. And then eat they that be bidden to the feast. Now therefore get you up for even now shall ye find him.",
  "14": "And they went up into the city. And when they were come into the midst of the city: behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the hill.",
  "15": "But the LORD had told Samuel a day before Saul came, saying:",
  "16": "tomorrow this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, him shalt thou anoint to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people and their cry is come unto me.",
  "17": "When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD answered him: see, this is the man whom I spake to thee of. This same shall reign over my people.",
  "18": "Then went Saul to Samuel in the middle of the gate, and said: tell me I pray thee, where about the sear's house is,",
  "19": "and Samuel answered Saul and said: I am the sear, go up before me unto the hill, for ye shall eat with me to day. And tomorrow I will let thee go early, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart,",
  "20": "and as for thine asses that were lost this day three days, care not for them, for they are found. And moreover whose shall the beautiful things of Israel be? belong they not unto thee, and unto all thy father's house?",
  "21": "But Saul answered and said: am not I the son of a Jeminite of the smallest tribe of Israel, and my kindred the least of all the kindreds of the tribe of Benjamin, wherefore then speakest thou so to me?",
  "22": "And Samuel took Saul and his lad and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden: which were upon a thirty persons.",
  "23": "Then said Samuel unto the cook: bring forth the portion which I gave thee, and of which I said keep it with thee.",
  "24": "And the cook took up the shoulder and brought it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: behold, that which is left: put it before thee and eat, for I kept it for thee of purpose, when I called the people. And so Saul did eat with Samuel that day.",
  "25": "And when they were come down from the hill unto the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house:",
  "26": "and they arose early. And about the spring of the day Samuel called Saul upon the top of the house saying: up that I may send thee away. And Saul arose. And they went out at the doors both of them, both he and Samuel.",
  "27": "And when they were come almost out of the town, Samuel said to Saul: bid the lad go before us, and he went, but stand thou still awhile even now, that I may shew thee what God sayeth."
