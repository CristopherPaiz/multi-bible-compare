  "5": "he sent out ten of his young men, and said unto them: get you up to Carmel and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.",

  "7": "I have heard say that thou hast shearers. Now the shepherds were with us, and we did them no spite, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel:",
  "8": "ask thy lads, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let these young men find favour in thine eyes (for we come in a good season) and give I pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thine son David.",
  "9": "And David's young men came and told Nabal all those words in the name of David and then stopped.",
  "10": "And Nabal answered David's servants and said: What is David? and what is the son of Isai? there is plenty of servants now a days, that break away every man from his master.",
  "11": "I should take my bread, my water and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it men which I wot not whence they be?",

  "15": "And yet the men were very good unto us and did us no displeasure, neither missed we anything, as long as were conversant with them, when we were in the fields.",
  "16": "But they were a wall of defence unto us both by night and also by day, all the while we were with them keeping sheep.",
  "17": "Now take heed and see what thou hast to do, for it is concluded to do mischief unto our master and to all his household. And he is ungracious to speak to.",
  "18": "Then Abigail made haste and took two hundredth loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn, and an hundredth bundles of raisins and two hundredth frails of figs, and laded them on asses,",
  "19": "and said unto her young men: go before me, and see I come after you, and told her husband Nabal nothing thereof.",
  "20": "And as she rode on her ass and was coming down in a slade of the hill, David and his men came down against her, and she met them.",
  "21": "And David said: in vain have I kept all that this fellow had in the wilderness: so that nought was missed that pertained unto him, for he hath quite me with evil for good.",
  "22": "So and so do God unto the enemies of David, as I will not leave of all that pertain to him, by the dawning of the day, ought that pisseth against the wall.",
  "23": "When Abigail saw David, she hasted and lighted off her ass and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,",
  "24": "and fell at his feet and said: Let this unhappy deed be counted mine, my lord, and let thine handmaid speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thy handmaid.",
  "25": "Let not my lord regard this unthrifty man Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him. But I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord which thou sendest.",
  "26": "And now my lord as sure as the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth, the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand. Furthermore I pray God that thine enemies and they that intend to do my lord evil, may be as Nabal.",
  "27": "And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought, (my lord,) let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.",

  "31": "then shall it be no grudge of conscience unto thee or discourage of heart unto my lord, that thou sheddest blood causeless and didst avenge thyself. And moreover when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then think on thine handmaid.",
  "32": "Then said David to Abigail: blessed be the LORD God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me.",
  "33": "And blessed be thy behaviour, and blessed be thou which hath kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand.",
  "34": "For in very deed as sure as the LORD God of Israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and met me, there had not been left Nabal by the dawning of the day, a pisser against the wall.",
  "35": "And so David received of her hand that she brought him, and said to her: go in peace to thine house. And see I have obeyed thy voice and have received thee to grace.",
  "36": "And when Abigail came to Nabal: behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king, and Nabal's heart was merry within him, and he was drunk a good. Wherefore she told him nought neither little nor more, until the morrow day.",
