  "4": "And when they were up early in the next morning behold, Dagon lay grovelling upon the ground before the ark of the LORD, and his head and his two hands cut off upon the threshold, that the body onely was left on him.",
  "5": "Wherefore neither the priests of Dagon, neither any man that cometh into Dagon's house might tread on the threshold of Dagon in Asdod, unto this day.",
  "6": "But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Asdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with Emerods, both Asdod and all the coasts thereof.",
  "7": "And when the men of Asdod saw that it was so, they said: the ark of the God of Israel shall not abide here with us, for his hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our god.",

  "11": "Then they sent and fetched all the lords of the Philistines unto them and said: send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go home again unto his own place, that it slay us not with our people. For there was a plague of death thorowout all the city, and the hand of God was exceeding sore there,",
  "12": "insomuch that they which died not, were smitten with the Emerods: so that the cry of the city went up to heaven."
