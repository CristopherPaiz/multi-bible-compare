  "1": "And as David dwelt in his house he said to Nathan the prophet: lo, I dwell in an house of Cedar tree: and the Ark of the LORD's covenant dwelleth under curtains.",
  "2": "And Nathan said to David: do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee.",
  "3": "But the same night the word of God came to Nathan saying:",
  "4": "go and tell David my servant, thus sayeth the LORD, thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in.",
  "5": "For I have dwell in no house since I brought out the children of Israel unto this day: But have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another.",
  "6": "Neither in any place wheresoever I have walked thorowout all Israel, spake I ever one word to any of the judges of Israel which I commanded to feed my people, saying: why build ye me not an house of Cedar tree?",
  "7": "Now therefore thus say unto my servant David: thus sayeth the LORD of Hosts: I took thee out of the pasture from after sheep, that thou shouldest be captain over my people Israel.",
  "8": "And I have been with thee in all thou tookest in hand, and have weeded out all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a name like the name of the greatest men of the earth.",
  "9": "And I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will make it fast, and they shall dwell under it and shall move no more. Neither shall the children of wickedness vex them any more as at the beginning,",
  "10": "and since the time I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and will bring under all thine enemies (for I told thee that the LORD would build thee an house).",
  "11": "But when thy days be expired, that thou must go after thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons and will settle his kingdom.",
  "12": "He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his seat for ever.",
  "13": "I will be his father and he shall be my son, and I will not put my mercy away from him as I did from him that was before thee.",
  "14": "But I will set him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever, and his seat shall be sure for ever.",
  "15": "When Nathan had told David according to all these words, and to all this vision, king David went",
  "16": "and sat him before the LORD and said: what am I O LORD God and what is mine household, that thou hast promoted me thus far.",
  "17": "And yet this seemed little in thine eyes O God. But that thou shouldest speak of thy servant's house for a great while to come: and hast looked upon me as upon a man of high degree O LORD God.",
  "18": "What can David desire more of thee, wherein thou shouldest make thy servant more glorious? Thou knowest thy servant:",
  "19": "And LORD for thy servant's sake, even according to thine own heart thou hast done all this magnificence,",
  "20": "to shew all bounteousness LORD, there is none like thee, nor any God save thou, according to all that we have heard with our ears.",
  "21": "Moreover what nation on the earth is like thy people Israel, which God went and redeemed to be his own people, and to make thee a name of excellency and terribleness, with casting out nations from before thy people,",
  "22": "for ever, and thou LORD art become their God.",
  "23": "And now LORD the thing thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house be true for ever, and do as thou hast said.",
  "24": "And thy name continue and wax great for ever, that it be said: the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel is God in Israel, and the house of David thy servant be stable before thee.",
  "25": "For thou Lord(God) hast told thy servant, that thou wilt build him an house. And therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.",
  "26": "And now LORD thou art the very God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant.",
  "27": "Now therefore go to and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue before thee for ever. For what thou blessest, O LORD that is blessed for ever."
