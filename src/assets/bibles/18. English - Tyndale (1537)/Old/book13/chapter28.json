  "4": "Moreover the LORD God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever, for he chose Juda to be a captain: and in the house of Juda the house of my father, and of the sons of my father he had a lust to me, to make me king over all Israel.",

  "6": "And he said unto me: Salomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father,",
  "7": "and will stablish his kingdom for ever. If he will harden himself to do my commandments, and my laws, as it goeth this day.",
  "8": "And now I say unto you before all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God: keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God, that ye may enjoy a good land and inherit your children after you for ever.",
  "9": "And thou Salomon my son: know God thy father and serve him with a pure heart and lust of soul. For the LORD searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the Imaginations of thoughts. If thou shalt seek him, he will be found of thee: But and if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.",
  "10": "Take heed now, for the LORD hath chosen thee, to build an house of thy sanctuary. Be strong and do it.",
  "11": "And David gave Salomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses that longed thereto, and of the storehouses, upper chambers, innermer parlors and of the house of the Mercyseat:",
  "12": "and the example of all that was in his mind, both of the courts of the house of the LORD and of the treasure houses round about, for the treasures of the house of God and for the treasure of the dedicate gifts,",
  "13": "and of the companies of the priests and Levites that waited by course, and of all workmanship, that should serve for the house of the LORD, and for all vessels that should serve in the house of the LORD.",
  "14": "And appointed him what weight of gold should serve for things of gold thorowout all vessels for whatsoever use it served: and what weight of silver should suffice for all manner of vessels of silver, for whatsoever purpose they served.",
  "15": "And the weight of the golden candlesticks and of their lamps of gold, the weight for every candlestick and for their lamps. And for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick and also for her lamps according to the office of every candlestick.",

  "17": "And for fleshhooks, basins and drinking pots of pure gold. And for cups of gold by weight, cup by cup. And for cups of silver by weight, cup by cup.",
  "18": "And for the altar of incense of tried gold by weight. And the similitude of the seat of the Cherubs that stretched out their wings and covered the Ark of the covenant of the LORD.",
  "19": "All was given me by writing of the hand of the LORD, which made me understand all the workmanship of the pattern.",
  "20": "And David said to Salomon his son: harden thyself and be strong and do it, fear not nor let thine heart discourage thee. For the LORD my God is with thee, and shall not leave thee nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work that must serve for the house of the LORD.",
  "21": "Behold the priests and Levites divided in companies, for to do all manner of service that pertaineth to the house of God, and beside that, thou hast with thee for all manner of workmanship, all that are willing and wise for any manner of service. And the lords and all the people are at thy commandment in all things."
