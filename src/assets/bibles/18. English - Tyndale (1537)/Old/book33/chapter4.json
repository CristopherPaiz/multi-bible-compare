  "1": "But in the latter days it will come to pass, that the hill of the LORD's house shall be set up higher than any mountains or hills: Yea the people shall prease unto it,",
  "2": "and the multitude of the Gentiles shall haste them thither, saying: Come, let us go up to the hill of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob: that he may teach us his way, and that we may walk in his paths. For the law shall come out of Sion, and the word of God from Jerusalem;",
  "3": "And shall give sentence among the multitude of the Heathen and reform the people of far countries: so that of their swords they shall make plowshares, and scythes of their spears. One people shall not lift up a sword against another, yea they shall no more learn to fight:",
  "4": "but every man shall sit under his vineyard and under his fig tree, and no man to fray him away: for the mouth of the LORD of Hosts hath spoken it.",
  "5": "Therefore, where as all people have walked every man in the name of his own god, we will walk in the name of our GOD for ever and ever.",
  "6": "At the same time, sayeth the LORD, will I gather up the lame and the outcasts, and such as I have chastened:",
  "7": "and will give issue unto the lame, and make of the outcasts a great people: and the LORD himself shall be their king upon the mount Sion, from this time forth for evermore.",
  "8": "And unto thee (O thou tower of Eder, thou stronghold of the daughter Sion) unto thee shall it come: even the first lordship and kingdom of the daughter Jerusalem.",
  "9": "Why then art thou now so heavy? is there no king in thee? are thy counselors away that thou art so pained, as a woman in her travail?",
  "10": "And now (O thou daughter Sion) be sorry, let it grieve thee as a wife labouring with child: for now must thou get thee out of the city, and dwell upon the plain field: Yea unto Babylon shalt thou go, there shalt thou be delivered, and there the LORD shall lowse thee from the hand of thine enemies.",
  "11": "Now also are there many people gathered together against thee, saying what, Sion is cursed, we shall see our lust upon her.",
  "12": "But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, they understand not his counsel, that shall gather them together as the sheaves in the barn.",
  "13": "Therefore get thee up, O thou daughter Sion, and thresh(throsh) out the corn: For I will make thy horn iron. and thy claws brass, that thou mayest grind many people: their goods shalt thou appropriate unto the LORD, and their substance unto the ruler of the whole world."
