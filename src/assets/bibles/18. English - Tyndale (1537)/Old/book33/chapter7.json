  "1": "Woe is me: I am become as one, that goeth a gleaning in the harvest. There are no more grapes to eat, yet would I fain (with all my heart) have of the best fruit.",
  "2": "There is not a godly man upon earth, there is not one righteous among men. They labour all to shed blood, and every man hunteth his brother to death:",
  "3": "yet they say they do well when they do evil. As the prince will, so sayeth the judge: that he may do him a pleasure again. The great man speaketh what his heart desireth: and the hearers allow him.",
  "4": "The best of them is but as a thistle, and the most righteous of them is but as a brier in the hedge. But when the day of thy preachers cometh, that thou shalt be visited: then shall they be wasted away.",
  "5": "Let no man believe his friend, nor put his confidence in a prince. Keep the port of thy mouth, from her that lieth in thy bosom:",
  "6": "for the son shall put his father to dishonour, the daughter shall rise against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law: and a man's foes shall be even they of his own household.",
  "7": "Nevertheless I will look up unto the LORD, I will patiently abide God my saviour: my God shall hear me.",
  "8": "O thou enemy of mine, rejoice not at my fall, for I shall get up again: and though I sit in darkness, yet the LORD is my light.",
  "9": "I will bear the punishment of the LORD (for why, I have offended him) till he sit in judgement upon my cause, and see that I have right. He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall see his righteousness.",
  "10": "She that is mine enemy shall look upon it, and be confounded, which now sayeth. Where is thy LORD God? Mine eyes shall behold her, when she shall be trodden down, as the clay in the streets.",
  "11": "The time will come, that thy gaps shall be made up, and the law shall go abroad:",
  "12": "and at that time shall they come unto thee, from Assur unto the strong cities, and from the strong cities unto the river: from the one sea to the other, from the one mountain to the other.",
  "13": "Notwithstanding the land must be wasted, because of them that dwell therein, and for the fruits of their own Imaginations.",
  "14": "Therefore feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage which dwell desolate in the wood: that they may be fed upon the mount of Charmell, Basan and Gilead as afore time.",
  "15": "Marvelous things will I shew them, like as when they came out of Egypt.",
  "16": "This shall the Heathen see, and be ashamed for all their power: so that they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, and stop(stoppe) their ears.",
  "17": "They shall lick the dust like a serpent, as the worms of the earth, that tremble in their holes. They shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and they shall fear thee.",
  "18": "Where is there such a God as thou? that pardonest wickedness, and forgivest the offenses of the remnant of thine heritage? He keepeth not his wrath for ever. And why? his delight is to have compassion:",
  "19": "he shall turn again, and be merciful to us: he shall put down our wickednesses, and cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea.",
  "20": "Thou shalt keep thy trust with Jacob, and thy mercy for Abraham, like as thou hast sworn unto our fathers long ago. [The end of the prophecy of Micheas.]"
