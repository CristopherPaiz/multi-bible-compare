  "1": "When Israel was young, I loved him: and called my son out of the land of Egypt.",
  "2": "But the more they were called, the more they went back, offering unto Idols, and censing Images.",
  "3": "I learned Ephraim to go, and bare them in mine arms, but they regarded not me, that would have helped them.",
  "4": "I led them with cords of friendship, and with bands of love. I was even he, that laid the yoke upon their necks. I gave them their fodder myself,",
  "5": "that they should not go again into Egypt. And now is Assur their king: for they would not turn unto me.",
  "6": "Therefore shall the sword begin in their cities, the store that they have laid up,(likened unto) shall be destroyed and eaten: (up:) and that because of their own imaginations.",
  "7": "My people hath no lust to turn unto me, their prophets lay the yoke upon them, but they ease them not of their burthen.",
  "8": "What great things have I given thee, O Ephraim? how faithfully have I defended thee, O Israel? have I dealt with thee as with Adam? or have I entreated thee like Seboim? No, my heart is otherwise minded. Yea my mercy is to fervent:",
  "9": "therefore have I not turned me to destroy Ephraim in my wrothful displeasure. For I am God, and no man, I am even that holy one in the middest of thee, though I came not within the city.",
  "10": "The LORD roareth like a lion, that they may follow him: yea as a lion roareth he, that they may be afraid like the children of the sea:",
  "11": "that they may be scattered(scarred) away from Egypt, as men scare birds: and frayed away (as doves use to be) from the Assirian's land: and that because I would have them tarry at home, sayeth the LORD.",
  "12": "But Ephraim goeth about me with lies, and the house of Israel dissembleth. Only Juda holdeth him with God, and with the true holy things."
