  "1": "This is the word of the LORD, that came unto Oseas the son of Beeri, in the days of Oseas, Joathan, Ahaz, and Jezekiah kings of Judah: and in the time of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israell.",
  "2": "First, when the LORD spake unto Oseas, he said unto him: Go thy way, take an harlot to thy wife, and get children by her: for the land hath committed great whoredom against the LORD.",
  "3": "So he went, and took Gomer the daughter of Deblaim: which conceived, and brought forth a son.",
  "4": "And the LORD said unto him: Call his name Iesrael, for I will shortly avenge the blood of Iesrael upon the house of Jehu,(Iehu) and will bring the kingdom of the house of Israell to an end.",
  "5": "Then will I break the bow of Israell in the valley of Iesrael.",
  "6": "She conceived yet again, and bare a daughter. And he said unto him: Call her name Loruhamah (that is, not obtaining mercy) for I will have no pity upon the house of Israell, but forget them, and put them clean out of remembrance.",
  "7": "Nevertheless I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them even thorow the LORD their God. But I will not deliver them thorow any bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.",
  "8": "Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived again, and bare a son.",
  "9": "Then said he: call his name Lo amy. For why? ye are not my people, therefore will not I be yours.",
  "10": "And though the number of the children of Israell be as the sand of the sea, which can neither be measured nor told: yet in the place where it is said unto them; Ye be not my people: even there shall it be thus reported of them: they be the children of the living God.",
  "11": "Then shall the children of Judah(Iuda) and the children of Israel be gathered together again, and chose themselves one head, and then depart out of the land: for great shall be the day of Israel."
