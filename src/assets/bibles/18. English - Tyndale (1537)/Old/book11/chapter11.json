  "1": "But king Salomon loved many outlandish women: the daughter of Pharao: and of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonites and Hethites,",
  "2": "even of nations of which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, see ye come not at them, nor let them come to you: for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods. Nevertheless to such Salomon clave and fell in love with them.",
  "3": "And he had seven hundredth very Queens and three hundredth concubines which turned always his heart.",
  "4": "For when Salomon was old, his wives turned his heart after other gods: so that his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.",
  "5": "And Salomon followed Astaroth the God of the Zidons, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.",
  "6": "And Salomon wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD and continued not after the LORD as did David his father.",
  "7": "After that Salomon built an altar for Chamos the abomination of the Moabites in the hill that standeth before Jerusalem, and unto Moloch the abomination of the children of Ammon.",
  "8": "And likewise did he for all his outlandish wives which burnt cense and offered unto their gods.",
  "9": "Then was the LORD angry with Salomon because his heart turned from the LORD God of Israel which appeared unto him twice,",
  "10": "and gave him a charge of this thing that he should not follow other gods. But he kept not that which the LORD commanded him:",
  "11": "whereupon the LORD said to Salomon: for as much as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept mine appointment and mine ordinances which I have commanded thee, therefore I will rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.",
  "12": "Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, because of David thy father: but I will take it from thy son.",
  "13": "How be it I will not take away all: but will give one tribe to thy son, because of David my servant and because of Jerusalem which I have chosen.",
  "14": "And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Salomon, one Hadad an Edomite and of the king's lineage of Edom.",
  "15": "For when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury them that were slain: and had slain all the men children in Edom,",
  "16": "for six months did Joab remain there and all Israel, till he had destroyed all the men children in Edom.",
  "17": "And this Hadad fled and certain other Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go to Egypt, Hadad being yet a little lad.",
  "18": "And they arose out of Madian and went to Pharan, and took men with them out of Pharan and came to Egypt unto Pharao king thereof, which gave him an house, and appointed him vitailles and gave him lands.",
  "19": "And Hadad gat great favour in the sight of Pharao, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Thahaphnes the Queen.",
  "20": "And the sister of Thahaphnes bare him Senubath his son. And Thahaphnes weaned him in Pharao's house. And he was in Pharao's house among the sons of Pharao.",
  "21": "And when Hadad heard say in Egypt that David was laid to sleep with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead also, he said to Pharao let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.",
  "22": "Then said Pharao unto him: what lackest thou here with me, that thou wouldest go to thine own country? And he said, nothing: how be it let me go.",
  "23": "And God stirred up another adversary, one Razon the son of Eliada, which fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah his master.",
  "24": "Which Razon gathered men unto him and became captain over the company, when David slew them. And they went to Damasco and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damasco.",
  "25": "And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Salomon, with the evil that Hadad did, which abhorred Israel and reigned in Siria.",
  "26": "And Jeroboam the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Zaredah (whose mother was called Zeruah and was a widow and Salomon's servant) lifted up his hand against the king. And hereof came it, that he lifted up his hand against the king.",
  "27": "Salomon built Mello and mended broken places in the city of David his father.",
  "28": "And this fellow Jeroboam was an active man. And when Salomon saw the young man, that he wrought so lustily in the work, he made him ruler over all the charges of the house of Joseph.",
  "29": "And it chanced at that season as Jeroboam was gone out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahiah the Silonite met him by the way, having a new mantle on him, and they two alone in the field.",
  "30": "And Ahiah caught the new mantle that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces,",
  "31": "and said to Jeroboam: take thee ten pieces. For this sayeth the LORD God of Israel: behold, I will rent the kingdom out of the hands of Salomon and will give ten tribes to thee,",
  "32": "and he shall have one, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:",
  "33": "because they have forsaken me, and have bowed themselves unto Astaroth the God of the Zidons, and to Camos the God of the Moabites and to Milcom the God of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that pleaseth me, and mine ordinances and customs, as David his father.",
  "34": "How be it I will take none of the kingdom out of his hand: but will make him chief all his life long, for David my servant's sake, which I chose: because he kept my commandments and ordinances.",
  "35": "But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give unto thee ten tribes of it:",
  "36": "and will give his son one, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me, to put my name there.",
  "37": "And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign upon all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over Israel.",
  "38": "And if thou shalt hearken unto all that I command thee, and shalt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight, that thou keep mine ordinances and commandments as David my servant did: then will I be with thee and build thee an house that shall continue, as I built for my servant David, and will give Israel unto thee.",
  "39": "And therewith will I vex the seed of David, but not for ever.",
  "40": "And Salomon sought to kill Jeroboam: wherefore Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt unto Sesak king of Egypt and continued there until the death of Salomon.",
  "41": "And the rest of the Acts of Salomon and all that he did, and his wisdom are written in the book of the Acts of Salomon.",
  "42": "And the time that Salomon reigned in Jerusalem upon all Israel, was forty year.",
  "43": "And then he laid him to rest with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
