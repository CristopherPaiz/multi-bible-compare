  "1": "And it came to pass the four hundredth and fourscore year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, and the fourth year of the reign of Salomon upon Israel, and the second month called Zif that he began to build the temple unto the LORD.",
  "2": "And the house which Salomon built for the LORD, was three score cubits long and twenty broad and thirty cubits high.",
  "3": "And the porch that was before the body of the temple, was twenty cubits long after the measure of the breadth of the house, and ten broad, even at the very end of the house.",
  "4": "And he made unto the house windows to open and shut.",
  "5": "And under the walls of the house he made galleries round about, both round about the temple and also the quere. And so made sides round about.",
  "6": "And the nethermost gallery was five cubits broad and the middle gallery six. And the third seven cubits broad. For he made the walls without whereon the beams lay, ever thinner and thinner, so that they were not fastened in the walls of the house.",
  "7": "And the house was built of stone made perfect all ready yer it was brought thither, so that there was neither hammer or axe either any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.",
  "8": "And the door of the middle gallery was in the end of the house on the right side. And men went up with winding stairs into the middle gallery, and out of the middle into the third.",
  "9": "And so he built the house and finished it, and roofed it with beams of Cedar timber made hollow and joined together.",
  "10": "And then he built chambers over all the temple of five cubits height, and coupled the house together with beams of Cedar.",
  "11": "And the word of the LORD came to Salomon, saying:",
  "12": "concerning the house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in mine ordinances and execute my laws and keep all my commandments, to walk in them: then will I make good unto thee, my promises which I promised David thy father.",
  "13": "And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel.",
  "14": "And so therefore Salomon built the house and finished it",
  "15": "and sealed the walls of the house within, with ribs of Cedar tree: even from the pavement unto the roof did he sile it within, and boarded the floor of the house with planks of fir.",
  "16": "And he sealed twenty cubits in the end of the temple both floor and walls with Cedar, and dressed it within to be the quere and place most holy.",
  "17": "And the first house, that is to say, the body of the temple, was forty cubits long.",
  "18": "And the Cedar of the house within was carved with knops and graven with flowers, and all was Cedar timber, so that no stone was seen.",
  "19": "And the quere that was within the temple, he prepared to set there the Ark of the appointment of the LORD.",
  "20": "And the quere was twenty cubits long, and twenty in breadth and twenty in height. And he sealed it with pure gold, and boarded the altar with Cedar.",
  "21": "And Salomon sealed the house within also with pure gold. And he made golden bars run along the quere, which he had covered with gold.",
  "22": "And the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had ended it. And the altar that was in the quere he overlaid with gold also.",
  "23": "And within the quere he made two Cherubins of olive tree, ten cubits high apiece,",
  "24": "and every wing five cubits long: so that from the uttermost part of one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.",
  "25": "And the other Cherub was ten cubits high also: so that both the Cherubs were of one measure and one size.",
  "26": "The height of the one Cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other.",
  "27": "And he put the Cherubs in the middle of the inner house. And the Cherubs stretched their wings, so that the one wing of the one touched the one wall, and the one wing of the other touched the other wall. And the other two wings of them touched one another in the midst of the house.",
  "28": "And he overlaid the Cherubs with gold.",
  "29": "And all the walls of the house round about, he garnished with work of Cherubs and paulme trees and graven flowers, both within in the quere and without in the temple.",
  "30": "And the floor of the house he covered with gold both within in the quere and also without in the temple.",
  "31": "And in the entering of the quere he made two doors of olive tree, with the upper and two side posts five square.",
  "32": "And the two doors of olive tree he graved with graving of Cherubs and Paulme trees and graved flowers, and covered them with gold, and laid gold over the Cherubs and also the Paulme trees.",
  "33": "And in like manner unto the door of the temple he made posts of olive tree four square,",
  "34": "and two doors of fir tree, and either door with two folding leaves",
  "35": "and graved thereon Cherubs, Paulme trees and flowers, and covered them with gold made plain by a ruler.",
  "36": "And then he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and one row of Cedar wood.",
  "37": "In the fourth year of his reign was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, even in the month Zif,",
  "38": "and in the eleventh year in the month Bul which is the eighth month, it was full finished in all that pertained thereto, and fashioned as it should be in all points. And so was he seven years in building of it."
