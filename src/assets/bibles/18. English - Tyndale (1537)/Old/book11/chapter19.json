  "9": "and entered there into a cave and lodged there all night. And then the word of the LORD came to him and said what doest thou here, Eliah?",
  "10": "And he answered: I have been thorough angry for the LORD God of Hosts' sake. For the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, and have broken down thine altars and slain the Prophets with the sword, and I onely am left, and they seek my soul to have it too.",

  "16": "And Jehu the son of Namsi, anoint to be king over Israel. And Eliseus the son of Saphat of Abel Mehulah anoint to be Prophet in thy room.",
  "17": "And whoso escapeth the sword of Hazael, him shall Jehu slay: and if any man escape the sword of Jehu, him shall Eliseus slay.",
  "18": "And thereto I have left me seven thousand in Israel, of which never man bowed his knees unto Baal nor kissed him with his mouth.",

  "20": "And he left the oxen and ran after Eliah and said: let me I pray thee, kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said to him: go back again, for what have I done to thee?",
  "21": "And he went back again from after him, and took a yoke of oxen and slew them, and dressed the flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave it the people, and they did eat. And then he arose and went after Eliah and ministered unto him."
