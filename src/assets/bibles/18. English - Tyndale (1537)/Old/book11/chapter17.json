  "1": "And Eliah the Thesbite which was of the inhabiters of Gilead, said unto Ahab: as truly as the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these year, save as I appoint it.",
  "2": "And the word of GOD came to him saying:",
  "3": "get thee hence and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself in the brook Karith that lieth before Jordan:",
  "4": "drink of the river for I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.",
  "5": "And he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: he went and dwelt by the brook Karith that lieth before Jordan.",
  "6": "And the ravens brought him bread and flesh every morning and every evening, and he drank of the brook.",
  "7": "And it chanced after a while that the brook dried up, because there fell no rain upon the earth.",
  "8": "Then came the word of the LORD unto him saying:",
  "9": "up and get thee to Sarephtha a city of Sidon, and dwell there. Behold I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.",
  "10": "And he arose and went to Sarephtha. And when he came to the gate of the city, there was a widow there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said: fetch me I pray thee a little water in a dish that I may drink.",
  "11": "And as she went to fetch it, he cried to her and said: bring me I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.",
  "12": "And she answered: as surely as the LORD thy God liveth, I have no bread, but even an handful of Meal in a pitcher, and a little Oil in a cruse. And see, I have gathered a few sticks for to go and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it and then die.",
  "13": "And Eliah said unto her: fear not, but go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first of all, and bring it out to me: and afterward make for thee and thy son.",
  "14": "For thus sayeth the LORD God of Israel: the pitcher of Meal shall not be wasted neither shall thy oil cruse be without oil, until the LORD have sent rain upon the earth.",
  "15": "And she went and did as Eliah bade. And she and he and her house did eat a good space,",
  "16": "and the pitcher of meal wasted not neither was the oil cruse without oil according to the word of the LORD which he spake thorow Eliah.",
  "17": "And after these things, it happened that the son of the wife of the house fell sick. And his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.",
  "18": "Then said she unto Eliah what have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me, that my sin should be thought on and my son slain?",
  "19": "And Eliah said unto her: give me thy son. And he took him out of her lap and carried him up into a loft where he lay, and laid him upon his own bed,",
  "20": "and called unto the LORD and said: O LORD my God, hast thou been so evil unto the widow with whom I sojourn, that thou hast slain her son?",
  "21": "And he stretched himself upon the lad three times, and called unto the LORD and said: O LORD my God, let the lad's soul come into him again.",
  "22": "And the LORD heard the voice of Eliah, and the soul of the lad came into him again and he revived.",
  "23": "And Eliah took the boy and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and said: see, thy son liveth.",
  "24": "Then the wife said to Eliah: now I know that thou art God's man, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth, is truth."
