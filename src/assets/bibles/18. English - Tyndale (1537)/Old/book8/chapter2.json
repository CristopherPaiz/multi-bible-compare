  "1": "And Noemi had a kinsman of her husband's, a man of might, of the kindred of Elimelec, named Booz.",
  "2": "And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Noemi, let me go to the field and lease and gather ears, after whomsoever I find grace in his sight. And she said unto her: go my daughter.",
  "3": "And she went and came and gathered after the harvest men, and her chance was that part of the field pertained unto Booz which was of the kindred of Elimelec.",
  "4": "And behold, Booz came from Bethlehem and said unto the harvest men, the LORD be with you. And they answered him, the LORD bless thee.",
  "5": "Then said Booz unto the young man that had the oversight of the harvest men. Whose damsel is this?",
  "6": "And the young man that was set to oversee the harvest men answered and said: it is the Moabitish damsel that came with Noemi out of the country of Moab,",
  "7": "and she said, let me I pray thee, lease and gather after the harvest men, the ears that remain. And so she came, and hath continued even from the morning unto now, and tarried not long in the house.",
  "8": "Then said Booz unto Ruth: hearest thou my daughter: go to no other field to gather, neither go from hence: but abide by my maidens.",
  "9": "Thine eyes are on a field that shall be reaped: go after the maidens therefore, for I have charged the young men, that they touch thee not. Moreover when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels and drink of that which the lads have drawn.",
  "10": "Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him: how is that I have found grace in thine eyes, to know me, seeing: I am an alien.",
  "11": "And Booz answered and said unto her: all is told me that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband, how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land where thou wast born, and art come unto a nation which thou knewest not in time past.",
  "12": "The LORD quite thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel unto whom thou art come, to trust under his wings.",
  "13": "Then she said unto him, let me find favour in thy sight my lord, for thou hast comforted me and hast spoken heartily unto thy maid, which yet can not be like unto one of thy maids.",
  "14": "And Booz when the time of refection was come, said unto her: come hither and eat of the bread, and dip thy sop in the vinegar. And she sat down by the reapers, and he raught her parched corn. And so she did eat and was sufficed and left part.",
  "15": "And when she was risen up to gather, Booz said to the young men saying: let her gather the ears that remain and do her no despite.",
  "16": "And thereto pull out of the sheaves for her and let it lie, that she may gather it up, and rebuke her not.",
  "17": "And so she gathered until even and then threshed that she had gathered, and it was upon an epha of barley.",
  "18": "And she took it up and went to the city, and shewed her mother-in-law what she had gathered. And thereto she plucked out and gave to her that she had reserved when she had eaten enough.",
  "19": "Then said her mother-in-law unto her, where gatheredst thou today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that knew thee. And she shewed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought and said: the man's name with whom I wrought today is Booz.",
  "20": "Then said Noemi unto her daughter-in-law: blessed be he for he ceaseth not to do the same goodness to the dead that he did to the living. And Noemi said unto her: the man is nigh unto us, even of our next kin.",
  "21": "And Ruth the Moabite said: he bade me also that I should continue with his young men until they had ended all that harvest he hath.",
  "22": "Then said Noemi unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, it is best my daughter that thou go out with his maidens, and that no man meet thee in any other field.",
  "23": "And so she kept her by the maidens of Booz, to gather unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest also: and dwelt with her mother-in-law."
