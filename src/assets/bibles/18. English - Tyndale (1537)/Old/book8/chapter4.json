  "1": "Then went Booz unto the gate and sat him down there: and behold, the kinsman of which Booz spake came by. Unto whom he said come and sit down here, and called him by his name. And he turned in and sat down.",
  "2": "Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, sit ye down here. And they sat down.",
  "3": "Then he said unto the kinsman: Noemi that is come again out of the country of Moab, will sell a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelec's.",
  "4": "And I thought to do thee to wete and bid thee buy it before the inhabiters and elders of my people, if thou be disposed to challenge it: but and if thou wilt not purchase it, then tell me that I may wete it. For there is none to challenge it save thou, and I next thee. And the other answered I will purchase it.",
  "5": "Then said Booz, what day thou buyest the field of the hand of Noemi, thou must take also Ruth the Moabite the wife of the dead to stir up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.",
  "6": "Then said the kinsman, I can not purchase it for marrying of mine own inheritance: take thou my right to thee, for I can not purchase it.",
  "7": "Now this was the manner of old time in Israel concerning purchase and changing, for to establish all things: that a man must pluck off his shoe and give it his neighbour, and this was a witness in Israel.",
  "8": "And the kinsman said to Booz, buy it thou: and so drew off his shoe.",
  "9": "Then said Booz unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelec's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi.",
  "10": "And moreover Ruth the Moabite the wife of Mahalon, do I take unto me to wife to stir up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that his name be not put out from among his brethren, and from the gate of his city: ye are witnesses this day.",
  "11": "And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said we are witnesses: the LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rahel and Lea, which twain did build the house of Israel: that she may do virtuously in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem,",
  "12": "and that thine house be like the house of Pharez, whom Thamar bare unto Juda, even of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.",
  "13": "And so Booz took Ruth, and she was his wife. And he went in unto her, and the LORD gave that she conceived and bare a son.",
  "14": "And the women said unto Noemi: blessed be the LORD the which hath not left thee without an heir this day that shall have a name in Israel,",
  "15": "and that shall bring thy life again and cherish thine old age. For thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee hath borne him that is better to thee than seven sons.",
  "16": "And Noemi took the child and laid it in her lap, and became nurse unto it.",
  "17": "And her neighbours gave it a name saying: there is a child borne to Noemi, and called it Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.",
  "18": "This is the generation of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron:",
  "19": "Hezron begat Ram, Ram begat Aminadab,",
  "20": "Aminadab begat Nahason, Nahason begat Salmon,",
  "21": "Salmon begat Booz, Booz begat Obed,",
  "22": "Obed begat Isai, Isai begat David. [Thus endeth the book of Ruth.]"
