  "1": "And when David was a little past the top of the hill: behold Ziba the servant of Miphiboseth came against him with a couple of Asses saddled, and upon them two hundredth loaves and one hundredth bunches of Resinges, and an hundredth frayls of dried figs, and a bottle of wine.",
  "2": "Then said the king to Ziba: what hast thou there? And Ziba said: Asses for the king's household to ride on, and bread and fruit for the young men to eat, and wine to drink, if any man faint in the wilderness.",
  "3": "Then said the king: where is thy master's son? and Ziba said unto the king: behold, he tarrieth still at Jerusalem. For he said: this day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.",
  "4": "Then said the king to Ziba: behold, thine are all that pertained to Miphiboseth. And Ziba answered: I beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight my lord king.",
  "5": "And when king David came to Bahurim: behold, thence came out a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei the son of Gera, and he came out cursing.",
  "6": "And thereto he cast stones at David and at all the servants of king David, all the people and all the men of war going part on his right hand, and part on his left.",
  "7": "And thus said this Semei as he cursed: come forth, come forth thou blood shedder and thou unthrifty man.",
  "8": "The LORD hath brought upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned, and he hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son. And thou art wrapped about with thine own mischief, because thou art a blood shedder.",
  "9": "Then said Abisai the son of Zaruiah unto the king: why doth this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go and take off the head of him.",
  "10": "And the king said: what have I to do with you ye sons of Zaruiah: let him curse: for the LORD hath bid him curse David. And who dare presume to say wherefore doth he so?",
  "11": "And David said to Abisai, and to all his servants: behold, my son which came out of mine own bowels seeketh my life. How much more may this son of Jemini do it? Suffer him therefore to curse, for the LORD hath bidden him:",
  "12": "haply the LORD will look on my wretchedness, and do me good for his cursing this day.",
  "13": "And thus as David and his men went by the way, Semei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and cast dust.",
  "14": "And the king and all that were with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.",
  "15": "And Absalom and all the people of the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahitophel with him.",
  "16": "And as soon as he was come: Husai the Arachite went unto Absalom and said unto him: God save the king, God save the king.",
  "17": "And Absalom said again to Husai: is this the kindness thou owest to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with him?",
  "18": "And Husai said unto Absalom: nay not so, but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I dwell.",
  "19": "And furthermore unto whom shall I do service but even to his son? And as I was servant before with thy father, even so shall I be with thee.",
  "20": "Then spake Absalom to Ahitophel give counsel what is best for us to do.",
  "21": "And Ahitophel said unto Absalom: get thee in unto thy father's concubines which he hath left to keep the house. For when all Israel shall hear that thou hast made thy father to stink, then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.",
  "22": "And so they pitched Absalom a tent upon the top of the house. And he went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.",
  "23": "And the counsel of Ahitophel which he counselled in those days, was as a man had asked counsel of God: even so was all the counsel of Ahitophel, both unto David and also unto Absalom."
