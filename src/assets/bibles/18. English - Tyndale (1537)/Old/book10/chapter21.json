  "1": "Then there fell an hunger in the days of David three years, year by year. And David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered: it is for Saul's sake and the house of blood, because he slew the Gabeonites.",
  "2": "And the king called the Gabeonites and said unto them. Now these Gabeonites are not of the children of Israel, but a remnant of the Ammonites, and the children of Israel sware unto them. And yet Saul sought to slay them, for a zeal that he had to the children of Israel and of Juda.",
  "3": "Wherefore David said unto them: what shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I content you that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?",
  "4": "And the Gabaonites said unto him: we have no matter of silver or of gold with Saul or with his house: neither have we any man that we would kill in Israel. Then he said: what say ye that I shall do for you?",
  "5": "and they said unto the king: the man that consumed and imagined to bring us to nought, him we ought to destroy, that nought of him continue in any of the coasts of Israel,",
  "6": "let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, that we may hang them up unto the LORD, in Gabaah of Saul the LORD's elect. And David said: I will give them you.",
  "7": "But the king had compassion on Miphiboseth the son of Jonathas, the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them: that is to say between David and Jonathas the son of Saul.",
  "8": "But he took the two sons of Rezphah the daughter of Aiah which she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Miphiboseth, and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul which she bare to Adriel the son of Berselai the Molathite,",
  "9": "and delivered them unto the hands of the Gabeonites, which hanged them in the hill before the LORD. And they fell all seven together in the first days of harvest: even in the beginning of barley harvest.",
  "10": "And Rezphah the daughter of Aiah took Sackcloth and spread it under her upon the Rock, even from the beginning of harvest until rain dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the Air to fall on them by day nor beasts of the field by night.",
  "11": "And when it was told David what Rezphah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done,",
  "12": "he went and took the bones of Saul, and of Jonathas his son, and of the men of Jabes in Gilead, which they had stolen from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged them in the days when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gelboe.",
  "13": "And he brought thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathas his son, and they fetched away the bones of them that were hanged,",
  "14": "and buried them with the bones of Saul and Jonathas his son in the country of Benjamin, in Zela, in the sepulchre of Cis his father. And when they had performed all that the king commanded, God was then at one with the land.",
  "15": "And the Philistines had yet again war with Israel. And David went down and his servants with him, and fought with the Philistines.",
  "16": "And David waxed fainty, and Jesbi of Nob one of the sons of Haraphah whose spear head weighed three hundredth sicles of brass, and was girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.",
  "17": "But Abisai the son of Zaruiah succoured him and smote the Philistine and killed him. Then the servants of David sware unto him saying: Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that the light of Israel be not put out.",
  "18": "And there was yet after this battle with the Philistines at Nob, in which Sobochai the Husathite slew Saph of the sons of Haraphah.",
  "19": "And there was yet the third battle in Gob, with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of the Jaere Orgim, a Bethlehemite slew one Goliath a Gethite: the staff of whose spear was as great as a weaver's cloth beam.",
  "20": "And there was yet battle in Geth, where was a man of a size and had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes: twenty four in all. And was also of the kindred of Haraphah, and defied Israel.",
  "21": "And Jonathas the son of Samach the brother of David slew him.",
  "22": "These four were of the sons of Haraphah in Geth, and were overthrown by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants."
