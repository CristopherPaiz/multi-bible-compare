  "1": "And it was told Joab, how that the king wept and mourned for Absalom.",
  "2": "And the victory was turned that day into mourning unto all the people. For the people heard say that day, how the king sorrowed for his son,",
  "3": "and the people went stealing into the city, as people confounded steal away, when they flee in battle.",
  "4": "And the king hid his face and cried with a loud voice: my son Absalom, Absalom my son my son.",
  "5": "And Joab went into the house to the king and said: thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and daughters, and the lives of thy wives and concubines,",
  "6": "in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends. Thou hast declared this day that thou camest neither for thy lords nor servants. For this day I do perceive, if Absalom had lived, and all we died this day, that then it had pleased thee well.",
  "7": "Now therefore up and come out, and speak kindly unto thy servants, I swear by the LORD except thou come out, there will not tarry one man with thee this night. And that will be worse unto thee, than all the evil that fell on thee from thine youth unto this hour.",
  "8": "Then the king arose and sat down in the Gate. And it was told unto all the people, how the king sat in the Gate. And then all the people came before the king. But Israel fled every man to his tent.",
  "9": "And all the people were at strife thorowout all the tribes of Israel saying: the king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies. And he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines.",
  "10": "And now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. But Absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle.",
  "11": "Now therefore why are ye so still, that ye bring not the king again. And king David sent to Sadock and Abiathar the priests saying: speak unto the elders of Juda and say: why should ye be the last that should bring again the king to his house, seeing that such tidings is come from all Israel unto the king even to his house?",
  "12": "ye are my brethren, my bones and my flesh: wherefore then should ye be the last that should come to bring the king home again?",
  "13": "And say to Amasa: art thou not my bone and my flesh? And God do so to me and so thereto: except thou be captain of the Host to me for ever in the room of Joab.",
  "14": "And he bowed the hearts of all the men of Juda, as a man would bow the heart of one man: so that they sent word to the king, that he should return with all his servants.",
  "15": "And the king returned and came to Jordan. And Juda came to Gilgal for to go against the king to convey him over Jordan.",
  "16": "And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini which was of Bahurim, hasted and came with the men of Juda against king David,",
  "17": "and a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him. And they whipt over Jordan before the king.",
  "18": "And there went over a Boat to carry over the king's household and to do him pleasure. And Semei the son of Gera fell before the king, as he was come over Jordan",
  "19": "and said unto him: let not my lord impute wickedness unto me, nor let him not remember the wickedness that thy servant did, when my lord the king departed out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to heart.",
  "20": "For thy servant doth know how that I have done amiss. And therefore behold, I am the first this day of all the house of Joseph that am come to meet my lord the king.",
  "21": "But Abisai the son of Zaruiah answered and said: shall Semei not die for that cause: which cursed the LORD's anointed?",
  "22": "And the king said: what matter is between you and me ye sons of Zaruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? There shall no man die this day in Israel: for I know that I am this day king over Israel.",
  "23": "And the king said unto Semei: thou shalt not die, and sware unto him.",
  "24": "And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet nor shaved his beard nor washed his clothes from the time the king departed, until he came again in peace.",
  "25": "And when he was come to Jerusalem toward the king, the king said unto him: wherefore went not thou with me Miphiboseth?",
  "26": "And he said: my lord king, my servant deceived me. For thy servant said: that I would have mine Ass saddled to ride thereon, for to go to the king, because thy servant is lame.",
  "27": "And he hath thereto complained on thy servant unto my lord the king. But my lord the king is as an Angel of God: do therefore what seemeth best in thine eyes.",
  "28": "For all my father's house were but dead men unto my lord the king: and yet didst thou put me among them that eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet, to cry any more unto the king?",
  "29": "And the king said: it needeth thee not to speak any more, for I have said: that thou and Ziba shall divide the lands between you.",
  "30": "And Miphiboseth said unto the king: yea let him take all: for so much as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.",
  "31": "And Berselai the Gileadite came from Rogelim and went over Jordan with the king, to accompany him over Jordan:",
  "32": "which Berselai was a very aged man, even four score year old, and had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim: for he was a man of very great substance.",
  "33": "And the king said unto Berselai: come thou with me, that I may feed thee with me in Jerusalem.",
  "34": "But Berselai said unto the king: of what age am I of, that I should go with the king into Jerusalem.",
  "35": "I am this day four score year old: and therefore can not discern savoury from unsavoury, neither hath thy servant pleasure in that he eateth or drinketh: nor yet delectation in the songs of men or women. It is no need that thy servant be a burden unto my lord the king:",
  "36": "let thy servant go a little way over Jordan with the king: for why should the king render me such a reward?",
  "37": "But let thy servant turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and mother. But lo here is thy servant Chamaam: let him go with my lord the king, and do to him, what shall please thee.",
  "38": "And the king answered: Chamaam shall go with me. And I will do to him that thou shalt be content with. And thereto whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that same will I do for thee.",
  "39": "And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over Jordan, he kissed Berselai and took his leave of him, and he went back again unto his own place.",
  "40": "And then the king went to Gilgal, and Chamaam went with him. Now all the men of Juda were at the bringing over of the king, and but half the men of Israel.",
  "41": "Wherefore all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto him: why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household and all David's men with him over Jordan?",
  "42": "And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: for the king is near of kin to us:(nigh kindred) wherefore be ye angry for that matter? think ye that we eat of the king's cost, or that the king giveth us any gifts?",
  "43": "And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda and said: we have ten parts in the king, and have thereto more right to David than ye. Why then did ye despise us, that our advice had not been first had in restoring our king again? And the words of the men of Juda were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
