  "1": "I saw the Lord(LORDE) standing upon the alter, and he said: smite the door check, that the posts may shake withal. For their covetousness shall fall upon all their heads, and their posterity shall be slain with the sword. They shall not flee away, there shall not one of them escape, nor be delivered.",
  "2": "Though they were buried in the hell, my hand shall fetch them from thence: though they climb up to heaven, yet shall I cast them down:",
  "3": "though they hide themselves upon the top of Carmel, yet shall I seek them out, and bring them from thence: Though they creep down from my sight in to the deep of the sea, I shall command the serpent, even there to bite them.",
  "4": "If they go away before their enemies in to captivity, then shall I command the sword, there to slay them. Thus will I set mine eyes upon them, for their harm and not for their wealth.",
  "5": "For when the Lord GOD(LORDE God) of hosts toucheth a land, it consumeth away, and all they that dwell therein, must needs mourn: And why? their destruction shall arise as every stream and run over them, as the flood in Egypt.",
  "6": "He that hath his dwelling in Heaven, and groundeth his tabernacle in the earth: He that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the plain ground: his name is the LORD.",
  "7": "O ye children of Israel, are ye not unto me, even as the Morians, sayeth the LORD: have not I brought Israel out of the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?",
  "8": "Behold, the eyes of the LORD are upon the realm that sinneth, to root it clean out of the earth: Nevertheless I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, sayeth the LORD.",
  "9": "For lo, this I promise: though I sift the house of Israel among all nations (like as they use to sift in a sieve) yet shall not the smallest gravel stone fall upon the earth:",
  "10": "But all the wicked doers of my people, that say: Tush, the plague is not so nigh, to come so hastily upon us: those shall perish with the sword.",
  "11": "At that time will I build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and hedge up his gaps: and look what is broken, I shall repair it: Yea I shall build it again, as it was a fore time,",
  "12": "that they may possess the remnant of Edom, yea and all such people as call upon my name with them, sayeth the LORD, which doth these things.",
  "13": "Behold, the time cometh (sayeth the LORD) that the plowman shall overtake the mower, and the treader of grapes, him that soweth seed. The mountains shall drop sweet wine, and the hills shall be fruitful,(Behold the days will come saith the LORD, that the earer shall overtake the reaper, and treader of grapes the sower of seed. And the mountains shall drop sweetness, and the hills shall be earable.)",
  "14": "and I will turn the captivity of my people of Israel: they shall repair the waste cities, and have them in possession: they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof: they shall make gardens, and enjoy the fruits of them.(And I will turn the captivity of my people Israel: and they shall build the cities that are fallen in decay, and shall inhabit them, and shall plant vines and drink wine, and shall make gardens and eat the fruit of them.)",
  "15": "And I will plant them upon their own ground, so that I will never root them out again from their land which I have given them sayeth the LORD thy God.(And I will plant them their own land, and they shall not be any more plucked out of their land which I have given them saith the LORD thy God.) [The end of the Prophecye of Amos.]"
