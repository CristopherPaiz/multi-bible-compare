  "1": "So all the rulers, and Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Osaiah came with all the people from the least unto the most,",
  "2": "and said unto Jeremy the prophet: O hear our petition, that thou mayest pray for us unto the LORD thy God, and for the remnant, whereof there be very few left of many, as thou seest us:",
  "3": "that the LORD thy God may shew us a way to go in, and tell us, what we should do.",
  "4": "Then Jeremy the Prophet said unto them: I have heard you. Behold, I will pray unto God your LORD, as ye have required me: and look what answer the LORD giveth you, I shall certify you thereof, and keep nothing back from you.",
  "5": "And they said to Jeremy: The LORD of truth and faithfulness be our record, that we will do all, that the LORD thy God commandeth us,",
  "6": "whether it be good or evil. We will hearken unto the voice of our LORD God to whom we send thee that we may prosper, when we have followed the voice of the LORD our God.",
  "7": "And after ten days, came the word of the LORD unto Jeremy.",
  "8": "Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the people that were with him: Yea and all the people from the least to the most,",
  "9": "and said unto them: Thus sayeth the LORD God of Israel unto whom ye sent me, to lay forth your prayers before him:",
  "10": "If ye will dwell in this land, I shall build you up, and not break you down: I shall plant you, and not root you out: for I am pacified, as concerning the trouble that I have done to you.",
  "11": "Fear not the king of Babylon, of whom ye stand in awe: O be not afraid of him, sayeth the LORD: for I will be with you, to help you, and deliver you from his hand.",
  "12": "I will pardon you, I will have mercy upon you, and bring you again into your own land.",
  "13": "Nevertheless, if ye purpose not to dwell in this land, nor to follow the voice of the LORD your God:",
  "14": "but will say thus, we will not dwell here, but go into Egypt: where we shall neither see war, hear the noise of battle, nor suffer hunger, there will we dwell.",
  "15": "Wherefore hear now the word of the LORD, O ye remnant of Judah. Thus sayeth the LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: If ye be wholly purposed to go into Egypt, and to be there as strangers:",
  "16": "the sword that ye fear, shall overtake you in Egypt: and the hunger whereof ye be here afraid, shall hang upon you into Egypt and there ye shall die.",
  "17": "For all they, that of set purpose undertake to go into Egypt, there to ease themselves of their misery, shall perish with the sword, with hunger and pestilence: not one of them shall remain, there shall none escape the plague, that I will bring upon them.",
  "18": "For thus sayeth the LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: Like as my wrath and indignation is come upon the inhabiters of Jerusalem, so shall my displeasure go forth upon you also, if ye go into Egypt: For there ye shall be reviled, abhorred, brought to shame and confusion: and as for this place, ye shall never see it more.",
  "19": "The LORD forbideth you (O ye remnant of Juda) that ye shall not go in to Egypt. And forget not that I have warned you earnestly this day else shall ye beguile yourselves.",
  "20": "For ye sent me unto the LORD your God and said: O pray thou the LORD our God for us: and look what answer the LORD our God giveth thee, that bring us again, and we shall do thereafter.",
  "21": "Now have I shewed, and declared unto you the voice of the LORD your God, for the which cause he hath sent me to you.",
  "22": "If ye will not follow it be sure that ye shall perish with the sword, with hunger and pestilence: even in the same place, where your lust was to go, and dwell."
