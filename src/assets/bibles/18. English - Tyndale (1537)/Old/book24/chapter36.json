  "1": "In the fourth year of Jehoakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, came the word of the LORD unto Jeremy, saying:",
  "2": "Take a book, and write therein all the words, that I have spoken to thee, to Israel, to Judah, and to all the people, from the time that I began for to speak unto thee (in the reign of Josiah) unto this day.",
  "3": "That when the house of Judah heareth of the plague, which I have devised for them, they may peradventure turn, every man from his wicked way, that I may forgive their offenses and sins.",
  "4": "Then did Jeremy call Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote in the book at the mouth of Jeremy, all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him.",
  "5": "And Jeremy commanded Baruch, saying: I am in prison, so that I may not come into the house of the LORD:",
  "6": "therefore go thou thither, and read the book, that thou hast written at my mouth: Namely, the words of the LORD, and read them in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: that the people, whole Judah, and all they that come out of the cities, may hear.",
  "7": "Peradventure they will pray meekly before the face of LORD, and turn, every one from his wicked way. For great is the wrath and displeasure, that the LORD hath taken against this people.",
  "8": "So Baruch the son of Neriah did, according unto all that Jeremy the Prophet commanded him, reading the words of the LORD out of the book in the LORD's house.",
  "9": "And this was done in the fifth year of Jehoakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month when it was commanded, that all the people of Jerusalem should fast before the LORD, and they also that were come from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.",
  "10": "Then read Baruch the words of Jeremy out of the book within the house of the LORD, out of the treasury of Gamariah the son of Saphan the Scribe, which is beside the higher loft of the new door of the LORD's house: that all the people might hear.",
  "11": "Now when Micheah the son of Gamariah the son of Saphan had heard all the words of the LORD out of the book,",
  "12": "he went down to the king's palace into the Scribe's chamber, for there all the princes were set: Elisama the Scribe, Dalaiah the son of Semei, Elnathan the son of Acabor, Gamariah the son of Saphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, with all the princes.",
  "13": "And Micheah told them all the words, that he heard Baruch read out of the book before the people.",
  "14": "Then all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nathaniah, the son of Selamiah, the son of Chusi, unto Baruch, saying: Take in thine hand the book, whereout thou hast read before all the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the book in his hand, and came unto them.",
  "15": "And they said unto him: Sit down, and read the book that we may hear also. So Baruch read, that they might hear.",
  "16": "Now when they had heard all the words, they were abashed one upon another, and said unto Baruch: We will certify the king of all these words.",
  "17": "And they examined Baruch, saying: Tell us, how didst thou write all these words out of his mouth?",
  "18": "Then Baruch answered them: He spake all these words unto me with his mouth, and I alone was with him, and wrote them in the book.",
  "19": "Then said the princes unto Baruch: Go thy way, and hide thee with Jeremy, so that no man know where ye be.",
  "20": "And they went in to the king to the court. but they kept the book in the chamber of Elisama the Scribe, and told the king all the words that he might hear.",
  "21": "So the king sent Jehudi to fetch him the book, which he brought out of Elisama the Scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it, that the king and all the princes, which were about him might hear.",
  "22": "Now the king sat in the winter house, for it was in the ninth Month, and there was a good fire before him.",
  "23": "And when Jehudi had read three or four leaves thereof, he cut the book in pieces with a pen knife, and cast it into the fire upon the hearth, until the book was all brent in the fire upon the hearth.",
  "24": "Yet no man was abashed thereof, or rent his clothes: neither the king himself, nor his servants, though they heard all these words.",
  "25": "Nevertheless Elnathan, Dalaiah, and Gamariah besought the king, that he would not burn the book: notwithstanding the king would not hear them,",
  "26": "but commanded Jerahmeel the son of Amalech, and Saraiah the son of Ezriel and Selamiah the son of Abdiel, to lay hands on Baruch the Scribe, and upon Jeremy the Prophet: but the LORD kept them out of sight.",
  "27": "After now that the king had brent the book, and the sermons which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremy: The word of the LORD came unto Jeremy, saying:",
  "28": "Take another book, and write in it all the foresaid sermons: that were written in the first book, which Jehoakim the king of Judah hath brent.",
  "29": "And tell Jehoakim king of Judah: Thus sayeth the LORD: Thou hast brent the book, and thou thoughtest within thyself: Why hast thou written therein, that the king of Babylon shall come, and make this land waste, so that he shall make both people and cattle to be out of it?",
  "30": "Therefore thus the LORD sayeth, of Jehoakim the king of Judah: There shall none of his generation sit upon the throne of David. His dead corse shall be cast out, that the heat of the day, and the frost of the night may come upon him.",
  "31": "And I will visit the wickedness of him, of his seed, and of his servants. Moreover all the evil that I have promised them (though they heard me not) will I bring upon them, upon the inhabiters of Jerusalem, and upon all Judah.",
  "32": "Then took Jeremy another book, and gave it Baruch the Scribe, the son of Neriah, which wrote therein out of the mouth of Jeremy: all the sermons that were in the first book, which Jehoakim the king of Judah did burn. And there were added unto them many more sermons, than before."
