  "1": "These are the words that the LORD shewed unto Jeremy, saying:",
  "2": "Thus sayeth the LORD God of Israel: Write up diligently all the words, that I have spoken unto thee, in a book.",
  "3": "For lo, the time cometh (sayeth the LORD) that I will bring again the prisoners of my people of Israel and Judah, sayeth the LORD: For I will restore them unto the land, that I gave to their fathers, and they shall have it in possession.",
  "4": "Again, these words spake the LORD, concerning Israel and Judah:",
  "5": "Thus sayeth the LORD: We hear a terrible cry, fear and disquietness.",
  "6": "For what else doth this signify, that I see? Namely, that all strong men smite, every man his hand upon his loins, as a woman in the pain of her travail. Who ever saw a man travail with child? Enquire thereafter, and see. Yea all their faces are marvelous pale.",
  "7": "Alas for this day, which is so dreadful, that none may be likened unto it: and alas for the time of Jacob's trouble, from the which he shall yet be delivered.",
  "8": "For in that day, sayeth the LORD, I will take his yoke from off thy neck, and break thy bonds. They shall no more serve strange gods under him,",
  "9": "but they shall do service unto God their LORD, and to David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.",
  "10": "And as for thee, O my servant Jacob, fear not (sayeth the LORD) and be not afraid, O Israel. For lo, I will help thee also from far, and thy seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall turn again, he shall be in rest, and have a prosperous life, and no man shall make him afraid.",
  "11": "For I am with thee, to help thee, sayeth the LORD. And though I shall destroy all the people, among whom I have scattered thee, yet will I not destroy thee, but correct thee, and that with discretion. For I know, that thou art in no wise without fault.(faute)",
  "12": "Therefore thus sayeth the LORD: I am sorry for thy hurt and wounds.",
  "13": "There is no man to meddle with thy cause: or to bind up thy wounds: there may no man help thee.",
  "14": "All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and care nothing for thee. For I have given thee a cruel stroke, and chastened thee roughly: and that for the multitude of thy misdeeds, for thy sins have had the over hand.",
  "15": "Why makest thou moan for thy harm? I myself have pity of thy sorrow, but for the multitude of thy misdeeds and sins, I have done this unto thee.",
  "16": "And therefore all they that devour thee, shall be devoured, and all thine enemies shall be led in to captivity. All they that make thee waste, shall be wasted themselves: and all those that rob thee, will I make also to be robbed.",
  "17": "For I will give thee thy health again and make thy wounds whole, sayeth the LORD: because they reviled thee, as one cast away and despised, O Sion.",
  "18": "For thus sayeth the LORD: Behold, I will set up Jacob's tents again, and defend his dwelling place. The city shall be builded in her old estate, and their houses shall have their right foundation.",
  "19": "And out of them shall go thanksgiving, and the voice of joy. I will multiply them, and they shall not minish: I shall endue them with honour, and no man shall subdue them.",
  "20": "Their children shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall continue in my sight. And all those that vex them, will I visit.",
  "21": "A captain also shall come of them, and a prince shall spring out from the middest of them: him will I challenge to myself, and he shall come unto me. For what is he, that giveth over his heart to come unto me? sayeth the LORD.",
  "22": "Ye shall be my people also, and I will be your God.",
  "23": "Behold, on the other side shall the wrath of the LORD break out as a stormy water, as a mighty whirl wind: and shall fall upon the heads of the ungodly.",
  "24": "The terrible displeasure of the LORD shall not leave off, until he have done, and performed the intent of his heart, which in the latter days ye shall understand."
