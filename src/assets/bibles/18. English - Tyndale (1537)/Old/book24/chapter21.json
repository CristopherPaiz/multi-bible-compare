  "1": "These are the words that the LORD spake unto Jeremy, what time as king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Sophaniah the son of Maasiah priest, saying:",
  "2": "Ask counsel at the LORD (we Pray thee) of our behalf, for Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon beseigeth us, if the LORD (peradventure) will deal with us, according to his marvelous power, and take him from us.",
  "3": "Then spake Jeremy. Give Zedekiah this answer.",
  "4": "Thus sayeth the LORD God of Israel: behold, I will turn back the weapons, that ye have in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Caldees, which besiege you round about the walls, and I will bring them together into the middest of this city,",
  "5": "and I myself will fight against you, with an outstretched hand, and with a mighty arm, in great displeasure and terrible wrath:",
  "6": "and will smite them, that dwell in this city, yea both man and cattle shall die of the pestilence.",
  "7": "And after this (sayeth the LORD) I shall deliver Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, his people, (and such as are escaped in the city, from the pestilence, sword, and hunger) into the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon: yea into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those that follow upon their lives, which shall smite them with the sword: they shall not pity them, they shall not spare them, they shall have no mercy upon them.",
  "8": "And unto this people thou shalt say: Thus sayeth the LORD: behold, I lay before you the way of life and death.",
  "9": "Whoso abideth in this city, shall perish: either with the sword, with hunger, or with pestilence. But whoso goeth out to hold on the Caldees part, that besiege it, he shall save his life, and shall win his soul for a prey.",
  "10": "For I have set my face against this city (sayeth the LORD) to plague it, and to do it no good. It must be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and be brent with fire.",
  "11": "And unto the house of the king of Judah, say thus: Hear ye the word of the LORD:",
  "12": "(O house of David) for thus sayeth the LORD: Minister righteousness, and that soon, deliver the oppressed from violent power: or ever my terrible wrath break out like a fire, and burn so, that no man may quench it, because of the wickedness of your imaginations.",
  "13": "Behold, (sayeth the LORD) I will come upon you that dwell in the valleys, rocks and fields, and say: Tush, who will make us afraid? or who will come into our houses?",
  "14": "For I will visit you (sayeth the LORD) because of the wickedness of your inventions, and will kindle such a fire in your wood, as shall consume all, that is about you."
