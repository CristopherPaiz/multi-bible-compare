  "1": "Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremy on this manner, when he was yet bound in the court of the prison:",
  "2": "Thus sayeth the LORD, which fullfilleth the thing that he speaketh, the LORD which performeth the thing that he taketh in hand: even he, whose name is the LORD:",
  "3": "thou hast cried unto me, and I have heard thee: I have shewed great and high things, which were unknown unto you.",
  "4": "Thus (I say) spake the LORD God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and the houses of the kings of Judah: that they shall be broken thorow the ordinance and weapons,",
  "5": "when the Caldees come to besiege them: and they shall be filled with the dead carcasses of men, whom I will slay in my wrath and displeasure: when I turn my face from this city, because of all her wickedness.",
  "6": "Behold, (sayeth the LORD) I will heal their wounds and make them whole: I will open them the treasure of peace and truth.",
  "7": "And I will return the captivity of Judah and Israel: and will set them up again as they were afore.",
  "8": "From all misdeeds (wherein they have offended against me) I will cleanse them: And all their blasphemies which they have done against me, when they regarded me not, I will forgive them.",
  "9": "And this shall get me a name, and praise and honour, among all people of the earth, which shall hear all the good, that I will shew unto them: Yea they shall be afraid and astonied at all the good deeds and benefits, that I will do for them.",
  "10": "Moreover thus sayeth the LORD: In this place, whereof ye say that it shall be a wilderness, wherein neither people nor cattle shall dwell: in like manner in the cities of Judah and without Jerusalem (which also shall be so void, that neither people nor cattle shall dwell there)",
  "11": "Shall the voice of gladness be heard again, the voice of the Bridegroom and of the bride, the voice of them that shall sing: Praise the LORD of Hosts, for he is loving and his mercy endureth for ever, and the voice of them that shall offer up gifts in the house of the LORD. For I will restore the captivity of this land, as it was afore, sayeth the LORD.",
  "12": "Thus sayeth the LORD of Hosts: It shall come yet thereto, that in this land, which is void from men and cattle, and in all the cities of the land, there shall be set up shepherds cottages:",
  "13": "in the cities upon the mountains: and in the cities that lie upon the plain, and in the desert. In the land of Ben Jamin, in the fields of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah shall the sheep be numbered again, under the hand of him, that telleth them, sayeth the LORD.",
  "14": "Behold, the time cometh, sayeth the LORD, that I will perform the good thing, which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.",
  "15": "In those days, and at the same time, I will bring forth unto David the branch of righteousness, and he shall do equity and righteousness in the land.(Behold, the days will come saith the LORD, that I will stir up unto David a righteous branch, and he shall reign a king, and shall be wise, and shall do equity and justice in the earth.)",
  "16": "In those days shall Judah be helped, and Jerusalem shall dwell safe, and he that shall call her is even GOD our righteous maker.(And in his days Judah shall be safe, and Israel shall dwell without fear. And this is the name that they shall call him: the LORD our righteousness. Wherefore the days will come saith the LORD, that they shall say no more, the Lord liveth that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. But the LORD liveth which delivered and brought the seed of the house of Israel, out of the land of the north and from all lands whether I thrust them. And they shall dwell in their own land saith the LORD God almighty.)",
  "17": "For thus the LORD promiseth: David shall never want one, to sit upon the stool of the house of Israel:",
  "18": "neither shall the priests and Levites want one to offer alway before me burnt offerings, to kindle the meat offerings, and to prepare the sacrifices.",
  "19": "And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremy after this manner:",
  "20": "Thus sayeth the LORD: May the covenant which I have made with day and night be broken, that there should not be day and night in due season?",
  "21": "Then may my covenant also be broken, which I made with David my servant, and so he not to have a son to reign in his Throne. So shall also the priests and Levites never fail, but serve me.",
  "22": "For like as the stars of heaven may not be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and of the Levites my ministers.",
  "23": "Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremy, saying:",
  "24": "Considerest thou not what this people speaketh? Two kindreds (say they) had the LORD chosen, and those same two hath he cast away. For so far is my people come, that they have no hope to come together any more, and to be one people again.",
  "25": "Therefore thus sayeth the LORD: If I have made no covenant with day and night, and given no statute unto heaven and earth:",
  "26": "then will I also cast away the seed of David my servant: so that I will take no prince out of his seed, to rule the posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But yet I will turn again their captivity, and be merciful unto them."
