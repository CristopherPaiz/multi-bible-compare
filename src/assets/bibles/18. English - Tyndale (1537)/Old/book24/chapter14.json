  "1": "The word of the LORD shewed unto Jeremy, concerning the dearth of the fruits.",
  "2": "Judah shall mourn, men shall not go much more throw his gates: the land shall be no more had in reputation, and the cry of Jerusalem shall break out.",
  "3": "The lords shall send their servants to fetch water, and when they come to the wells, they shall find no water, but shall carry their vessels home empty. They shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall cover their heads.",
  "4": "For the ground shall be dried up, because there cometh no rain upon it. The plowmen also shall be ashamed, and shall cover their heads.",
  "5": "The Hind shall forsake the young fawn, that he bringeth forth in the field because there shall be no grass.",
  "6": "The wild Asses shall stand in the Moss, and draw in their wind like the Dragons, their eyes shall fail for want of grass.",
  "7": "Doubtless our own wickedness reward us: But LORD do thou according to thy name, though our transgressions and sins be many.",
  "8": "For thou art the comfort and help of Israel in the time of trouble. Why wilt thou be as a stranger in the Land, and as one that goeth over the field, and cometh in only to remain for a night?",
  "9": "Why wilt thou make thyself a coward, and as it were a giant that yet may not help? For thou art ours (O LORD) and we bear thy name, therefore forsake us not.",
  "10": "Then spake the LORD, concerning this people that have pleasure to go so nimbly with their feet, and leave not off, and therefore displease the LORD: in so much, that he will now bring again to remembrance all their misdeeds, and punish all their sins.",
  "11": "Yea even thus said the LORD unto me: Thou shalt not pray to do this people good.",
  "12": "For though they fast, I will not hear their prayers. And though they offer burnt offerings and sacrifices, yet will not I accept them. For I will destroy them with the sword, hunger, and pestilence.",
  "13": "Then answered I: O Lord GOD,(LORDE God) the prophets say unto them: Tush, ye shall see no sword, and no hunger shall come upon you, but the Lord(LORDE) shall give you continual rest in this place.",
  "14": "And the LORD said unto me: The prophets preach lies unto them in my name. I have not spoken with them, neither gave I them any charge, neither did I send them: yet they preach unto you false visions, charming vanity, and deceitfulness of their own heart.",
  "15": "Therefore thus sayeth the LORD: As for those prophets that preach in my name, (whom I nevertheless have not sent) and that say: Tush, there shall neither battle, nor hunger be in this land: With sword and with hunger shall those prophets perish,",
  "16": "and the people to whom they have preached shall be cast out of Jerusalem, die of hunger, and be slain with the sword (and there shall be no man to bury them) both they and their wives, their sons and their daughters. For thus will I pour their wickedness upon them.",
  "17": "This shalt thou say also unto them: Mine eyes shall weep without ceasing day and night. For my people shall be destroyed with great harm, and shall perish with a great plague.",
  "18": "For if I go into the field, lo, it lieth all full of slain men: If I come into the city, lo, they be all famished of hunger. Yea their prophets also and priests shall be lead in to an unknown land.",
  "19": "Hast thou then utterly forsaken Juda? (said I) Doest thou so abhor Sion? Or hast thou so plagued us, that we can be healed no more? We looked for peace, and there cometh no good: for the time of health, and lo, here is nothing but trouble.",
  "20": "We knowledge (O LORD) all our misdeeds, and the sins of our fathers, that we have offended thee.",
  "21": "Be not displeased, O LORD, for thy name's sake, forget not thy loving-kindness: Remember the throne of thine honour, break not the covenant, that thou hast made with us.",
  "22": "Are there any among the gods of the Gentiles, that send rain or give the showers of heaven? Dost not thou it O LORD our God, in whom we trust? Yea LORD, thou dost all these things."
