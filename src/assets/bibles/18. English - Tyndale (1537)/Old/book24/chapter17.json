  "1": "Your sin (O ye of the tribe of Judah) is written in the table of your hearts, and graven so upon the edges of your altars with a pen of iron and with an adamant claw:",
  "2": "that your children also may think upon your altars, woods, thick trees, high hills, mountains and fields.",
  "3": "Wherefore, I will make all your substance and treasure be spoiled, for the great sin that ye have done upon your high places thorowout all the coasts of your land.",
  "4": "Ye shall be cast out also from the heritage, that I gave you. And I will subdue you under the heavy bondage of your enemies, in a land that ye know not. For ye have ministered fire to my indignation, which shall burn evermore.",
  "5": "Thus sayeth the LORD: Cursed be the man that putteth his trust in man, and that taketh flesh for his arm: and he, whose heart departeth from the LORD.",
  "6": "He shall be like the heeth that groweth in the wilderness. As for the good thing that is for to come, he shall not see it: but dwell in a dry place of the wilderness, in a salt and unoccupied land.",
  "7": "O Blissed is the man, that putteth his trust in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is himself.",
  "8": "For he shall be as a tree, that is planted by the water side: which spreadeth out the root unto moistness, whom the heat can not harm, when it cometh, but his leaves are green. And though there grow but little fruit because of drought, yet is he not careful, but he never leaveth off to bring forth fruit.",
  "9": "Among all things living, man hath the most deceitful and unsearchable heart. Who shall then know it?",
  "10": "Even I the LORD search(ripe) out the ground of the heart, and try(search) the reins, and reward every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his counsels.",
  "11": "The deceitful maketh a nest, but bringeth forth no young: He cometh by riches, but not righteously. In the middest of his life must he leave them behind him, and at the last be found a very fool.",
  "12": "But thou (O LORD) whose throne is most glorious, excellent and of most antiquity, which dwellest in the place of our holy rest:",
  "13": "Thou art the comfort of Israel. All they that forsake thee, shall be confounded: all they that depart from thee, shall be written in earth, for they have forsaken the LORD the very conduit(condite) of the waters of life.(All that forsake thee, shall be ashamed. And they that depart from thee shall be written in the earth. For they have lost the LORD that is the fountain of the water of life.)",
  "14": "Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be whole: save thou me, and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise.(Heal me LORD, and I shall be whole: save me LORD, and I shall be safe, for thou art he that I praise.)",
  "15": "Behold, these men say unto me: Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come.(Behold they say unto me: where is the word of the LORD? Let it come to pass)",
  "16": "Where as I nevertheless leading the flock in thy ways, have compelled none by violence. For I never desired any man's death, this knowest thou well. My words also are right before thee.(and I enforced no to be a shepherd that should not follow thee: and the day of destruction have I not desired, thou knowest. And that proceeded out of my mouth was right in thy sight.)",
  "17": "Be not now terrible unto me, O LORD, for thou art he in whom I hope, when I am in peril.(Be not terrible unto me LORD: for thou art my trust in the evil day.)",
  "18": "Let my persecutors be confounded, but not me: let them be afraid, and not me. Thou shalt bring upon them the time of their plague, and shall destroy them right sore.(Let them that persecute me be confounded, and let not me be confounded. Let their hearts fail them, and not mine heart fail. Bring upon them an evil day, and bruise them again and again.)",
  "19": "Again, thus hath the LORD said unto me: Go stand under the gate, where thorow the people and the kings of Juda go out and in, yea under all the gates of Jerusalem,",
  "20": "and say unto them: Hear the word of the LORD, ye kings of Juda, and all thou people of Juda, and all ye citizens of Jerusalem, that go thorow this gate:",
  "21": "Thus the LORD commandeth: Take heed for your lives, that ye carry no burthen upon you in the Sabbath, to bring it thorow the gates of Jerusalem:",
  "22": "ye shall bear no burthen also out of your houses in the Sabbath: Ye shall do no labour therein, but hallow the Sabbath, as I commanded your fathers.",
  "23": "How be it they obeyed me not, neither hearkened they unto me: but were obstinate and stubborn, and neither obeyed me, nor received my correction.",
  "24": "Nevertheless, if ye will hear me (sayeth the LORD) and bear no burthen in to the city thorow this gate upon the Sabbath: If ye will hallow the Sabbath, so that ye do no work therein:",
  "25": "then shall there go thorow the gates of this city, kings and princes, that shall sit upon the stool of David: They shall be carried upon chariots, and ride upon horses, both they and their princes. Yea whole Juda and all the citizens of Jerusalem shall go here thorow, and this city shall ever be the more and more inhabited.",
  "26": "There shall come men also from the cities of Judah, from about Jerusalem, and from the land of Ben Jamin, from the plain fields, from the mountains and from the wilderness: which shall bring burntofferings, sacrifices, oblations, and incense, and offer up thanksgiving in the house of the LORD.",
  "27": "But if ye will not be obedient unto me, to hallow the Sabbath: so that ye will bear your burthens thorow the gates of Jerusalem upon the Sabbath: Then shall I set fire upon the gates of Jerusalem, and it shall burn up the houses of Jerusalem, and no man shall be able to quench it."
