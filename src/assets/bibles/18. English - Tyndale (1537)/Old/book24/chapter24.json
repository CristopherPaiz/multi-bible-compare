  "1": "The LORD shewed me a vision; Behold, there stood two maundes of figs before the Temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchodonosor king of Babylon had led away captive Jechoniah the son of Jehoakim king of Judah, the mighty men also of Judah, with the workmasters, and cunning men of Jerusalem, unto Babylon.",
  "2": "In the one maunde were very good figs, even like as those that be first ripe. In the other maunde were very naughty figs, which might not be eaten, they were so evil.",
  "3": "Then said the LORD unto me: What seest thou Jeremy? I said: figs, whereof some be very good, and some so evil, that no man may eat them.",
  "4": "Then came the word of the LORD unto me, after this manner:",
  "5": "Thus sayeth the LORD the God of Israel: like as thou knowest the good figs, so shall I know the men led away, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Caldees, for their profit:",
  "6": "and I will set mine eyes upon them for the best, for I will bring them again in to this land: I will build them up, and not break them down: I will plant them, and not root them out.",
  "7": "And I will give them an heart, to know, how that I am the LORD. They shall be my people, and I will be their God, for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.",
  "8": "And like as thou knowest the naughty figs, which may not be eaten, they are so evil: Even so will I (sayeth the LORD) let Zedekiah the king of Judah, (yea and all his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem that remain over in this land, and them also that dwell in Egypt) to be vexed and plagued in all kingdoms and lands.",
  "9": "And will make them to be a reproof, a common byword, a laughing stock and shame, in all the places, where I shall scatter them.",
  "10": "I will send the sword, hunger and pestilence among them, until I have clean consumed them out of the land, that I gave unto them and their fathers."
