  "1": "Blow out the trumpet in Sion, and cry upon my holy hill, that all such as dwell in the land, may tremble at it: for the day of the LORD cometh, and is hard at hand:",
  "2": "a dark day, a glooming day, a cloudy day, yea and a stormy day, like as the morning spreadeth out upon the hills: Namely, a great and mighty people: such as have not been since the beginning, neither shall be after them for evermore.",
  "3": "Before him shall be a consuming fire, and behind him a burning flame. The land shall be as a garden of pleasure before him, but behind him shall it be a very waste wilderness, and there is no man, that shall escape him.",
  "4": "They are to look upon like bairded horses, and run like horse men.",
  "5": "They skipped up upon the hills, as it were the sound of chariots: as the flame of fire that consumeth the straw, and as a mighty people ready to the battle.",
  "6": "The folk shall be afraid of him, all faces shall be as black as a pot.",
  "7": "These shall run like giants, and leap over the walls like men of war. Every man in his going will keep his array, and not go out of his Path.",
  "8": "There shall not one drive another, but each shall keep his own way. They shall break in at the windows, and not be hurt:",
  "9": "They shall come in to the city, and run upon the walls: They shall climb up upon the houses, and slip in at the windows like a thief.",
  "10": "The earth shall quake before him, yea the heavens shall be moved: The Sun and Moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shine.",
  "11": "The LORD shall shew his voice before his host, for his host is great, strong and mighty to fulfill his commandment. This is that great and marvelous fearful day of the LORD: And who is able to abide it.",
  "12": "Now therefore sayeth the LORD: Turn you unto me with all your hearts, with fasting, weeping and mourning,(And now therefore saith the LORD: Turn to me with all your hearts, in fasting and lamentation.)",
  "13": "rent your hearts, and not your clothes. Turn you unto the LORD your God, for he is gracious and merciful, long suffering and of great compassion: and ready to pardon wickedness.(And tear your hearts and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God.)",
  "14": "Then (no doubt) he also shall turn, and forgive: and after his chastening, he shall let your increase remain, for meat and drink offerings unto the LORD(LORDE) your God:(Who can tell whether the Lord will turn and have compassion and shall leave after him a blessing? Sacrifice and drink offering unto the LORD your God.)",
  "15": "Blow out with the trumpet in Sion, proclaim a fasting, call the congregation,(Blow a trumpet in Sion, proclaim fasting and call a congregation.)",
  "16": "and gather the people together: warn the congregation, gather the elders, bring the children and sucklings together. Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.(Gather the people together, bring the elders to one place, gather the young children and they that suck the breasts, together. Let the bridegroom come out of his chamber and the bride out of her parlour.)",
  "17": "Let the priests serve the LORD betwixt the porch and the alter, weeping and saying: be favourable O LORD, be favourable unto thy people: let not thine heritage be brought to such confusion, lest the Heathen be lords thereof. Wherefore should they say among the Heathen: where is now their God?(Let the priests that minister unto the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and say: spare (Lord) thy people and deliver not thine heritage unto rebuke that the heathen should reign over them. Why should they say: among the nations, where is their God?)",
  "18": "Then shall the LORD be jealous over his land, and spare his people:(And the LORD envied for his land's sake and had compassion on his people.)",
  "19": "yea the LORD shall answer, and say unto his people: Behold, I will send you corn, wine, and oil, so that ye shall have plenty of them: And I will no more give you over to be a reproof among the Heathen.(And the LORD answered and said unto his people Behold, I sent you corn, new wine and oil, that ye shall be satisfied therewith. Neither will I deliver you any more unto the heathen.)",
  "20": "Again, as for him of the North, I shall drive him far from you: and shoot him out in to a dry and waste land, his face toward the east sea, and his hinder parts toward the utmost sea. The stink of him shall go up, and his filthy corruption shall fall upon himself, because he hath dealt so proudly.",
  "21": "Fear not (O land) but be glad and rejoice, for the LORD will do great things.",
  "22": "Be not ye afraid neither (O ye beasts of the field) for the pastures shall be green and the trees shall bear their fruit: the fig trees and vineyards shall give their increase.",
  "23": "Be glad then (O ye children of Sion) and rejoice in the LORD your God, for he hath given you a(the) teacher of righteousness: and he it is that shall send you down showers of rain, early and late in the first month:(Children of Sion be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God. For he hath given you a teacher of righteousness, and will make descend unto you the first rain and the later, as at the beginning.)",
  "24": "so that the garners shall be full of corn, and the presses plenteous in wine and oil.(And the barns shall be full of corn, and the wine presses flow with wine and oil.)",
  "25": "And as for the years that the grasshopper, locust, blasting, and caterpillar (my great host, which I sent among you) have eaten up, I shall restore them to you again:(And I will restore you again with my great power which I have sent unto you, the years which the locusts and caterpillars have devoured.)",
  "26": "so that ye shall have enough to eat, and be satisfied: and praise the name of the LORD your God, that so marvelously hath dealt with you. And my people shall never be confounded anymore.(And ye shall eat and have enough and praise the name of the LORD your God, which hath wrought wonders with you. And my people shall not be in shame for ever.)",
  "27": "Ye shall well know, that I am in the middest of Israel, and that I am your GOD: yea and that there is none other, and my people shall no more be brought to confusion.(And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no more. And my people shall not be in shame for ever.)",
  "28": "After this, will I pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions:",
  "29": "Yea in those days I will pour out my spirit upon servants and maidens.",
  "30": "I will shew wonders in heaven above, and tokens in the earth beneath: blood and fire, and the vapour of smoke.",
  "31": "The sun(Sonne) shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the(yt) great and notable day of the LORD come.",
  "32": "And the time shall come: that whosoever calleth upon the name of the LORD, shall be saved. For upon the mount Sion and at Jerusalem, there shall be a salvation, like as the LORD hath promised: yea and among the other remnant, whom the LORD shall call."
