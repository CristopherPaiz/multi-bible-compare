  "1": "Job answered, and said:",
  "2": "My saying is yet this day in bitterness, and my hand heavy among my groanings.",
  "3": "O that I might see him and find him: O that I might come before his seat,",
  "4": "to plead my cause before him, and to fill my mouth with arguments:",
  "5": "That I might know, what answer he would give me: and that I might understand, what he would say unto me.",
  "6": "Will he plead against me with his great power and strength, or will he lean himself utterly upon me?",
  "7": "Oh no, let him not do so with me. But let him give me like power to go to law, then am I sure to win my matter.",
  "8": "For though I go before, I find him not: If I come behind, I can get no knowledge of him:",
  "9": "If I go on the left side to ponder his works, I can not attain unto them. Again, if I go on the right side, he hideth himself, that I can not see him.",
  "10": "But as for my way, he knoweth it: and tryeth me as the gold in the fire.",
  "11": "Nevertheless my feet keep his path, his high street have I holden, and not gone out of it.",
  "12": "I have not forsaken the commandment of his lips, but look what he charged me with his mouth, that have I shut up in my heart.",
  "13": "It is he him self alone, who will turn him back? He doth as him listeth, and bringeth to pass what he will.",
  "14": "He rewardeth me in to my bosom, and many other things more doth he, as he may by his power.",
  "15": "This is the cause, that I shrink at his presence, so that when I consider him, I am afraid of him.",
  "16": "For in so much as he is God, he maketh my heart soft: and seeing that he is Almighty, he putteth me in fear.",
  "17": "Thus can not I get out of darkness, the cloud hath so covered my face."
