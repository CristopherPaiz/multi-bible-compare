  "7": "Gird up thy loins like a man, and tell me the things that I will ask thee.",
  "8": "Wilt thou disannul my judgment? Or wilt thou condemn me, that thou thyself mayest be made righteous?",

  "21": "He lieth among the reeds in the Mosses,",
  "22": "the fens hide him with their shadow, and the willows of the brook cover him round about.",
  "23": "Lo, without any labour might he drink out of the whole flood, and sup of Jordan without any trail.(travail)",
  "24": "Who dare lay a hand on him openly, and undertake to catch him? Or, who dare put a hook thorow his nose, and lay a snare for him?"
