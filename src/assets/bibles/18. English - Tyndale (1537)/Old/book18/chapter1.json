  "1": "In the land of Hus, there was a man called Job: an innocent and virtuous man, such one as feared God, and eschewed evil.",
  "2": "This man had seven sons, and three daughters.",
  "3": "His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundredth yoke of oxen, five hundredth she asses, and a very great household: so that he was one of the most principal men among all them of the east country.",
  "4": "And his sons went,(His sonnes now wente on every man) and made banquets: one day in one house, another day in another, and sent for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
  "5": "So when they had passed over the time of their banqueting round about, Job sent for them, and cleansed them again, and gat(stode) up early, and offered for everyone a brentoffering. For Job thought thus: peradventure my sons have done some offense, and have been unthankful to God in their hearts. And thus did Job everyday.",
  "6": "Now upon a time, when the servants of God came and stood before the LORD, Sathan came also among them.",
  "7": "And the LORD said unto Sathan: From whence comest thou? Sathan answered the LORD, and said: I have gone about the land and walked thorow it.",
  "8": "Then said the LORD unto Sathan: hast thou not considered my servant Job, and how that he is an innocent and virtuous man: such one as feareth God, and escheweth evil, and that there is none like him in the land?",
  "9": "Sathan answered, and said unto the LORD: Doth Job fear God for naught?",
  "10": "hast thou not preserved him, his house, and all his substance on every side? hast thou not blessed the work of his hands? Is not his possession increased(encreased) in the land?",
  "11": "But lay thine hand upon him a little, touch once all that he hath, and (I hold) he shall curse thee to thy face.",
  "12": "And the LORD said unto Sathan: lo all that he hath, be in thy power: only upon him self see that thou lay not thine hand. Then went Sathan forth from the LORD.",
  "13": "Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,",
  "14": "there came a messenger unto Job, and said: While the oxen were a plowing, and the Asses going in the pasture beside them:",
  "15": "the Sabees came in violently, and took them all away: yea they have slain thy(the) servants with the sword, and I only ran my way, to tell thee.",
  "16": "And while he was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The fire of God is fallen from heaven, it hath consumed, and brent up all thy sheep and servants: and I only ran my way, to tell thee.",
  "17": "In the mean season while he was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Caldees made three armies, and fell upon thy(the) camels, which they have carried away, yea and slain thy servants with the sword: and I only am gotten away, to tell thee:",
  "18": "While he was speaking, there came yet another, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,",
  "19": "and suddenly there came a mighty great wind out of the South, and smote the four corners of the house: which fell upon thy children, so that they are dead: and I am gotten away alone, to tell thee.",
  "20": "Then Job stood up, and rent his clothes, shaved his head, fell down upon the ground, worshipped,",
  "21": "and said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I turn thither again. The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away, (The Greek and Origen add herunto: As it hath pleased the LORD so is it done.) now blessed be the name of the LORD.",
  "22": "In all these things did Job not offend, nor murmured foolishly against God."
