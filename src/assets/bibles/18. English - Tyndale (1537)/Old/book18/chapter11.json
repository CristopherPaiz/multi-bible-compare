  "1": "Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:",
  "2": "Should not he that maketh many words, be answered? Should he that bableth much, be commended therein?",
  "3": "Should men give ear unto thee only? Thou wilt laugh other men to scorn, and shall nobody mock thee again?",
  "4": "Wilt thou say unto God: The thing that I take in hand is perfect, and I am clean in thy sight?",
  "5": "O that God would speak, and open his lips against thee,",
  "6": "that he might shew thee (out of his secret wisdom) how many fold his law is: then shouldest thou know, that God had forgotten thee, because of thy sins.",
  "7": "Wilt thou find out God with thy seeking? Wilt thou attain to the perfectness of the Almighty?",
  "8": "He is higher than heaven, what wilt thou do? Deeper than hell, how wilt thou then know him?",
  "9": "His length exceedeth the length of the earth, and his breadth the breadth of the sea.",
  "10": "Though he turn all things upside down, close them in, or thrust them together, who dare check him therefore?",
  "11": "For it is he that knoweth the vanity of men: he seeth their wickedness also, should he not then consider it?",

  "13": "If thou hadst now a right heart, and liftest up thine hands toward him:",
  "14": "if thou wouldest put away the wickedness which thou hast in hand, so that no ungodliness dwelt in thy house:",
  "15": "Then mightest thou lift up thy face without shame, then shouldest thou be sure, and have no need to fear.",
  "16": "Then shouldest thou forget thy misery, and think no more upon it, than upon the waters that run by.",
  "17": "Then should thy life be as clear as the noon day, and spring forth as the morning.",
  "18": "Then mightest thou have comforth, in the hope that thou hast: and sleep quietly, when thou art buried.",
  "19": "Then shouldest thou take thy rest, and no man to make thee afraid, yea many one should set much by thee.",
  "20": "As for the eyes of the ungodly, they shall be consumed, and not escape: their hope shall be misery and sorrow of mind."
