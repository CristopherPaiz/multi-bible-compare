  "1": "So Job answered, and said:",
  "2": "Then (no doubt) ye are the men alone, and wisdom shall perish with you.",
  "3": "But I have understanding as well as ye, and am no less than ye. Yea who knoweth not these things?",
  "4": "Thus he that calleth upon God, and whom God heareth, is mocked of his neighbour: the godly and innocent man is laughed to scorn.",
  "5": "Godliness is a light despised in the hearts of the rich, and is set for them to stumble upon.",
  "6": "The houses of robbers are in wealth and prosperity, and they that maliciously meddle against God, dwell without care: yea God giveth all things richly with his hand.",
  "7": "Ask the cattle, and they shall inform thee: the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:",
  "8": "Speak to the earth, and it shall shew thee: Or to the fishes of the sea, and they shall certify thee.",
  "9": "What is he, but he knoweth that the hand of the LORD made all these?",
  "10": "In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all men.",
  "11": "Have not the ears pleasure in hearing, and the mouth in tasting the thing that it eateth?",
  "12": "Among old persons there is wisdom, and among the aged is understanding.",
  "13": "Yea with God is wisdom and strength, it is he that hath counsel and foreknowledge.",
  "14": "If he break down a thing, who can set it up again? If he shut a thing, who will open it?",
  "15": "Behold, if he withhold the waters, they dry up: If he let them go, they destroy the earth.",

  "18": "He lowseth the girdle of kings, and girdleth their loins with a bond.",
  "19": "He leadeth away the Priests in to captivity, and turneth the mighty up side down.",
  "20": "He taketh the verity from out of the mouth, and disappointeth the aged of their wisdom.",
  "21": "He poureth out confusion upon princes, and comforteth them that have been oppressed.",
  "22": "Look what lieth hid in darkness, he declareth it openly: and the very shadow of death bringeth he to light.",
  "23": "He both increaseth the people and destroyeth them: He maketh them to multiply, and driveth them away.",
  "24": "He changeth the heart of the princes and kings of the earth, and disapointeth them: so that they go wandering out of the way,",
  "25": "and grope in the dark without light, staggering to and fro like drunken men."
