  "1": "But now they that are mine inferiors and younger than I, have me in derision: yea even they, whose fathers I would have thought scorn to have set with the dogs of my cattle.",
  "2": "The power and strength of their hands might do me no good, and as for their age, it is spent and past away without any profit.",
  "3": "For very misery and hunger, they went about in the wilderness like wretches and beggars,",
  "4": "plucking up herbs from among the bushes, and the Junipers root was their meat.",
  "5": "And when they were driven forth, men cried after them, as it had been after a thief.",
  "6": "Their dwelling was beside foul brooks, yea in the caves and dens of the earth.",
  "7": "Upon the dry heath went they about crying, and in the broom hills they gathered them together.",
  "8": "They were children of fools and villains, which are dead away from the world.",
  "9": "Now am I their song, and am become their jesting stock:",
  "10": "they abhor me, they flee far from me, and stain my face with spittle,",
  "11": "for the Lord(LORDE) hath opened his quiver, he hath hit me and put a bridle in my mouth.",
  "12": "Upon my right hand they rose together against me, they have hurt my feet, made a way to destroy me,",
  "13": "and my path have they clean marred. It was so easy for them to do me harm, that they needed no man to help them.",
  "14": "They fell upon me, as it had been the breaking in of waters, and came in by heaps to destroy me.",
  "15": "Fearfulness is turned against me. Mine honour vanisheth away more swiftly than wind, and my prosperity departeth hence like as it were a cloud.",
  "16": "Therefore is my mind poured full of heaviness, and the days of trouble have taken hold upon me.",
  "17": "My bones are pierced thorow in the night season, and my sinews take no rest.",
  "18": "With all their power have they changed my garment, and girded me therewith, as it were with a coat.",
  "19": "I am even as it were clay, and am become like ashes and dust.",
  "20": "When I cry unto thee, thou doest not hear me: and though I stand before thee, yet thou regardest me not.",
  "21": "Thou art become mine enemy, and with thy violent hand thou takest part against me.",

  "23": "Sure I am, that thou wilt deliver me unto death: whereas a lodging is prepared for all men living.",
  "24": "Now use not me to do violence unto them, that are destroyed already: but where hurt is done, there use they to help.",
  "25": "Did not I weep in the time of trouble? Had not my soul compassion upon the poor?",
  "26": "Yet nevertheless where as I looked for good, evil happened unto me: and where as I waited for light, there came darkness.",
  "27": "My bowels seeth within me, and take no rest, for the days of my trouble are come upon me.",
  "28": "Meekly and lowly came I in, yea and without any displeasure: I stood up in the congregation, and communed with them.",
  "29": "But now I am a companion of dragons, and a fellow of Ostriches.",
  "30": "My skin upon me is turned to black, and my bones are brent with heat:",
  "31": "my harp is turned to sorrow, and my pipe to weeping."
