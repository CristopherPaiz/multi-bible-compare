  "1": "Is not the life of man upon earth a very battle? Are not his days like the days of an hired servant?",
  "2": "For like as a bond servant desireth the shadow, and as an hireling would fain have an end of his work:",
  "3": "Even so have I laboured whole months long (but in vain) and many a careful night have I told.",
  "4": "When I laid me down to sleep, I said: O when shall I rise? Again, I longed sore for the night. Thus am I full of sorrow, till it be dark.",
  "5": "My flesh is clothed with worms, filthiness and dust: my skin is withered, and crumpled together:",
  "6": "my days pass over more speedily, than a weaver can weave out his web: and are gone, or I am aware.(awarre)",
  "7": "O remember, that my life is but a wind, and that mine eye shall no more see the pleasures thereof,",
  "8": "yea and that none other man's eye shall see me anymore.",
  "9": "For if thou fasten thine eyes upon me, I come to naught like as a cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, even so he that goeth down to hell, cometh no more up,",
  "10": "nor turneth again into his house, neither shall his place know him any more.",
  "11": "Therefore I will not spare my mouth, but will speak in the trouble of my spirit, in that bitterness of my mind will I talk.",
  "12": "Am I a sea, or a whalefish, that thou keepest me so in prison?",
  "13": "When I think: my bed shall comfort me. I shall have some refreshing by talking by myself upon my couch:",
  "14": "Then troublest thou me with dreams, and makest me so afraid thorow visions,",
  "15": "that my soul wisheth rather to be strangled,(hanged) and my bones to be dead.",
  "16": "I can see no remedy, I shall live no more: O spare me then, for my days are but vain.",
  "17": "What is man, that thou hast him in such reputation, and setest so much by him?",
  "18": "Thou takest diligent care for him, and suddenly(sodely) doest thou try him.",
  "19": "Why goest thou not from me, nor letest me alone, so long till I swallow down my spittle?",
  "20": "I have offended, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why hast thou made me to stand in thy way, and am so heavy a burden unto myself?",
  "21": "Why doest thou not forgive my sin? Wherefore takest thou not away my wickedness. Behold, now must I sleep in the dust: And if thou seekest me tomorrow in the morning, I shall be gone."
