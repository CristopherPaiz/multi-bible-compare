  "1": "Job answered, and said:",
  "2": "As for that, I know it is so of a truth, that a man compared unto God, can not be justified.",
  "3": "If he will argue with him, he shall not be able to answer him unto one among a thousand.",
  "4": "He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength. Who ever prospered that took part against him?",
  "5": "He translateth the mountains, or ever they be aware,(awarre) and overthroweth them in his wrath.",
  "6": "He removeth the earth out of her place, that her pillars shake withal.",
  "7": "He commandeth the Son, and it riseth not: he closeth up the stars, as it were under a signet.",
  "8": "He himself alone spreadeth out the heavens, and goeth upon the waves of the sea.",
  "9": "He maketh the vaines(wains) of heaven, the Orions, the seven stars and the secret places of the south.",
  "10": "He doth great things, such as are unsearchable, yea and wonders without number.",
  "11": "If he came by me, I might not look upon him: if he went his way, I should not perceive it.",
  "12": "If he be hasty to take anything away, who will make him restore it again? Who will say unto him: what doest thou?",
  "13": "He is God, whose wrath no man may withstand:(with stode) but the proudest of all must stoop(stoup) under him.",
  "14": "How should I then answer him? or what words should I find out against him?",
  "15": "Yea though I be righteous, yet will I not give him one word again, but meekly submit myself to my judge.",
  "16": "All be it that I call upon him, and he hear me, yet am I not sure, that he hath heard my voice:",
  "17": "he troubleth me so with the tempest, and woundeth me out of measure without a cause.",
  "18": "He will not let my spirit be in rest, but filleth me with bitterness.",
  "19": "If men will speak of strength, he is the strongest of all: if men will speak of righteousness, who dare be my record.",
  "20": "If I will justify my self, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I will put forth my self for a perfect man, he shall prove me a wicked doer:",
  "21": "For that I should be an innocent, my conscience knoweth it not, yea I my self am weary of my life.",
  "22": "This one thing will I say: He destroyeth both the righteous and ungodly.",
  "23": "And though he slay suddenly with the scourge, yet laugheth he at the punishment of the innocent.",
  "24": "As for the world, he giveth it over in to the power of the wicked, such as the rivers be, whereof all lands are full. Is it not so? where is there any, but he is such one?",
  "25": "My days have been more swift than a runner: they are gone suddenly, and have seen no good thing.",
  "26": "They are passed away, as the ships that be good under sail, and as the Aegle that hasteth to the prey.",
  "27": "When I am purposed to forget my complainings, to change my countenance, and to comfort myself:",
  "28": "Then am I afraid of all my works, for I know, thou favourest not an evil doer.",
  "29": "If I be then a wicked one, why have I laboured in vain?",
  "30": "Though I washed my self with snow water, and made mine hands never so clean,",
  "31": "yet shouldest thou dip me in the mire, and mine own clothes should defile me.",
  "32": "For he that I must give answer unto, and with whom I go to law, is not a man as I am.",
  "33": "Neither is there any daysman to reprove both the parts, or to lay his hand betwixt us.",
  "34": "Let him take his rod away from me, yea let him make me no more afraid of him,",
  "35": "and then shall I answer him without any fear. For as long as I am in such fearfulness, I can make no answer: And why?"
