  "1": "Man that is born of a woman, hath but a short time to live, and is full of divers miseries.",
  "2": "He cometh up and falleth away like a flower. He flyeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one state.",
  "3": "Thinkest thou it now well done, to open thine eyes upon such one, and to bring me before thee in judgement?",
  "4": "Who can make it clean, that cometh from an unclean thing? Nobody.",
  "5": "The days of man are short, the number of his months are known only to thee. Thou hast appointed him his bounds, he can not go beyond them.",
  "6": "Go from him, that he may rest a little: until his day come, which he looketh for, like as an hireling doth.",
  "7": "If a tree be cut down, there is some hope yet, that it will sprout and shoot forth the branches again;",
  "8": "For though a root be waxen old and dead in the ground,",
  "9": "yet when the stock geteth the scent of water, it will bud, and bring forth bows, like as when it was first planted.",
  "10": "But as for man, when he is dead, perished and consumed away, what becometh of him?",
  "11": "The floods when they be dried up, and the rivers when they be empty, are filled again thorow the flowing waters of the sea:",
  "12": "but when man sleepeth, he riseth not again, until the heaven perish: he shall not wake up nor rise out of his sleep.",
  "13": "O that thou wouldest keep me, and hide me in the hell, until thy wrath were stilled: and to appoint me a time, wherein thou mightest remember me.",

  "16": "For thou hast numbered all my goings, yet be not thou too extreme upon my sins.",
  "17": "Thou hast sealed up mine offenses, as it were in a bag: but be merciful unto my wickedness.",
  "18": "The mountains fall away at the last, the rocks are removed out of their place,",
  "19": "the waters pierce thorow the very stones by little and little, the floods wash away the gravel and the earth: Even so destroyest thou the hope of man in like manner.",
  "20": "Thou prevailest against him, so that he passeth away: thou changes his estate, and puttest him from thee.",
  "21": "Whether his children come to worship or no, he can not tell: And if they be men of low degree, he knoweth not.",
  "22": "While he liveth, his flesh must have travail: And while the soul is in him, he must be in sorrow."
