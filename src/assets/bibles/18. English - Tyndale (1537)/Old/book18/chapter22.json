  "1": "So Eliphas the Themanite gave answer, and said:",
  "2": "May a man be compared unto God in wisdom, though he seem to himself, for to be like him?",
  "3": "What pleasure hath God in that thou art righteous? Or what doth it profit him, that thy ways are perfect?",
  "4": "Is he afraid to reprove thee, and to step forth with thee in to judgement?",
  "5": "Cometh not this for that(the) great wickedness, and for thine ungracious deeds which are innumerable?",
  "6": "Thou hast taken the pledge from thy brethren for naught, and robbed the naked of their clothing:",
  "7": "To such as were weary, hast thou given no water to drink, thou hast withdrawn bread from the hungry:",
  "8": "Should such one then as useth violence, wrong and oppression (doing all things of partiality, and having respect of persons) dwell in the land?",
  "9": "Thou hast sent widows away empty and oppressed the poor fatherless.",
  "10": "Therefore art thou compassed about with snares on every side, and suddenly vexed with fear.",
  "11": "Shouldest thou then see no darkness? Should not the water flood run over thee?",
  "12": "Now because that God is higher than the heavens, and because thou seest the stars are so high,",
  "13": "wilt thou therefore say: Tush, how should God know? Doth his dominion reach beyond the clouds?",
  "14": "Tush, the clouds cover him that he may not see, for he dwelleth in heaven.",
  "15": "Well, thou wilt keep the old way, that all wicked men have gone:",
  "16": "both old and young, whose foundation is a running water,",
  "17": "which sayeth unto God: go from us, and after this manner: Tush, what will the Almighty do unto us?",
  "18": "where as he (notwithstanding) filleth their houses with all good. Which meaning of the ungodly be far from me.",
  "19": "For with joy shall the godly, and with gladness shall the innocent see,",
  "20": "that their increase shall be hewn down, and their posterity consumed with (the) fire.",
  "21": "Therefore reconcile thee unto God, and be content, so shall all things prosper with thee rightwell.",
  "22": "Receive the law at his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.",
  "23": "For if thou wilt turn to the Almighty, thou shalt stand fast, and all unrighteousness shall be far from thy dwelling:",
  "24": "He shall give thee an harvest, which in plenty and abundance shall exceed the dust of the earth, and the gold of Ophir like river stones.",
  "25": "Yea the Almighty his own self shall be thine harvest, and the heap of thy money.",
  "26": "Then shalt thou have thy delight(delyte) in the Almighty, and lift up thy face unto God.",
  "27": "Then shalt thou make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt keep thy promises.",
  "28": "Then, look what thou takest in hand, he shall make it to prosper with thee, and the light shall shine in thy ways.",
  "29": "For who so humbleth himself, him shall he set up: and who so looketh meekly, shall be healed.",
  "30": "If thou be innocent, he shall save thee: and thorow the unguiltyness of thine hands shalt thou be delivered."
