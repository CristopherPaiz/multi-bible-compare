  "1": "So these three men would strive no more with Job, because he held himself a righteous man.",
  "2": "But Eliu the son of Barachell the Bussite of the kindred of Ram, was very sore displeased at Job, that he called him self just before God.",
  "3": "And with Job's three friends he was angry also, because they had found no reasonable answer to overcome him.",
  "4": "Now tarried Eliu till they had ended their communication with Job, for why? they were elder than he.",
  "5": "So when Eliu the son of Barachell the Bussite saw, that these three men were not able to make Job answer, he was miscontent:",
  "6": "so that he gave answer himself, and said: Considering, that I am young, and ye be men of age, I was afraid, and durst not shew forth my mind,",
  "7": "for I thought thus within myself: It becometh old men to speak, and the aged to teach wisdom.",
  "8": "Every man (no doubt) hath a mind, but it is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding.",
  "9": "All men are not wise, neither doth every aged man understand the thing that is lawful.",
  "10": "Therefore will I speak also (in so far as I may be heard) and will shew you mine opinion.",
  "11": "For when I had waited till ye made an end of your talking, and heard your wisdom, what arguments you made in your communication:",
  "12": "Yea when I had diligently pondered what ye said, I found not one of you that made any good argument against Job, or that directly could make answer unto his words:",
  "13": "Lest ye should praise yourselves, to have found out wisdom: because it is God that hath cast him out, and no man.",
  "14": "Nevertheless, seeing he hath not spoken unto me, therefore will not I answer him as ye have done",
  "15": "(for they where so abashed that they could not make answer, nor speak one word)",
  "16": "but in so much as ye will not speak, standing still like dumb(domme) men, and making no answer:",
  "17": "I have a good hope for my part to shape him an answer, and to shew him my meaning.",
  "18": "For I am full of words, and the spirit that is within me, compelleth me.",
  "19": "Behold I am as the new wine, which hath no vent, and bursteth the new vessels in sunder.",
  "20": "Therefore will I speak, that I may have vent: I will open my lips, and make answer.",
  "21": "I will regard no manner of person, no man will I spare.",
  "22": "For if I would go about to please men, I know not how soon my maker would take me away."
