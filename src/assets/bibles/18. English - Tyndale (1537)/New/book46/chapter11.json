  "1": "Follow me as I do Christ.",
  "2": "I commend you brethren that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances which I gave(even as I delivered them) to you.",
  "3": "I would ye knew(But I certify you) that Christ is the head of every man; and the woman's head is the man; and Christ's(Christes) head is God.(And the man is the womans head. And God is Christes head.)",
  "4": "Every man praying or prophesying having any thing on his head, shameth his head.",
  "5": "Every woman that prayeth or prophesieth bare headed,(uncovered head) dishonesteth her head. For it is even all one, and the very same thing even as though she were shaven.",
  "6": "If the woman be not covered, let her also be shaven.(shorn.) If it be shame for a woman to be shaven or shorn, let her cover her head.",
  "7": "A man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God. The woman is the glory of the man.",
  "8": "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.",
  "9": "Neither was the man created for the woman's sake: but the woman for the man's sake.",
  "10": "For this cause ought the woman to have power in(on) her head, for the angels' sake.(sakes)",
  "11": "Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord.",
  "12": "For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man by the woman: but all is of God.",
  "13": "Judge in yourselves whether it be comely that a woman pray unto God bareheaded.",
  "14": "Or else doth not nature teach you, that it is a shame for a man, if he have long hair:",
  "15": "and a praise to a woman if she have long hair? For her hair is given her to cover her withal.",
  "16": "If there be any man among you that lusteth to strive, let him know that we have no such customs, neither the congregations of God.",
  "17": "This I warn you of, and commend not that ye come together after a worse manner, and not after a better.(not after a better manner but after a worse.)",
  "18": "First of all when ye come together in the congregation, I hear that there is dissension among you: And I partly believe it.",
  "19": "For there must be sects among you, that they which among you are perfect might be known.",
  "20": "When ye come together in one place, a man cannot eat the Lord's supper.",
  "21": "For every man beginneth afore to eat his own supper. And one is hungry, and another is drunken.",
  "22": "Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or else despise ye the congregation of God? and shame them that have not? what shall I say unto you? shall I praise you? in this praise I you not.",
  "23": "That which I gave(I delivered) unto you I received of the Lord. For the Lord Jesus the same night in the which he was betrayed, took bread:",
  "24": "and thanked and brake, and said: Take ye, and eat ye this is my body which is broken for you. This do ye in the remembrance of me.",
  "25": "After the same manner he took the cup when supper was done saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood, this do as oft as ye drink it, in the remembrance of me.",
  "26": "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shall shew the Lord's death, till he come.",
  "27": "Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread, or drink of the cup unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "Let a man therefore examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.",
  "29": "For he that eateth or drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, because he maketh no difference of the Lord's(lordis) body.",
  "30": "For this cause many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.",
  "31": "If we had truly judged ourselves, we should not have been judged.",
  "32": "(But) When we are judged of the Lord we are chastened, because we should not be damned with the world.",
  "33": "Wherefore my brethren, when ye come together(togedder) to eat, tarry one for another.",
  "34": "If any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation. Other things will I set in order when I come."
