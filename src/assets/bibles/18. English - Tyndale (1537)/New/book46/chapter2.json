  "1": "And I brethren when I came to you, came not in gloriousness of(in hye words) words or of wisdom, shewing unto you the testimony of God.(preaching of Christ)",
  "2": "Neither shewed I myself that I knew any thing among you save(save onely) Jesus Christ, even the same that was crucified.",
  "3": "And I was among you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.",
  "4": "And my words, and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom: but in shewing of the spirit and of power,",
  "5": "that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men: but in the power of God.",
  "6": "We speak that which(That we speak of) is wisdom among them that are perfect: not the wisdom of this world neither of the rulers of this world (which goeth to nought,)",
  "7": "but we speak the wisdom of God, which is in secret and lieth hid, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:",
  "8": "which wisdom none of the rulers of the world knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:",
  "9": "but as it is written: The eye hath not seen, and the ear hath not heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.",
  "10": "But God hath opened them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searcheth all things, yea the bottom of God's(Goddes) secrets.(even the deepness of the God head)",
  "11": "For what man knoweth the things of a man: save the spirit of a man which is within him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.",
  "12": "And we have not received the spirit of the world: but the spirit which cometh of God, for to know the things that are given to us of God,",
  "13": "which things also we speak, not in the cunning words of man's wisdom, but with the cunning words of the holy ghost, making spiritual comparisons of spiritual things.(and judge spiritual matters spiritually)",
  "14": "For the natural man perceiveth not the things of the spirit of God: For they are but foolishness unto him. Neither can he perceive them because he is spiritually examined:(can not perceive it: for it must be spiritually discerned)",
  "15": "but he that is spiritual discusseth all things: yet he himself is judged of no man.",
  "16": "For who knoweth the mind of the Lord, other who shall inform him? but we understand the mind of Christ."
