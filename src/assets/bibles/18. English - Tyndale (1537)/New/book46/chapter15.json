  "1": "Brethren as pertaining to the gospel(gospell) which I preached unto you, which ye have also accepted, and in the which ye continue:(stand)",
  "2": "by the which also ye are saved, I do you to wit after what manner I preached unto you, if ye keep it, except ye have believed in vain.",
  "3": "For first of all I delivered unto you that which I received: how that Christ died for our sins, agreeing(according) to the scriptures:",
  "4": "and that he was buried, and that he arose again the third day according to the scriptures:",
  "5": "and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve;",
  "6": "After that he was seen of more than five hundred brethren at once: of which many remain unto this day, and many are fallen asleep.",
  "7": "After that appeared he to James, then to all the apostles.",
  "8": "And last of all he was seen of me, as of one that was born out of due time.",
  "9": "For I am the least of all the apostles, which am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of God:",
  "10": "But by the favour(grace) of God I am that I am. And his favour(grace) which is in me was not in vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all, (yet) not I, but the favour(grace) of God which is with me.",
  "11": "Whether it were I or they, so have we preach, and so have ye believed.",
  "12": "If Christ be preached how that he rose from death:(the dead:) how say some that are among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
  "13": "If there be no rising again(resurrection) of death:(the dead:) then is Christ not risen.",
  "14": "If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also in vain.",
  "15": "Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God. For we have testified against(of) god how that he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up, if it be so that the dead rise not up again.",
  "16": "For if the dead rise not again, then is Christ not risen again.",
  "17": "If it be so that Christ rose not, then is your faith in vain, and yet are ye in your sins.",
  "18": "And (thereto) they which are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.",
  "19": "If in this life only we believe(hope) on Christ, then are we of all men the miserablest.",
  "20": "(But) Now is Christ risen from death,(the dead) and is become the first fruits of them that slept.",
  "21": "For by a man came death, and by a man came resurrection of death.(the dead.)",
  "22": "For as by Adam all die: even so by Christ, shall all be made alive,",
  "23": "and every man in his own order: The first is Christ, then they that are(belong unto) Christ's(Christis) at his coming.(when he commeth)",
  "24": "Then cometh the end, when he hath delivered up the kingdom to God the father, when he hath put down all rule, authority,(and all superiority) and power.",
  "25": "For he must rule(reign) till he have put all his enemies under his feet.",
  "26": "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.",
  "27": "For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest, that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.",
  "28": "When all things are subdued unto him: then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all things.",
  "29": "Other(Either) else what do they which are baptised over the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they (then) baptised over the dead?",
  "30": "(Yea) And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?",
  "31": "by our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesu our Lord, I die daily.",
  "32": "That I have fought with beasts at Ephesus after the manner of men, what advantageth(helpeth) it me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, tomorrow we shall die.",
  "33": "Be not deceived: malicious(evil) speakings corrupt good manners.",
  "34": "Awake truly out of sleep,(right up) and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this unto your rebuke.",
  "35": "But some man will(might) say: how shall the dead arise? with what(what manner of) body shall they come? (in)",
  "36": "Thou fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickened except it die.",
  "37": "And what sowest thou? Thou sowest not that body that shall be: but bare corn (I mean either of wheat, or of some other)",
  "38": "and God giveth it a body at his pleasure, to every seed a several body.(will, and unto every one of the seeds his own body)",
  "39": "All flesh is not one manner of flesh: but there is one manner flesh of men, another manner flesh of beasts, another manner flesh of fishes, and another of birds.",
  "40": "There are celestial(heavenly) bodies, and there are bodies terrestrial:(earthly bodies) But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.(but the heavenly have one glory, and the earthly another)",
  "41": "There is one manner glory(clearness) of the sun, and another glory(clearness) of the moon, an another glory(clearness) of the stars. For one star differeth from another in glory.(for one star excelleth another in clearness)",
  "42": "So is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, and riseth(shall rise) in incorruption.",
  "43": "It is sown in dishonour, and riseth in honour.(glory) It is sown in weakness, and riseth in power.",
  "44": "It is sown a natural body, and riseth a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.",
  "45": "As it is written: The first man Adam was made a living soul: and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit:",
  "46": "but(Howbeit) that is not first which is spiritual: but that which is natural, and then that which is spiritual.",
  "47": "The first man is of the earth, earthy: The second man is from heaven, heavenly.(the second man is the Lorde from heaven.)",
  "48": "As is the earthy, such are they that are earthy: And as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly.",
  "49": "And as we have born the image of the earthy, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly.",
  "50": "This say I brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither doth corruption inherit uncorruption.",
  "51": "Behold I shew a mystery unto you: we shall not all sleep: but we shall all be changed,",
  "52": "and that in a moment,(suddenly) and in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound(time) of the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall blow, and the dead shall rise incorruptible: And we shall be changed.",
  "53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruptibility: and this mortal must put on immortality.",
  "54": "When this corruptible hath put on incorruptibility: and this mortal hath put on immortality: then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is consumed into victory.(then shall the word be fulfilled that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.)",
  "55": "Death where is thy sting? Hell where is thy victory?",
  "56": "The sting of death is sin. (:and) The strength of sin is the law:",
  "57": "But thanks be unto God, which hath given us victory thorow our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "58": "Therefore my dear brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable, always rich in the works of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know how that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
