  "1": "Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord.",
  "2": "If I be not an apostle unto other, yet am I unto you. For the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.",
  "3": "Mine answer to them that ask me, is this:",
  "4": "Have we not power to eat and to drink?",
  "5": "Either have we not power to lead about a sister to wife as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",
  "6": "Either only I and Barnabas have not power this to do?",
  "7": "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own cost?(upon his own wages?) who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit?(fruit thereof?) or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk?",
  "8": "Say I these things after the manner of men? or sayth not the law the same also?",
  "9": "For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shall not muzzle(mosell) the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take thought for oxen?",
  "10": "Either(Or) saith he it not all together for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written: that he which eareth should ear in(upon) hope: and that he which thresheth in(upon) hope, should(that he might) be partaker of his hope.",
  "11": "If we sow unto you spiritual things: is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?",
  "12": "If other be partakers of this power over you? wherefore are not we rather. Nevertheless we have not used this power: but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel(gospell) of Christ.",
  "13": "Do ye not understand how that they which minister in the temple: have their finding(living) of the temple? And they which wait at the altar are partakers with(enjoy) the altar?",
  "14": "Even so also did the Lord ordain, that they which preach the gospel,(gospell) should live of the gospel:(gospell)",
  "15": "But I have used none of these things. Neither wrote I these things that it should be so done unto me.(For) It were better for me to die than any man should take this rejoicing from me.",
  "16": "In that I preach the gospel(gospell) I have nothing to rejoice of.(I need not boast my self) For necessity is put unto me.(for I must needs do it) Woe is it unto me if I preach not the gospel.(gospell)",
  "17": "If I do it with a good will, I have a reward.(But) If I do it against my will, an office is committed unto me.",
  "18": "What is my reward then? Verily that when I preach the gospel,(gospell) I make the gospel(gospell) of Christ free, that I misuse not mine authority(abuse not my liberty) in the gospel.",
  "19": "For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all men, that I might win the more.",
  "20": "And unto the jews, I became as a jew, to win the jews. To them that were under the law, was I made as though I had been under the law, to win them that were under the law. (when I was not under the law)",
  "21": "To them that were without law, became I as though I had been without law (when I was not without law as pertaining to God, but under a law as concerning Christ) to win them that were without law.",
  "22": "To the weak became I as weak, to win the weak. In all thing I fashioned myself to all men, to save at the leastway some.",
  "23": "And this I do for the Gospel's sake, that I might have my part thereof.",
  "24": "Perceive ye not how that they which run in a course, run all, yet but one receiveth the reward? So run that ye may obtain.",
  "25": "Every man that proveth masteries abstaineth from all things. And they do it to obtain a corruptible crown: but we to obtain an everlasting(uncorruptible) crown:",
  "26": "I therefore so run, not as at an uncertain thing. So fight I, not as one that beateth the air:",
  "27": "but I tame my body and bring him(it) into subjection, lest after that I have preached to other, I myself should be a castaway."
