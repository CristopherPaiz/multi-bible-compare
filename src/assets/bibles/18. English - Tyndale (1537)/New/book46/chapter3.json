  "3": "For ye are yet carnal. As long verily as there is among you envying, strife and dissension: are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men?",
  "4": "As long as one saith: I hold of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not carnal?",
  "5": "What is Paul? what thing is Apollo? but(Only) ministers (are they) by whom ye believed even as the Lord gave every man grace.",
  "6": "I have planted: Apollo watered: but God gave increase.",
  "7": "So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God which gave the increase.",
  "8": "He that planteth, and he that watereth, are neither better than the other. Every man yet shall receive his reward according to his labour.",

  "20": "And again, God knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they be vain.",
  "21": "Therefore let no man rejoice in men. For all things are yours,",
