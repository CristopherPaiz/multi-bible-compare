  "8": "Wherefore if thy hand, or thy foot, give thee an occasion of evil:(offend thee) cut him off, and cast him from thee. It is better for thee to enter in to life halt or maimed, rather than thou shouldest having two hands or two feet, be cast in to everlasting fire.",
  "9": "And if also thine eye offend thee, pluck him out and cast him from thee. It is better for thee, to enter in to life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hellfire.",
  "10": "See that ye despise not one of these little ones. For I say unto you, that in heaven their angels (always) behold the face of my father, which is in heaven.",

  "15": "More over if thy brother trespass against thee. Go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone. If he hear thee, thou hast won thy brother:",
  "16": "But if he hear thee not, then take yet with thee one or two, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, all things may stand.(be established.)",
  "17": "If he hear not them, tell it unto the congregation: if he hear not the congregation, take him as an heathen man, and as a publican.",
  "18": "Verily I say unto you whatsoever ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever ye loose(lowse) on earth, shall be loosed(lowsed) in heaven.",
  "19": "Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree in earth in(upon) any manner thing whatsoever they shall desire: it shall be given them of my father which is in heaven.",
  "20": "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst(myddes) of them.",
  "21": "Then came Peter to him, and said: Master, how oft shall my brother trespass against me, and I shall forgive him?(how oft shall I forgive my brother, if he sin against me) shall I forgive him seven times?",
  "22": "Jesus said unto him: I say not unto thee seven times: but seventy times seven times.",
  "23": "Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain King, which would take accounts of his servants,",
  "24": "and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which ought him ten thousand talents:",
  "25": "but when(whom because) he had nought to pay, the lord(his master) commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children: and all that he had, and payment to be made.",
  "26": "The servant fell down and besought him saying: Sir, give me respite, and I will pay it every whit.",

  "29": "And his fellow fell down, and besought him, saying: have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.",
  "30": "And he would not, but went and cast him in to prison, till he should pay the debt.",
  "31": "When his other fellows saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that had happened.",
  "32": "Then the(his) lord called him, and said unto him. O evil(thou wicked) servant, I forgave thee all that debt, be cause thou praydest me:",
  "33": "Was it not mete also, that thou shouldest have had compassion on thy fellow, even as I had pity on thee?",
  "34": "And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all that was due to him.",
  "35": "So like wise shall your(my) heavenly father do unto you, if ye will not(except ye) forgive with your hearts, each one to his brother their trespasses."
