  "1": "Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went to meet the bridegroom: (and the bride)",
  "2": "five of them were foolish, and five were wise.",

  "7": "Then all those virgins arose, and prepared their lamps.",
  "8": "And the foolish said to the wise: give us of your oil, for our lamps go out?",
  "9": "But the wise answered, saying: not so, lest there be not enough for us and you, but go rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.",
  "10": "In conclusion(And) while they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut up.",
  "11": "Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying: master, master open to us.",
  "12": "But he answered, and said: verily I say unto you: I know you not:",
  "13": "look that ye watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor yet the hour, when the son of man shall come.",
  "14": "Likewise as a certain man ready to take his journey to a strange country, called his servants to him, and delivered to them his goods.",
  "15": "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two and to another one: to every man after his ability, and straight way departed.",
  "16": "Then he that had received the five talents, went and bestowed them,(occupied with the same,) and won other five. (talents)",

  "18": "But he that received (the) one, went and digged a pit in the earth and hid his master's money.",
  "19": "After a long season the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.",
  "20": "Then came he that had received five talents, and brought other five (talents) saying: master, thou deliveredst unto me five talents, lo(behold) I have gained with them five (talents) more.",
  "21": "(Then) His master said unto him: well good servant and faithful; Thou hast been faithful in little, I will make thee ruler over much: enter in into thy master's joy.",
  "22": "Also he that received two talents came, and said: master, thou deliveredest unto me two talents: lo(behold) I have won two other talents with them.",
  "23": "(And) His master said unto him, well good servant and faithful thou hast been faithful in little, I will make thee ruler over much, go in into thy master's joy.",
  "24": "(Then) He which had received the one talent came also, and said: master, I considered that thou wast an hard man, which reapest where thou sowedst not, and gatherest where thou strawedst not,",
  "25": "and was (therefore) afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,(Behold) thou hast thine own.",
  "26": "His master answered, and said unto him: (thou) evil servant and slothful, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I strawed not:",
  "27": "thou oughtest(shouldest) therefore to have had my money to the changers, and then at my coming should I have received my money(mine own) with vantage.",
  "28": "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.",
  "29": "For unto every man that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. And from him that hath not, shall be taken away, even that he hath.",
  "30": "And cast that unprofitable servant into utter darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
  "31": "When the son of man shall come(cometh) in his majesty,(glory) and all his(the) holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty,(glory)",
  "32": "and before him shall be gathered all nations.(people) And he shall sever(separate) them one from another, as a shepherd putteth asunder(divideth) the sheep from the goats.",
  "33": "And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left hand.",
  "34": "Then shall the King say to them on his right hand: Come ye blessed children of my father, inherit ye the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.",
  "35": "For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. I thirsted, and ye gave me drink. I was harborless, and ye lodged me. I was naked and ye clothed me:",
  "36": "I was sick and ye visited me. I was in prison and ye came unto me.",
  "37": "Then shall the just(righteous) answer him saying: master, when, saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or a thirst, and gave thee drink?",
  "38": "when saw we thee harborless, and lodged thee? or naked and clothed thee?",
  "39": "or when saw we thee sick, or in prison and came unto thee?",
  "40": "And the King shall answer and say unto them: verily I say unto you: inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren: ye have done it to me.",
  "41": "Then shall the King say unto them that shall be on the left hand: depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels.",
  "42": "For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat. I thirsted, and ye gave me no drink. I was harborless, and ye lodged me not.",
  "43": "I was naked, and ye clothed me not. I was sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.",
  "44": "Then shall they also answer him saying: master, when saw we thee an hungered, or a thirst, or harborless, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and have not ministered unto thee?",
  "45": "then shall he answer them, and say: Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.",
  "46": "And these shall go into everlasting pain: And the righteous into life eternal."
