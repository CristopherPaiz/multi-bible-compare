  "1": "Take heed to your alms. That ye give it not in the sight of men, to the intent that ye would be seen of them. Or else ye get no reward of your father (which is) in heaven.",

  "5": "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, because they would be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.",
  "6": "But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door to thee, and pray to thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.",
  "7": "But(And) when ye pray, babble not much, as the gentiles(heathen) do: for they think that they shall be heard, for their much babbling's sake.",
  "8": "Be ye not like them therefore. For your father knoweth whereof ye have need, before ye ask of him.",

  "14": "For and if ye shall forgive other men their trespasses, your (heavenly) father in heaven shall also forgive you. (your trespasses)",
  "15": "But and ye will not forgive men their trespasses, no more shall, your father forgive your trespasses.",
  "16": "Moreover when ye fast, be not sad as the hypocrites are. For they disfigure their faces, that it(they) might appear unto men(be seen of men how) that they fast. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.",
  "17": "But thou when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face,",
  "18": "that it appear not unto men how that thou fastest: but unto thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.",
  "19": "(See that ye) Gather not treasure together on(upon the) earth, where rust and moths corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.",
  "20": "But gather ye treasures together in heaven, where neither rust, nor yet moths corrupt: and where thieves neither break up, nor yet steal.",
  "21": "For wheresoever your treasure is, there are your hearts also.(there will your hears be also.)",
  "22": "The light of the body is thine eye. Wherefore if thine eye be single, all thy body is(all body shall be) full of light.",

  "24": "No man can serve two masters. For either he shall hate the one, and love the other: or else he shall lean to the one, and despise that(the) other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.",
  "25": "Therefore I say unto you, be not careful(carefull) for your life what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what raiment ye shall wear.(put on.) Is not the life more worth than meat? and the body more of value than raiment?",
  "26": "Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither reap, nor yet carry into the barns, and yet your heavenly father feedeth them. Are ye not (much) better than they?",
  "27": "Which of you (though he took thought therefore) could put one cubit unto his stature?",
  "28": "And why care ye then for raiment? Behold(Consider) the lilies of the field, how they grow. They labor not, neither spin.",
  "29": "And yet for all that I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his royalty, was not arrayed like unto one of these.",
  "30": "Wherefore if God so clothe the grass, which is today in the field, and tomorrow shall be cast into the furnace: shall he not much more do the same unto you, O ye of little faith?",
  "31": "Therefore take no thought saying: what shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?",
  "32": "(After all these things seek the gentiles) For your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.",
  "33": "But rather seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, and the righteousness thereof, and all these things shall be ministered unto you.",
  "34": "Care not therefore for the day following.(morrow) For the day following(morrow) shall care for itself. Each days trouble is sufficient for the same self day.(Care not therefore then for the morrow, but let the morrow care of itself: for the day present hath ever enough of his own travail.)"
