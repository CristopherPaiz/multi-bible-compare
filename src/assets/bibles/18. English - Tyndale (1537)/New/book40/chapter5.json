  "12": "Rejoice, and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before your days.",
  "13": "Ye are the salt of the earth: but and if the salt be once unsavory,(have lost hir saltiness) what can be salted there with? It is thence forth good for nothing, but to be cast out at the doors, and that men tread it under feet.(and to be trodden under foot of men.)",
  "14": "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill, cannot be hid,",
  "15": "neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it lighteth all them which(that) are in the house.",
  "16": "See that(Let) your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven.",
  "17": "Ye shall not think,(Think not) that I am come to disannul(destroy) the law, other the prophets: no I am not come to disannul(destroy) them, but to fulfil them.",
  "18": "For truly I say unto you, till heaven and earth perish, one jot, or one tittle of the law shall not scape, till all be fulfilled.",

  "20": "For I say unto you except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.",
  "21": "Ye have heard how it was said unto them of the old time: Thou shalt not kill. Whosoever shall kill,(killeth) shall be in danger of judgement.",
  "22": "But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of judgement. Whosoever shall say(sayeth) unto his brother raca, shall be in danger of a council. But whosoever say unto his brother(sayeth) thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.",
  "23": "Therefore when thou offerest thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath anything against thee:",
  "24": "leave there thine offering before the altar, and go thy way first and reconcile thyself(be reconciled) to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.",
  "25": "Agree with thine adversary at once,(quickly) whiles thou art in the way with him, lest thine(that) adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the minister, and then thou be cast into prison.",

  "31": "It is said, whosoever put away his wife, let him give her a testimonial of her(testimony also of the) divorcement.",
  "32": "But I say unto you: whosoever put away his wife, (except it be for fornication) causeth her to break matrimony. And whosoever marrieth her that is divorced, breaketh wedlock.",
  "33": "Again ye have heard, how it was said to them of old time, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform thine oath to God.",
  "34": "But I say unto you swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's seat:(Goddes seat)",
  "35": "nor yet by the earth, for it is his footstool: Neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of that great King:",
  "36": "neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one white hair, or black:",
  "37": "But your communication shall be, yea, yea: nay, nay. For whatsoever is more than that, cometh of evil.",
  "38": "Ye have heard how it is said, an eye for an eye: a tooth for a tooth.",
  "39": "But I say to you, that ye withstand(resist) not wrong. But if a man(whosoever) give thee a blow on thy right cheek, turn to him the other.",
  "40": "And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take (away) thy coat from thee, let him have thy cloak also.",
  "41": "And whosoever will compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.",
  "42": "Give to him that asketh: and from him that would borrow turn not away.",
  "43": "Ye have heard how it is said: thou shalt love thine neighbor, and hate thine enemy.",
  "44": "But I say unto you, love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you. Pray for them which do you wrong, and persecute you,",
  "45": "that ye may be the children of your heavenly father:(that is in heaven:) for he maketh his sun to arise, on the evil, and on the good, and sendeth his rain on the just and unjust.",
  "46": "For if ye shall love them, which love you: what reward shall ye have? Do not the publicans even so?",
  "47": "And if ye be friendly to your brethren only: what singular thing do ye? Do not the publicans likewise?",
  "48": "Ye shall therefore be perfect, even as your heavenly father(which is in heaven) is perfect."
