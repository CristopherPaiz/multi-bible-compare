  "1": "And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain out of the way,",
  "2": "and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his clothes were as white as the light.",
  "3": "And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Helyas talking with him.",
  "4": "Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus: Master here is good being for us. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Helyas.",
  "5": "While he yet spake, behold a bright cloud shadowed them. And lo(behold there came) a voice out of the cloud said:(saying:) This is my dear son, in whom I delight, hear him.",
  "6": "And when the disciples heard that, they fell on their faces, and were sore afraid.",
  "7": "And Jesus came and touched them, and said: Arise and be not afraid.",
  "8": "Then lift they up their eyes, and(And when they looked up, they) saw no man, but(save) Jesus only.(onely.)",
  "9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he(Jesus) charged them saying: See that ye shew this (tell the) vision to no man, til the son of man be risen again from death.",
  "10": "And his disciples asked of him, saying: Why then say the scribes, that Helias must first come?",
  "11": "Jesus answered, and said unto them: Helias shall first come, and restore all things.",
  "12": "And I say unto you, that Helias is come already: And they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they lusted. In likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them.",
  "13": "Then his(the) disciples perceived, that he spake unto them of John baptist.",
  "14": "And when they were come to the people, there came to him a certain man, and kneeled down to him saying:(and said:)",
  "15": "Master have mercy on my son, for he is frantic,(lunatic) and is sore vexed. And ofttimes (he) falleth in to the fire, and oft into the water.",
  "16": "And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.",
  "17": "Jesus answered and said: O generation faithless, and crooked: how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.",
  "18": "And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he came out. (of him) And the child was healed even that same hour.",
  "19": "Then came his(the) disciples(to Jesus) secretly and said: Why could not we cast him out?",
  "20": "Jesus said unto them: Because of your unbelief. For I say verily unto you, if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye should say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and he should remove: Neither should any thing be unpossible for you to do.",
  "21": "But(Howbeit) this kind, goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.",
  "22": "While(As) they passed the time in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men,",
  "23": "and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they sorrowed greatly.",
  "24": "(And) When they were come to Capernaum: They that were wont to gather poll money, came to Peter and said: Doth your Master pay tribute?",
  "25": "He said: Yea. And when he was come into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying: What thinkest thou Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take tribute, or poll money? of their children, or of strangers?",
  "26": "Peter said unto him: Of strangers. Then said Jesus unto him again: Then are the children free.",
  "27": "Nevertheless, lest we should offend them: go to the sea and cast in thine angle, and take the fish that first cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of twelve(twenty) pence that take and pay for me and thee."
