  "1": "For the kingdom of heaven is like unto an householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.",

  "3": "And he went out about the third hour, and saw other standing idle in the market place,",
  "4": "and said unto them: go ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you: and they went their way.",
  "5": "Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.",
  "6": "And he went out about the eleventh hour and found other standing idle, and said unto them: Why stand ye here all the day idle?",
  "7": "They said unto him: Because no man hath hired us. He said to them: go ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoever shall be(is) right, that shall ye receive.",
  "8": "When even was come, the lord of the vineyard, said unto his steward: call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning at the last, till thou come to the first.",
  "9": "And they which were hired about the eleventh hour, came and received every man a penny.",
  "10": "Then came the first, supposing that they should receive more, and they like wise received every man a penny.",
  "11": "And when they had received it, they grudged(murmured) against the good man of the house, saying:",
  "12": "These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day.",
  "13": "He answered to one of them, saying: Friend I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?",
  "14": "Take that which is thy duty, and go thy way. I will give unto this last, as much as to thee.",
  "15": "Is it not lawful for me to do as me listeth, with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?",
  "16": "So the last shall be first, and the first shall be last. For many are called, and few be chosen.",
  "17": "And Jesus ascended(went up) to Jerusalem, and took the twelve disciples apart(aside) in the way, and said to them:",
  "18": "Lo(Behold) we go up to Jerusalem, and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,",
  "19": "and shall deliver him to the gentiles, to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified: and the third day he shall rise again.",
  "20": "Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him,(fell down before him) and desiring a certain thing of him.",
  "21": "(And) He said unto her: What wilt thou have? She said unto him: Grant that these my two sons may sit, (the) one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand in thy kingdom.",
  "22": "Jesus answered, and said: Ye wot not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of? And to be baptised with the baptism, that I shall be baptised with? They answered to him: That we are.",
  "23": "(And) He said unto them: Ye shall drink of my cup, and shall be baptised with the baptism that I shall be baptised with all.(with.) But to sit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give you: but to them for whom it is prepared of my father.",
  "24": "And when the ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren.",
  "25": "But Jesus called them unto him, and said: Ye know, that the lords of the gentiles have domination over them. And they that are great, exercise power over them.",
  "26": "It shall not be so among you: But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister,",
  "27": "and whosoever will be chief, let him be your servant.",
  "28": "Even as the son of man came, not to be ministered(served) unto, but to minister:(to do service) and to give his life for the redemption of many.",
  "29": "And as they departed from Hiericho, much people followed him.",
  "30": "And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard, that Jesus passed by, cried saying: Master the(O LORDE thou) son of David have mercy on us.",
  "31": "And the people rebuffed(rebuked) them, because they should hold their peace: But they cried the more, saying: have mercy on us master which art the(O LORDE thou) son of David.",
  "32": "Then Jesus stood still, and called them, and said: What will ye that I should do to you?",
  "33": "They said unto him: Master, LORDE that our eyes may be opened.",
  "34": "Jesus pitied(had compassion on) them, and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight: And they followed him."
