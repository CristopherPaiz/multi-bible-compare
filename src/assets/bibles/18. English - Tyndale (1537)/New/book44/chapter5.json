  "1": "A certain man named Ananias with Saphira his wife sold a possession,",
  "2": "and kept away part of the price (his wife also being of counsel) and brought a certain part, and laid it down at the apostles' feet.",
  "3": "Then said Peter: Ananias how is it that Satan hath filled thine heart, that thou shouldest lie unto the holy ghost, and keep away part of the price of thy(the) livelihood:",
  "4": "Pertained it not unto thee only? And after it was sold, was not the price in thine own power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.",
  "5": "When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and gave up the ghost. And great fear came on all them that these things heard.",
  "6": "And the young men rose up, and put him apart, and carried him out, and buried him.",
  "7": "(And) It fortuned as it were about the space of three hours after, that his wife came in ignorant of that which was done.",
  "8": "(And) Peter said unto her: Tell me, sold(gave) ye the land for so much? And she said: yea for so much.",
  "9": "(Then) Peter said unto her: why have ye agreed together,(to gether) to tempt the spirit of the Lord? Lo,(Behold) the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out;",
  "10": "Then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost. (And) The young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her by her husband.",
  "11": "And great fear came on all the congregation. And on as many as heard it.",
  "12": "By the hands of the apostles were many signs(tokens) and wonders shewed among the people. And they were all together with one accord in Solomon's hall.(Salomons porch.)",
  "13": "And of other durst no man join himself to them: but(neverthelater) the people magnified them.",
  "14": "The number of them that believed in the Lord both of men and women grew more and more",
  "15": "insomuch that they brought their(the) sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that at the least way the shadow of Peter when he came by, might shadow some of them. (and that they might all be delivered from their infirmities)",
  "16": "There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing with them sick (folks) and them which were vexed with unclean spirits. And they were healed every one.",
  "17": "(Then) The chief priest rose up and (all) they that were with him (which is the sect of the sadducees) and were full of indignation,",
  "18": "and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison:",
  "19": "but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison door,(doors) and brought them forth, and said:",
  "20": "go step forth, and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.",
  "21": "When they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught. The chief priest came and they that were with him and called a council together, and all the seniors(elders) of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to fetch them.",
  "22": "When the ministers came and found them not in the prison, they came again(returned) and told",
  "23": "saying: The prison found we shut with all diligence,(as sure as was possible) and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened we found no man within.",
  "24": "When the chief priest of all and the ruler of the temple, and the high priests heard these things, they doubted of them, whereunto this would grow.",
  "25": "Then came one and shewed them: Lo(behold) the men that ye put in prison stand in the temple, and preach to(teach) the people.",
  "26": "Then went the ruler of the temple with ministers, and brought them without violence. For they feared the people lest they should have been stoned.",
  "27": "And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the chief priest asked them",
  "28": "saying: did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and ye intend to bring this man's blood upon us.",
  "29": "Peter and the other apostles answered, and said: We ought more to obey God than men.",
  "30": "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on tree.",
  "31": "Him being a ruler and a saviour hath God exalted with his right hand,(Him hath God lift up with his right hand, to be a ruler and a saviour) for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.",
  "32": "And we are his records as concerning these things:(records of these words) and also the holy ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.",
  "33": "When they heard that they clave asunder, and sought means to slay them.",
  "34": "Then stood there up one in the council, a pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of law,(scribe) had in authority among(great reputation before) (all) the people and commanded(bade) to put the apostles aside a little space,",
  "35": "and said unto them: Men of Israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.",
  "36": "Before these days rose up one Theudas boasting(boosting) himself, to whom resorted a number of men, about a four hundred, which was slain, and they all which believed(enclined unto) him were scattered abroad, and brought to nought.",
  "37": "After this man arose there up one Judas of Galilee, in the time when tribute began, and drew away much people after him. He also perished: and all even as many as harkened to(they that enclined unto) him are scattered a broad.",
  "38": "And now I say unto you: refrain yourselves from these men, let them alone: For if this(the) counsel or (this) work be of men, it will come to nought:",
  "39": "but and if it be of God, ye cannot destroy it, lest haply ye be found to strive against God.",
  "40": "And to him they agreed, and called the apostles, and beat them, and commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesu, and let them go.",
  "41": "And they departed from the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his name.",
  "42": "And daily in the temple, and in every house they ceased not, teaching and preaching (the Gospell of) Jesus Christ."
