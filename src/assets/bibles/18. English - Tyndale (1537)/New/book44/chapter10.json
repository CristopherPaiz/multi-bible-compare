  "21": "Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius, and said: Lo,(Behold) I am he, whom ye seek, what is the cause wherefore ye are come?",
  "22": "(And) They said unto him: Cornelius the captain a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the people of the jews was warned by an holy angel, to send for thee in to his house, and to hear words of thee.",
  "23": "Then called he them in, and lodged them. (And) On the morrow Peter went (away) with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.",

  "27": "And as he talked with him he came in, and found many that were come together.(to gether)",
  "28": "And he said unto them: Ye do know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to company or come unto an alien:(stranger) But God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean:",
  "29": "therefore came I unto you without scruple,(saying nay) as soon as I was sent for. I ask therefore: for what intent have ye sent for me?",
  "30": "And Cornelius said: This day now four days I fasted, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,",

  "33": "Then sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast well done for to come. Now are we all here, present before God to hear all things that are commanded unto thee of God.",
  "34": "(Then) Peter opened his mouth(mought) and said: Of a truth I perceive, that God is not partial,(God hath no respect of persons)",
