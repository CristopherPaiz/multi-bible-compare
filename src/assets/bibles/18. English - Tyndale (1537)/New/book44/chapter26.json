  "18": "to open their eyes that they might turn from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in me.",
  "19": "Wherefore king Agrippa, I was not disobedient(faithless) unto the heavenly vision:",
  "20": "but shewed first unto them of Damasco, and at Jerusalem, and thorowout all the coasts of Jewry, and to the gentiles, that they should repent, and turn to God, and do the right works of repentance.",
  "21": "For this cause the jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.",
  "22": "Nevertheless I obtained help of God, and stood(continue) unto this day witnessing(and testify) both to small and to great, saying none other things, than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come,",
