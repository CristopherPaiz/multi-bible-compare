  "3": "And he said unto them: wherewith were ye then baptised? And they said: With John's baptism.",
  "4": "Then said Paul: John verily baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him, which should come after him. That is on Christ Jesus.",
  "5": "When they heard that, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesu,(Iesus.)",
  "6": "and when Paul laid his hands upon them, (and) the holy ghost came on them. And they spake with tongues and prophesied;",

  "8": "And he went into the synagogue, and behaved himself boldly for the space of three months, disputing, and giving them exhortations of the kingdom of God.",
  "9": "When divers waxed hard hearted, and believed not, but spake evil of the way of the Lord (,and that) before the multitude: he departed from them; And severed(separated) the disciples away; And taught(disputed) daily in the school of one called Tirannus.",
  "10": "And this continued by the space of two years: So that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesu, both jews and greeks.",
  "11": "And God wrought not small miracles by the hands of Paul.",
  "12": "So that from his body were brought unto the sick, napkins or partlets, and the diseases and evil spirits departed from them.(and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.)",
  "13": "(Then) Certain of the vagabond jews exorcists,(conjurers) took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying: We adjure you by Jesu whom Paul preacheth.",
  "14": "(And) There were seven sons of one Sceva a ruler of the synagogue(a Jew and chief of the priests) which did so:",
  "15": "and the evil spirit answered and said: Jesus I know, and Paul I know: but who are ye?",
  "16": "And the man in whom the wicked devil(evil spirit) was, ran on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the(that) house naked and wounded.",
  "17": "(And) This was known to all the jews and greeks also, which dwelt at Ephesus, and fear came on them all. And they magnified the name of the Lord Jesus.",
  "18": "And many that believed came, and confessed and shewed their works.",
  "19": "Many of them which used curious crafts, brought their books and burned them before all men, and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand silverlings.",
  "20": "So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.",
  "21": "After these things were ended Paul purposed in the spirit, to pass over(take journey thorow) Macedonia and Acaia, and to go to Jerusalem saying: After I have been there I must also see Rome.",
  "22": "So sent he into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him: Timotheus and Erastus: but he himself remained in Asia. For a season.",
  "23": "The same time there arose no little a do about that way.",
  "24": "For a certain man named Demetrius, a goldsmith,(silversmith) which made silver shrines for Diana, was not a little beneficial(small vantage) unto the craftsmen:",
  "25": "which he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said: Sirs ye know that by this craft we have vantage.",
  "26": "Moreover ye see and hear that not alone at Ephesus: but almost thorow out all Asia, this Paul entiseth,(hath persuaded) and turned away much people saying: that they be not gods which are made with hands:",
  "27": "so that not only this our craft cometh into peril to be set at nought: but that also the temple of (the) great (goddess) Diana should be despised. And her majesty(magnificence) should be destroyed, which all Asia, and the world worshippeth.",
  "28": "When they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.",
  "29": "And all the city was on a roar, and they rushed into the common hall(open place) with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarcus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions.",

  "36": "Seeing then that no man saith here against, ye ought to be content, and to do nothing rashly;(without advisement)",
  "37": "For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet despisers(blasphemers) of your goddess.",
  "38": "Wherefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him, have any saying to(ought to say unto) any man, the law is open, and there are rulers, let them accuse one another.",
  "39": "If ye go about any other thing, it may be determined in a lawful congregation.",
  "40": "For we are in jeopardy to be accused of this day's business.(uproar) Forasmuch as there is no cause whereby we may give a reckoning of this concourse of people.(and yet is there no man guilty, of whom we might give a reckoning of this uproar)",
  "41": "And when he had thus spoken, he let the congregation depart."
