  "10": "Jesus answered and said unto her: if thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is, that sayeth to thee give me drink: thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee water of life.",
  "11": "The woman said unto him: Sir thou hast no thing to draw it withal, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that water of life?",
  "12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and he himself drank thereof and his children and his cattle?",

  "21": "Jesus said unto her: woman trust(believe) me; The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the father.",
  "22": "Ye worship ye wot nere(not) what: we know what we worship. For salvation cometh of the jews.",
  "23": "But the hour cometh, and now is, (allready) when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit, and in verity.(trouth) For verily such the father requireth to worship him.",
  "24": "God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must honour(worship) him, in spirit and verity.(trouth, or real fidelity of truth)",

  "27": "And even at that point,(in the mean season) came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said unto him: what meanest(askest) thou, or why talkest thou with her?",
  "28": "The woman (then) left her water pot behind her, and went her way into the city, and said to the men(people) there:",
  "29": "Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did. Is not he Christ?",
  "30": "Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.",
  "31": "(And) In the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying: Master eat.",
  "32": "He said unto them: I have meat to eat, that ye know not of.",
  "33": "Then said the disciples between(among) themselves: hath any man brought him meat?",
  "34": "Jesus said unto them: My meat is to fulfill (do) the will of him that sent me. And to finish his work.",

  "37": "And herein is the saying(proverb) true, that one soweth; And another reapeth.",
  "38": "I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor. Other men laboured; And ye are entered into their labors.",
  "39": "Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him; For the woman's saying, which testified: He told me all things that ever I did.",
  "40": "Then when the Samaritans were come unto him; They besought him, that he would tarry with them. And he abode there two days.",
  "41": "And many more believed because of his own words.",
  "42": "And said unto the woman: Now we believe not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is even indeed(of a truth is) Christ the saviour of the world.",
  "43": "After two days, he departed thence, and went away into Galilee.",
  "44": "And Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath none honour in his own country.",
  "45": "Then as soon as he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him which had seen all (the) things, that he did at Jerusalem on(at) the feast. For they went also unto the feast day.",

  "51": "And anon as he went on his way, his servants met him, and told him, saying: thy child liveth;",
  "52": "Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him: Yesterday the seventh hour, the fever left him.",
