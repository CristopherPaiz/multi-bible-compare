  "21": "Then said the high priests of the jews to Pilate: write not, King of the Jews, but that he said, I am King of the Jews.",

  "33": "(But) When they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:",
  "34": "but one of the soldiers with a spear, thrust him into the side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.",
  "35": "And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true. And he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe also.",
