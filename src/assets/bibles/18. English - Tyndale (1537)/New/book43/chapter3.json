  "1": "There was a man of the pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler among the jews.",
  "2": "He(The same) came to Jesus by night, and said unto him: Master,(Rabbi) we know that thou art, a teacher which art come from God. For no man could do such miracles(these tokens) as thou doest, except God were with him:",
  "3": "Jesus answered, and said unto him: Verily, verily I say unto thee: except a man be born a new, he cannot see the kingdom of God.",
  "4": "Nicodemus said unto him: how can a man be born, when he is old? can he enter into his mother's body(womb) and be born again?",
  "5": "Jesus answered: verily, verily I say unto thee: except that a man be born of water, and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
  "6": "That which is born of the flesh, is flesh. And that which is born of the spirit, is spirit.",
  "7": "Marvel not that I said to thee, ye must be born a new.",
  "8": "The wind bloweth where he listeth, and thou hearest his sound: but canst not tell whence he cometh and whither he goeth. So is every man that is born of the spirit.",
  "9": "And Nicodemus answered and said unto him: how can these things be?",
  "10": "Jesus answered and said unto him: Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?",
  "11": "Verily, verily I say unto thee, we speak that we know, and testify that we have seen: And ye receive not our witness.",
  "12": "If I have told(when I tell) you earthly things and ye have not believe: How should ye believe if I shall tell you of heavenly things?",
  "13": "And no man ascendeth up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, that is to say, the son of man which is in heaven.",
  "14": "And as Moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lift up,",
  "15": "that none which(that) believeth in him perish: but have eternal life.",
  "16": "(For) God so loved(loveth) the world, that he gave(hath given) his only son for the intent, that none that believe in him, should perish: But should have everlasting life.",
  "17": "For God sent not his son into the world, to condemn the world: But that the world through him, might be saved.(might be saved by him)",
  "18": "He that believeth on him shall not be condemned. But he that believeth not, is condemned all ready, because he believeth not in the name of the only son of God.",
  "19": "And this is the condemnation: (that) Light is come into the world, and the men have loved darkness more than light, because their deeds were evil.",
  "20": "For every man that evil doeth, hateth the light: neither cometh to light, lest his deeds should be reproved.",
  "21": "But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds might be known, how that they are wrought(done) in God.",
  "22": "After that(these things) came Jesus and his disciples into the jews' land, and there abode(he haunted) with them and baptised,",
  "23": "and John also baptised in Enon besides Salim, because there was much water there, and they came, and were baptised.",
  "24": "For John was not yet cast into prison.",
  "25": "(And) There arose a question between John's disciples and the jews about purifying.",
  "26": "And they came unto John, and said unto him: Master,(Rabbi) behold he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness,(belhold the same) baptiseth, and all men come to him.",
  "27": "John answered, and said: A man can receive nothing at all except it be given him from heaven.",
  "28": "Ye yourselves are witnesses, how that I said: I am not Christ: but am sent before him.",
  "29": "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: But the friend of the bridegroom which standeth by and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this my joy is fulfilled.",
  "30": "He must increase: and I must decrease.",
  "31": "He that cometh from on high is above all: he that is of the earth is of(off) the earth,(earthly) and speaketh of the earth. He that cometh from heaven, is above all:",
  "32": "And testifieth that he hath seen, and heard: and his testimony no man receiveth.(and what he hath seen and heard: that he testifieth: but no man receiveth his testimony.)",
  "33": "Whosoever receiveth his witness, the same hath sealed that God is true.(How be it, he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.)",
  "34": "For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God. For God giveth not the spirit by measure.",
  "35": "The father loveth the son, and hath given all things into his hand.",
  "36": "He that believeth on the son, hath everlasting life. And he that beloveth(believeth) not the son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him."
