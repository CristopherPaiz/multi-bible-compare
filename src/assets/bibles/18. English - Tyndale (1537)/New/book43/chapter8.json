  "1": "(And) Jesus went unto mount olivet,",
  "2": "and early in the morning came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; And he sat down, and taught them.",
  "3": "(And) The scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in advoutry, and set her in the midst and said unto him:",
  "4": "Master this woman was taken in advoutry, even as the deed was a doing.",
  "5": "Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned: What sayest thou therefore?",
  "6": "And this they said to tempt him: that they might have, whereof to accuse him. Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.",
  "7": "And while they continued asking him, he lifted himself up; And said unto them: let him that is among you without sin, cast the first stone at her.",
  "8": "And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.",
  "9": "(And) As soon as they heard that, they went out one by one the eldest first. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.",
  "10": "When Jesus had lifted up himself again, and saw no man, but the woman; He said unto her: Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?",
  "11": "She said: Sir no man.(No man Lorde.) (And) Jesus said: Neither do I condemn thee. Go hence and sin no more.",
  "12": "Then spake Jesus again unto them saying: I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness: but shall have the light of life.",
  "13": "The pharisees said unto him: thou bearest record of thyself, thy record is not true.",
  "14": "Jesus answered and said unto them: And if(Though) I bear record of myself, (yet) my record is true for I know whence I come,(came) and whither I go. (But) Ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.",
  "15": "Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man,",
  "16": "and if(though) I judge, then(yet) is my judgement true. For I am not alone: but I and my(the) father that sent me.",
  "17": "It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.",
  "18": "I am one that bear witness of myself, and my(the) father that sent me beareth witness of me.",
  "19": "Then said they unto him: where is thy father? Jesus answered: ye neither know me, nor yet my father. If ye had known me, ye should have known my father also.",
  "20": "These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. And no man laid hands on him; For his time was not yet come.",
  "21": "Then said Jesus again unto them: I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins. Whither I go thither can ye not come.",
  "22": "Then spake(said) the jews: will he kill himself, because he saith: whither I go, thither can ye not come?",
  "23": "And he said unto them: ye are from beneath, I am from above. Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.",
  "24": "I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins. For except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.",
  "25": "Then said they unto him, who art thou? And Jesus said unto them: Even the very same thing that I say unto you.",
  "26": "I have many things to say, and to judge of you. But(Ye and) he that sent me is true. And I speak in the world, those things which I have heard of him.",
  "27": "(Howbeit) They understood not that he spake of his father.",
  "28": "Then said Jesus unto them: When ye have lift up on high(an hye) the son of man then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; But as my father hath taught me, even so I speak.",
  "29": "And he that sent me is with me. My(the) father hath not left me alone; For I do always those things that please him.",
  "30": "As he spake these words, many believed on him.",
  "31": "Then said Jesus to those jews which believed on him: If ye continue in my saying,(words) then are ye my very disciples:",
  "32": "and ye shall know the truth: And the truth shall make you free.",
  "33": "They answered him: We be Abraham's seed, and were never bond to any man: why sayest thou then, ye shall be made free?",
  "34": "Jesus answered them: verily, verily I say unto you, that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.",
  "35": "And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: But the son abideth ever.",
  "36": "If the son therefore shall make you free, then are ye free in deed.",
  "37": "I know that ye are Abraham's seed: but ye seek means to kill me because my sayings have no place in you.",
  "38": "I speak that I have seen with my father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.",
  "39": "They answered and said unto him: Abraham is our father. Jesus said unto them. If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the deeds of Abraham.",
  "40": "But now ye go about to kill me, a man that have told you the truth, which I have heard of my father.(God:) This did not Abraham.",
  "41": "Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they unto him: we were not born of fornication. We have one father that(which) is God.",
  "42": "Jesus said unto them: if God were your father, then would ye have loved me. For I proceeded forth and come from God. Neither came I of myself, but he sent me.",
  "43": "Why do ye not know my speech? (Even) Because ye cannot abide the hearing of my words.",
  "44": "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father, ye will follow:(do.) He was a murderer from the beginning; And abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, then speaketh he of his own. For he is a liar, and the father thereof.",
  "45": "And because I tell you the truth, therefore believe ye not me.(therefore ye believe me not.)",
  "46": "Which of you can rebuke me of sin? If I say the truth, why do not ye believe me?",
  "47": "He that is of God, heareth God's(goddes) words. Ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.",
  "48": "Then answered the jews and said unto him: Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast the devil?",
  "49": "Jesus answered: I have not the devil: but I honour my father, and ye have dishonored me.",
  "50": "I seek not mine own praise: (but) There is one that seeketh it and judgeth.",
  "51": "Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my sayings, he shall never see death.",
  "52": "Then said the jews to him: Now know we that thou hast the devil. Abraham is dead, and also the prophets, and yet thou sayest: if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death.",
  "53": "Art thou greater than our father Abraham? which is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom makest thou thyself?",
  "54": "Jesus answered: If I praise(honour) myself, mine praise(honour) is nothing worth. It is my father that praiseth(honoureth) me, which ye say is your God.",
  "55": "And yet have ye not known him: but I know him.(your God, and ye have not known him:) And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like unto you; But I know him, and keep his saying.(word)",
  "56": "Your father Abraham was glad to see my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.",
  "57": "Then said the jews unto him: Thou art not yet fifty year old, and hast thou seen Abraham?",
  "58": "Jesus said unto them: Verily, verily I say unto you: yer Abraham was I am.",
  "59": "Then took they up stones, to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple."
