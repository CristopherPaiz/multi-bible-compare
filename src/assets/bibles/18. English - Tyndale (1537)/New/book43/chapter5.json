  "1": "After that there was a feast of the jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
  "2": "(And) There is at Jerusalem, by the slaughterhouse a pool called in the Hebrew tongue, bethesda, having five porches,",
  "3": "in them(which) lay a great multitude of sick folk, of blind, halt,(lame) and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.",
  "4": "For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and stirred(troubled) the water. Whosoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.",
  "5": "And a certain man was there, which had been diseased thirty eight years.",
  "6": "When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he now long time had been diseased, he said unto him: Wilt thou be (made) whole?",
  "7": "The sick answered him: Sir I have no man when the water is moved,(troubled) to put me into the pool. But in the mean time, while I am about to come, another steppeth down before me.",
  "8": "(And) Jesus said unto him: rise, take up thy bed, and walk.",
  "9": "And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and went. And the same day was the Sabbath day.",
  "10": "The jews therefore said unto him that was made whole: It is the Sabbath day, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.",
  "11": "He answered them: he that made me whole, said unto me: Take up thy bed, and get thee hence.(go thy way)",
  "12": "Then asked they him: what man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed and walk?",
  "13": "And he that was healed, wist not who it was. For Jesus had gotten himself away, because that there was press of people in the place.",
  "14": "(And) After that, Jesus found him in the temple, and said unto him: Behold thou art made whole, see thou sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.",
  "15": "The man departed, and told the jews that it was Jesus, the which had made him whole.",
  "16": "And therefore the jews did persecute Jesus, and sought the means to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.",
  "17": "(And) Jesus answered them: My father worketh hitherto, and I work.",
  "18": "Therefore the jews sought the more to kill(slay) him, not only because he had broken the Sabbath: but said also that God was his father and made himself equal with God.",
  "19": "Then answered Jesus and said unto them: verily, verily, I say unto you: the son can do no thing of himself: but that he seeth the father do. For whatsoever he doeth, that doeth the son also.",
  "20": "For the father loveth the son, and sheweth him all things, whatsoever he himself doeth. And he will shew him greater works than these, because ye should marvel.",
  "21": "For likewise as the father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the son quickeneth whom he will.",
  "22": "Neither judgeth the father any man: but hath committed(hath given) all judgement unto the son,",
  "23": "because that all men should honour the son, even as they honour the father. He that honoureth not the son, the same honoureth not the father which hath sent him.",
  "24": "Verily, verily I say unto you: He that heareth my words; And believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into damnation: but is scaped from death unto life.",
  "25": "Verily, verily I say unto you: the time shall come, and now is, (allready) when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God. And they that hear, shall live.",
  "26": "For as the father hath life in himself, so likewise hath he given to the son to have life in himself.",
  "27": "And hath given him power also to judge in that he is the son of man.",
  "28": "Marvel not at this, that the hour shall come, in the which all that are in the graves, shall hear his voice,",
  "29": "and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life. And they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.",
  "30": "I can of mine own self do nothing at all. As I hear I judge, and my judgement is just, because I seek not mine own will: But the will of the father which hath sent me.",
  "31": "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.",
  "32": "There is another that beareth witness of me. And I am sure that the witness which he beareth of me is true.",
  "33": "Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth:",
  "34": "but I receive no(not the) record of man. Nevertheless, these things I say, that ye might be safe.",
  "35": "He was a burning, and a shining light, and ye would for a season have rejoiced in his light.",
  "36": "But I have greater witness, than the witness of John. For the works which my(the) father hath given me to finish: the same works which(that) I do, bear witness of me, that my(the) father sent me.",
  "37": "And my(the) father himself,(him self) which hath sent me, beareth witness of me. Ye have not heard his voice at any time; Nor yet(ye) have seen his shape.(hysshape)",
  "38": "And(thereto) his words have ye not abiding in you: For ye believe not him whom he hath sent.(For whom he hath sent: him ye believe not.)",
  "39": "Search the scriptures, for in them, ye think ye have eternal life: And they are they which testify of me.",
  "40": "And yet will ye not come to me that ye might have life.",
  "41": "I receive not praise of men:",
  "42": "But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.",
  "43": "I am come in my father's name, and ye receive me not. If another shall come in his own name, him will ye receive.",
  "44": "How can ye believe, which receive praise(honour) one of another, and seek not the praise which(honour that) cometh of God only?",
  "45": "Suppose not,(Do not think) that I will accuse you to my father. There is one that accuseth you, verily(even) Moses in whom ye trust.",
  "46": "For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: For he wrote of me.",
  "47": "But when(seeing) ye believe not his writing: how shall ye believe my words."
