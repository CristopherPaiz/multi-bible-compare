  "1": "Because therefore that we are justified by faith we are at peace with God thorow our Lord Jesus Christ:",
  "2": "by whom we have a way in thorow(an entrance in) faith unto this favour(grace) wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the praise that shall be given (of the children) of God.",
  "3": "Neither do we so only: but also we rejoice in tribulation: For we know that tribulation bringeth patience,",
  "4": "patience bringeth fealing, fealing(experience, experience) bringeth hope.",
  "5": "And hope maketh not ashamed,(is letteth us not come to confusion) because the love that God hath unto us,(for the love of God) is shed abroad in our hearts, by the holy ghost, which is given unto us.",
  "6": "For when we were yet weak according to the time: Christ died for us which were ungodly.",
  "7": "Yet scarce will any man die for a righteous man. Peradventure for a good man durst a man die.",
  "8": "But God setteth out his love that he hath to us; Seeing that while we were yet sinners; (according to the time) Christ died for us.",
  "9": "Much more then now (seeing we are justified(made righteous) in his blood) shall we be preserved(saved) from wrath thorow him.",

  "16": "And the gift is not over one sin, as death came thorow one sin of one that sinned. For damnation(the judgement) came of one sin unto condemnation: But the gift came to justify from many sins.",
  "17": "For if by the sin of one, death reigned by the means of one, much more shall they which receive abundance of favour(grace) and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by the means of one (that is to say) Jesus Christe.",
  "18": "Likewise then as by the sin of one, condemnation came on all men: even so by the justifying of one cometh the righteousness that bringeth life, upon all men.",
  "19": "For as by one man's disobedience many became sinners: so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.",
  "20": "(But) The law in the mean time entered in that sin should increase. And(Neverthelater) where abundance of sin was, there was more plenteousness of grace.",
  "21": "That as sin had reigned unto death, even so might grace reign thorow righteousness unto eternal life, by the help(means) of Jesu(Iesu) Christ."
