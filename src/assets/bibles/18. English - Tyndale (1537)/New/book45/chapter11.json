  "5": "Even so at this time is there a remnant left thorow the election of grace.",
  "6": "If it be of grace then is it not by the deserving of works.(then is it not of works) For then were favour(grace) no more favour.(grace.) If it be by the deserving of works, then is there no favour.(is it no more grace.) For then were deserving no (longer) deserving.",
  "7": "What then? Israel hath not obtained that that he sought. No but yet the election hath obtained it. The remnant are blinded,(As for the other, they are blinded)",
  "8": "according as it is written: God hath given them the spirit of unquietness: eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, even unto this day.",
  "9": "And David saith: Let their table be made a snare to take them withal, and an occasion to fall, and a reward unto them.",
  "10": "Let their eyes be blinded that they see not: and ever bow down their backs.",

  "13": "I speak to you gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the gentiles I will magnify mine office",

  "19": "Thou wilt say then: the branches are broken off, that I might be graft in.",
  "20": "Thou sayest well: because of unbelief they are broken off, and thou standest steadfast in faith.(thorow belief) Be not high minded, but fear:",
