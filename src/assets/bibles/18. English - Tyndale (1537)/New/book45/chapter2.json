  "1": "Therefore art thou inexcusable O man whosoever thou be that judgest. For in the same wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou that judgest doest even the same self things.",
  "2": "But we are sure that the judgement of God is according to truth, against them which commit such things.",
  "3": "Thinkest thou (this) O thou man that judgest them which do such things and yet doest even the very same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?",
  "4": "Other(Either) despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience, and long sufferance? and rememberest not how that the kindness of God leadeth thee to repentance?",
  "5": "But thou after thine hard heart that cannot repent, heapest thee together the treasure of wrath against the day of vengeance,(wrath) when shall be opened the righteous judgement of God,",
  "6": "which will reward every man according to his deeds,",
  "7": "that is to say praise, honour, and immortality,(uncorruption) to them which continue(with patience) in good doing, and seek eternal life:",
  "8": "But unto them that are rebellious, and disobey the truth, yet(and) follow iniquity,(are contentious and not obedient unto the truth, but obey unrighteousness) shall come indignation, and wrath,",
  "9": "tribulation(trouble) and anguish upon the soul of every man that doth evil. Of the jew first: And also of the gentile.",
  "10": "To every man that doth good shall come praise, honour and peace, to the jew first, and also to the gentile.",
  "11": "For there is no partiality with God:(there is no respect of persons before God)",
  "12": "But whosoever hath sinned without law, shall perish without law. And as many as have sinned under the law, shall be judged by the law.",
  "13": "For before God they are not righteous which hear the law: but they which do(doers of) the law shall be justified.",
  "14": "For if the gentiles which have no law, do of nature the things contained in the law: then they having no law, are a law unto themselves,",
  "15": "which shew the deed(work) of the law written in their hearts: While their conscience beareth witness unto them, and also their thoughts, accusing one another, or excusing",
  "16": "at the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ according to my Gospell.",
  "17": "Behold, thou art called a jew, and trustest in the law and rejoicest in(makest thy boast of) God,",
  "18": "and knowest his will, and hast experience of good and bad, in that thou art informed by the law:",
  "19": "And believest that thou thyself art a guide unto the blind,(thou provest what is best to do, and presumest to be a leader of the blind) a light to them which are in darkness,",
  "20": "an informer of them which lack discretion,(the unwise) a teacher of the unlearned,(simple) which hast the ensample of that which ought to be known,(ensample of knowledge) and of the truth in the law.",
  "21": "Now teachest thou another: but teachest not thyself.(But thou which teachest another, teachest not thyself.) Thou preachest, a man should not steal: and yet thou stealest.",

  "23": "Thou abhorrest images, and robbest God of his honour. Thou rejoicest in(makest thy boast of) the law, and thorow breaking the law dishonourest God.",
  "24": "For the name of God is evil spoken of among the gentiles thorow you as it is written.",
  "25": "Circumcision verily availeth if thou keep the law: But if thou break the law thy circumcision is made(become) uncircumcision.",
  "26": "Therefore if the uncircumcised keep the right things contained in the law: shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?",
  "27": "And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature (if it keep the law)(and fulfilleth the law) judge thee, which being under the letter and circumcision, dost transgress the law?",
  "28": "For he is not a jew, which is a jew outward. Neither is that thing circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:",
  "29": "But he is a Jew which is hid within, and the circumcision of the heart is the true circumcision, which is in the spirit, and not in the letter: whose praise is not of men but of God."
