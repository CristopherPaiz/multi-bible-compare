  "1": "There is then no damnation to them which are in Christ Jesu, which walk not after the flesh: but after the spirit.",
  "2": "For the law of the spirit, wherein is(that bringeth) life thorow Jesus Christ hath delivered me(made me free) from the law of sin, and death.",
  "3": "For what the law could not do inasmuch as it was weak because of the flesh: that performed God, and sent his son in the similitude of sinful flesh, and by sin damned sin in the flesh:",
  "4": "that the righteousness required of the law, might be fulfilled in us, which walk not after the flesh: but after the spirit.",
  "5": "For they that are carnal, are carnally minded; and(But) they that are spiritual are ghostly minded.",
  "6": "To be carnally minded is death; and(But) to be spiritually minded is life, and peace:",
  "7": "because that the fleshly mind is enmity against God: For it is not obedient to(subdued unto) the law of God, neither can be.",
  "8": "So then they that are given to the flesh, cannot please God.",
  "9": "But ye are not given to the flesh; But to the spirit: If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. If there be any man that hath not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his.",
  "10": "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin: But the spirit is life for righteousness' sake.",
  "11": "Wherefore if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from death, dwell in you: even he that raised up Christ from death, shall quicken your mortal bodies, be cause that his(this) spirit dwelleth in you.",
  "12": "Therefore brethren we are now debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:",
  "13": "For if ye live after the flesh, ye must die. But if ye mortify the deeds of the body, by the help of the spirit, ye shall live,",
  "14": "for as many as are led by the spirit of God, (:they) are the sons of God.",
  "15": "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage to fear any more, but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba father.(Abba, dear father)",
  "16": "The same spirit certifieth our spirit that we are the sons of God.",
  "17": "If we be sons, we are also heirs (the heirs I mean of God) and heirs annexed with Christ, if so be that we suffer together, that we may be glorified together.",
  "18": "For I suppose that the afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed upon us.",
  "19": "Also the fervent desire(longing) of the creatures abideth looking when the sons of God shall appear",
  "20": "because the creatures are subdued to vanity against their will: but for his will which subdued(subdueth) them in hope.",
  "21": "For the very creatures shall be delivered(free) from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.(children of God)",
  "22": "For we know that every creature groaneth with us also, and travaileth in pain even unto this time.",
  "23": "Not they only, but even we also which have the first fruits of the spirit mourn(groan) in ourselves and wait for the adoption (of the children God) and look for the deliverance of our bodies.",
  "24": "For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is no hope. For how can a man hope for that which he seeth?",
  "25": "but and if we hope for that we see not, then do we with(thorow) patience abide for it.",
  "26": "Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For we know not, what to desire as we ought: but the spirit maketh intercession mightily for us with groanings which cannot be expressed with tongue.",
  "27": "And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the meaning(mind) of the spirit: for he maketh intercession for the saints according to the pleasure of God.",
  "28": "For we know well that all things work(serve) for the best unto them that love God, which also are called of purpose.",
  "29": "For those which he knew before, he also ordained before, that they should be like fashioned unto the shape of his son, that he might be the first begotten son among many brethren.",
  "30": "Moreover which he appointed(ordained) before, them he also called; and which he called, them also he justified; which he justified,(made righteous) them he also glorified.",
  "31": "What shall we then say unto these things? if God be on our side: who can be against us?",
  "32": "which spared not his own son, but gave him for us all: How shall he not with him give us all things also?",
  "33": "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's(goddes) chosen? It is God that justifieth:(maketh righteous)",
  "34": "who then shall condemn? it is Christ which is dead; Yea rather which is risen again, which is also on the right hand of God and maketh intercession for us.",
  "35": "Who shall separate us from God's love?(the love of god) shall tribulation? or anguish? or persecution, other hunger? other nakedness? other peril? other sword?",
  "36": "As it is written: For thy sake are we killed all day long, and are counted as sheep appointed to be slain.",
  "37": "Nevertheless in all these things we overcome strongly thorow his help that loved us.",
  "38": "Yea and I am sure that neither death, neither life, neither angel,(angels) nor rule, neither power, neither things present, neither things to come,",
  "39": "neither height, neither lowth, neither any other creature shall be able to depart us from God's love,(the love of God) which is(shewed) in Christ Jesu our Lord."
