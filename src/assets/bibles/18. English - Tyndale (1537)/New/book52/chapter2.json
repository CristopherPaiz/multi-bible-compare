  "3": "Our exhortation was not to bring you to error, nor yet to uncleanness, neither was it with guile:",

  "5": "Neither was our conversation at any time with flattering words (as ye well know) neither in cloaked covetousness,(nor waited for our own profit) God is record:",
  "6": "neither sought we praise of men, neither of you, nor yet of any other,(wother) when we might have been chargeable, as the apostles of Christ:",
