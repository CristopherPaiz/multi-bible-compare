  "3": "that no man should be moved in these afflictions.(troubles) For ye yourselves know that we are even appointed thereunto.",

  "5": "For this cause, when(seeing) I could no longer forbear, I sent that I might have knowledge of your faith, lest haply the tempter had tempted you, and that our labour had been bestowed in vain.",

  "13": "to stablish(make) your hearts that they might be without ought to be complained on,(stable and unblamable) in holiness before God our father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints."
