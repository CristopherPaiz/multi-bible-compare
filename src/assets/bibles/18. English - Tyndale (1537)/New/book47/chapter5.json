  "1": "We know surely if our earthy mansion wherein we now dwell(house of this dwelling) were destroyed, that we have a building ordained of God, an habitation not made with hands, but eternal in heaven:",
  "2": "And herefore sigh we, desiring to be clothed with our mansion which is from heaven:",
  "3": "(so yet) if it happen that we be found clothed, and not naked.",
  "4": "For as long as we are in this tabernacle, we sigh and are grieved: for we would(had rather) not be unclothed: but would be clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.",
  "5": "He that hath ordained us for this thing, is God: which very same hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit.",
  "6": "(Therefore) We are alway of good cheer, and know well that as long as we are at home(dwell here) in the body we are absent from God.(not at home with the LORDE)",
  "7": "For we walk in faith and see not.(see him not)",
  "8": "Nevertheless we are of good comfort, and had lever to be absent from the body and to be present(at home) with God.(the Lord.)",
  "9": "Wherefore we endeavor ourselves, whether we be at home or from home, to please God.(Wherefore, whether we be at home or from home we endeavor our selves to please him.)",

  "20": "Now then are we messengers in the room of Christ: even as though God did beseech you thorow us:(exhorted by us) So pray we you(We beseek you now therefore) in Christ's(Christes) stead, that ye be at one with God:",
