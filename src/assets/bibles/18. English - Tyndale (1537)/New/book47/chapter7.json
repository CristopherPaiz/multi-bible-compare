  "1": "Seeing that we have such promises dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and grow up to full holiness in the fear of God.",

  "3": "I speak not this to condemn you: for I have shewed you before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.",
  "4": "I am very bold over(toward) you, and rejoice greatly in you.(make much boast of you) I am filled with comfort, my joy exceeding(and am joyous) in all our tribulations.",

  "14": "I am therefore not now ashamed, though I boasted myself to him of you. For as all things which I preached unto you are true, even so is our boasting, that I boasted myself to Titus withal, found true.",
  "15": "And now is his inward affection more abundant toward you, when he remembereth the obedience of every one of you: how with fear and trembling ye received him.",
  "16": "I rejoice that I may be bold over you in all things."
