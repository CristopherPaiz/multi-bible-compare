  "1": "I do you to wit brethren of the grace of God, which is given in the congregations of Macedonia,",
  "2": "how that the abundance of their rejoicing is, that they are tried with much tribulation. And how that their poverty, though it be deep, yet hath followed over, and is be come unto them riches in singleness.(And thereto though they were exceeding poor, yet have they given exceeding richly, and that in singleness.)",
  "3": "For to their powers (I bear them record) yea and beyond their power, they were willing of their own accord,",
  "4": "and prayed us with great instance, that we would receive their benefit, and suffer them to be partakers with other(others) in ministering to the saints.(and fellowship of the handdreaching that is done for the saints)",
  "5": "And this they did, not as we looked for: but gave their own selves first to the Lord, and after unto us by the will of God:",
  "6": "so that we could not but desire Titus to accomplish the same benevolence among you also, even as he had begun.",
  "7": "Now therefore, as ye are rich in all parts, in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all ferventness,(diligence) and in love, which ye have to us: even so see that ye be plenteous in this benevolence.",
  "8": "This say I not as commanding: but because other(others) are so fervent,(diligent) therefore prove I your love, whether it be perfect or no.",
  "9": "Ye know the liberality of our Lord Jesus Christ, which though he were rich, yet for your sakes became poor: that ye thorow his poverty might be made rich.",
  "10": "And I give counsel hereto: For this is expedient(profitable) for you, which began, not to do only: but also to will, a year ago.",
  "11": "Now therefore perform the deed, that as there was in you a readiness(ready mind) to will, even so ye may perform the deed, of that which ye have.",
  "12": "For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.",
  "13": "It is not my mind(not done to the intent) that other be set at ease, and ye brought into cumbrance: but that there be egalness.(but that it be a like) (now at this time,)",
  "14": "Let(that) your abundance succour their lack at this present time of dearth: that their abundance may supply your lack: that there may be equality,",
  "15": "agreeing to that which is written: He that gathered much had never the more abundance, and he that gathered little, had nevertheless.(He that gathered much, had not the more: and he that gathered little, wanted nothing)",
  "16": "Thanks be unto God, which put in the heart of Titus the same good mind(diligence) toward you.",
  "17": "For he accepted our(the) request. Yea rather he was(in deed, yea he was rather) so well willing, that of his own accord came unto you.",
  "18": "We have sent with him that brother whose laud(praise) is in the gospel(gospell) thorowout all the congregations:",
  "19": "and not so only, but is also chosen of the congregations to be a fellow with us in our journey, as concerning this benevolence that is ministered by us unto the praise of the Lord, and to stir up your prompt mind.",
  "20": "And(For) this we eschew that any man should rebuke us in this abundance,(and to beware, lest any man report evil of us because of this plenteousness)(plenteous distribution) that is ministered by us, (to the glory of the lorde)",
  "21": "and(therefore) make provision for honest things, not in the sight of God only,(not onely before the LORDE) but also in the sight of men.(also before men)",
  "22": "We have sent with them a brother of ours whom we have oft times proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent. The great confidence which I have in you(And this have we done in great hope toward you)",
  "23": "hath caused me this to do: partly(whether it be) for Titus' sake which is my fellow, and helper as concerning you: partly because of other(others) which are our brethren, and the messengers(which are Apostles) of the congregations, and the glory(praise) of Christ.",
  "24": "Wherefore shew unto them the proof of your love, and of the rejoicing that we have(and of your boasting) of you, that the congregations may see it.(sight of the congregations)"
