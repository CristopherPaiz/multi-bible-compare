  "1": "It is not expedient for me(It profiteth me nothing) no doubt to rejoice;(boast) Nevertheless I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
  "2": "I know a man in Christ above fourteen years agone (whether he were in the body I cannot tell, or whether he were out of the body I cannot tell; God knoweth) which(the same) was taken up into the third heaven.",
  "3": "And I know the same man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell; God knoweth)",
  "4": "how that he was taken up into paradise, and heard words not to be spoken, which no man can utter.",
  "5": "Of this man will I rejoice, of myself will I not rejoice,(Hereof will I boast, but of myself will I make no boast) except it be of mine infirmities:",
  "6": "and yet though I would rejoice I should not be a fool:(would boast myself, I did not foolishly) for I would say the truth. Nevertheless I spare,(But I refrain my self) lest any man should think of me above that he seeth me to be, or heareth of me.",
  "7": "And lest I should be exalted out of measure thorow the abundance of revelations, there was given unto me of God unquietness of the flesh,(there is a warning given unto my flesh, even) the messenger of Satan to buffet me: because I should not be exalted(not exault my self) out of measure.",
  "8": "For this thing besought I the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me:",
  "9": "and he said unto me: my grace is sufficient for thee. For my strength is made perfect thorow(throu) weakness. Very gladly therefore will I rejoice of my weakness, that the strength of Christ may dwell in me.",
  "10": "Therefore have I delectation(am I content) in infirmities, in rebukes, in need,(necessities) in persecutions, in anguish, for Christ's(Christis) sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.",
  "11": "I am made a fool in boasting myself. Ye have compelled me: I ought to have been commended of you. For in nothing was I inferior unto the chief apostles, though I be nothing,",
  "12": "yet the tokens of an apostle were wrought among you with all patience: with signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.",
  "13": "For what is it wherein ye were inferiors unto other congregations? except it be therein that I was not grievous unto you. Forgive me this wrong done unto you.",
  "14": "Behold now the third time I am ready to come unto you, neither will I(and yet will I not) be grievous(chargeable) unto you. For I seek not yours but you. Also the children ought not to lay up(gather treasure) for the fathers and mothers: but the fathers and mothers for the children.",
  "15": "I will very gladly bestow, and will be bestowed for your souls: though the more I love you, the less I am loved again.",
  "16": "But be it that I grieved you not: nevertheless I was crafty and took you with guile.",
  "17": "Did I pill(Have I defrauded) you by any of them which I sent unto you?",
  "18": "I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother: Did Titus defraud you of any thing? walked we not in one spirit? walked we not in like steps?",
  "19": "Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves? we speak in Christ in the sight of God. But we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying.",
  "20": "For I fear lest it come to pass, that when I come, I shall not find you such as I would: and I shall be found unto you such as ye(I) would not: I fear lest there be found among you lawing,(debate) envying, wrath, strife, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, and debate.(discord.)(uproars)",
  "21": "I fear lest when I come again, God bring me low among you, and I be constrained to bewail many of them which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and fornication,(whoredom) and wantonness which they have committed."
