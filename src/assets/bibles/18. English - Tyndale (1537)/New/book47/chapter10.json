  "1": "I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and softness of Christ, which when I am present among you, am of no reputation, but am bold toward you being absent.",
  "2": "I beseech you that I need not to be bold when I am present (with that same confidence,(to use that boldness) wherewith I am supposed to be bold) against some which repute us as though we walked carnally.(after the flesh)",
  "3": "Nevertheless though we walk compassed with the flesh, yet we war not fleshly.(fight we not after a fleshly manner)",
  "4": "For the weapons of our war are not carnal things,(fleshly) but things mighty in God to cast down strongholds,",
  "5": "wherewith we overthrow imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bring into captivity all understanding to the obedience of Christ,",
  "6": "and are ready to take vengeance on all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.",
  "7": "Look ye on things after the utter appearance. If any man trust in himself that he is Christ's,(Christis) let the same also consider of himself, that as he is Christ's,(Christis) even so are we Christ's.(Christes.)",
  "8": "And though I should boast myself somewhat more of our authority which the Lord hath given us to edify and not to destroy you, it should not be to my shame.",
  "9": "This say I, lest I should seem as though I went about to make you afraid with letters.",
  "10": "For the pistels (saith he) are sore and strong: but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech homely.(rude.)",
  "11": "Let him that is such think on this wise, that as we are in words by letters when we are absent, such are we in deeds when we are present.",
  "12": "For we cannot find in our hearts to make ourselves of the number of them, or to compare ourselves to them, which laud themselves:(For we dare not reckon or compare our selves, unto some that praise them selves) but(nevertheless) while they measure themselves with themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they understand nought.(nothing)",
  "13": "But we will not rejoice(not boast ourselves) above measure: but according to the quantity of the measure which(measure of the rule wherewith) God hath distributed unto us, a measure that reacheth even unto you.",
  "14": "For we stretch not out ourselves beyond measure as though we had not reached unto you. For even unto you have we come with the gospel(gospell) of Christ,",
  "15": "and we boast not ourselves out of measure in other men's labors: yea and we hope; When your faith is increased among you, to be magnified according to our measure more largely:",
  "16": "And to preach the gospel(gospell) in those regions which are beyond you: and not to rejoice of that which is by another man's measure prepared all ready.(already.)",
  "17": "Let him that rejoiceth, rejoice in the Lord.",
  "18": "For he that praiseth himself, is not allowed: but he whom the Lord praiseth."
