  "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick of the palsy, son thy sins are forgiven thee.",
  "6": "(And) There were certain of the scribes sitting, (there) and reasoning in their hearts:",
  "7": "how doth this fellow so blaspheme? Who can forgiven sins, but God only?",
  "8": "And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit, that they so reasoned in themselves, he said unto them: why think ye such things in your hearts?",
  "9": "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, arise, take up thy bed and walk?",
  "10": "That ye may know that the son of man hath power in earth to forgive sins, he spake unto the sick of the palsy:",
  "11": "I say unto thee, arise and take up thy bed, and get thee hence into thine own house.",
  "12": "And by and by he arose, took up his(the) bed, and went forth before them all: insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God saying: we never saw it on this fashion.",

  "15": "And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat at meat also with Jesus and his disciples. For there were many that followed him.",
  "16": "And when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples: how is it, that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?",
  "17": "When Jesus heard that, he said unto them. The whole have no need of the Physician: but the sick. I came to call the sinners to repentance, and not the just.(I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.)",
  "18": "And the disciples of John and of the pharisees did fast, and they(therefore) came and said unto him: Why do the disciples of John and of the pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not.",
  "19": "And Jesus said unto them: can the children of a wedding fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
  "20": "But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast in those days.",
  "21": "Also no man soweth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for then taketh he away the new piece from the old, and so is the rent worse.",
