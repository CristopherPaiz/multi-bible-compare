  "5": "Some fell on a stony ground: where it had not much earth: and by and by sprang up, because it had not depth of earth:",
  "6": "and(but) as soon as the sun was up it caught heat: and because it had not rooting it withered away.",
  "7": "And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, so that it gave no fruit.",
  "8": "And some fell upon good ground: and did yield fruit that sprang and grew: and brought forth some thirty fold, some forty(sixty) fold, and some an hundred fold.",
  "9": "And he said unto them: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",
  "10": "(And) When he was alone, they that were, about him with the twelve asked him of the similitude.",
  "11": "And he said unto them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: But unto them that are without, shall all things be done in similitudes:",
  "12": "that when they see, they shall see, and not discern: and when they hear they shall hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should turn, and their sins should be forgiven them.",
  "13": "And he said unto them: Perceive ye not this similitude. And how ye shall know all similitudes?(how then should ye understand all other similitudes?)",
  "14": "The sower soweth the word.",
  "15": "These be they which(And they that) are by the ways side, where the word is sown, (are they) to whom as soon as they have heard it, cometh (immediately) the devil(satan) and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.",
  "16": "And these also are(And likewise) they that are sown on the stony ground: which when they have heard the word, at once they receive it with joy,(gladness)",
  "17": "yet have no root(rotes) in themselves, and so endure but for a season:(time: and anon) afterward as soon as any trouble or(and) persecution ariseth for the word's sake, anon(immediately) they fall.(are offended)",
  "18": "And these are they that are sown among the thorns, which(are such as) hear the word of God,",
  "19": "and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things enter in, and choke the word, and it is made unfruitful.",
  "20": "And these(those) that were sown in good ground, are they that hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty fold some sixty fold, some an hundred fold.",
  "21": "And he said unto them: is the candle lighted, to be put under a bushel, or under the bord:(table: and) is it not therefore(rather) lighted that it should(to) be put on a candlestick?",
  "22": "For there is nothing so privy,(nothing hid) that shall not be opened: neither so secret, but that it shall come abroad.(that shall not be known)",
  "23": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
  "24": "And he said unto them: take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, with the same shall it be measured unto you again. And unto you that have(hear) shall more be given.",
  "25": "For unto him that hath, shall it be given: And unto(from) him that hath not, shall be taken away, even that he hath.",
  "26": "And he said: so is the kingdom of God, even as if a man should sow seed in the ground,",
  "27": "and should sleep and rise up night and day: and the seed should spring, and grow up while he is not ware.",
  "28": "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself, first the blade, then the ears, after that full corn in the ears.",
  "29": "And as soon as the fruit is brought forth, anon he thrusteth in the sickle because that harvest is come.",
  "30": "And he said: whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?",
  "31": "It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is the least of all seeds that be in the earth:",
  "32": "And(but) after that it is sown it groweth up, and is greatest of all herbs: and beareth great branches so that the fowls of the air may dwell under the shadow of it.",
  "33": "And with many such similitudes he preached the word unto them, after as they might hear it.",
  "34": "And without similitude spake he nothing unto them. But when they were apart, he expounded all things to his disciples.",

  "39": "And he rose up and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea: peace and be still. And the wind allayed, and there followed a great calm:",
  "40": "and he said unto them: why are ye (so) fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?",
  "41": "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another: what fellow is this? for both wind and sea obey him."
