  "4": "And they went their way, and found a colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met, and they loosed him.",

  "10": "Blessed be the kingdom that cometh in the name of him that is Lord of our father David. Hosianna in the highest.",
  "11": "And the Lord entered into Hierusalem, and into the temple. And when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.",
  "12": "And on the morrow when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered,",
  "13": "and he spied a fig tree afar off, having leaves, and went to see whether he might find anything thereon: but when he came thereto, he found nothing but leaves. For the time of figs was not yet.",

  "18": "And the scribes and high priests heard it and sought how to destroy him. For they feared him because all the people marveled at his doctrine.",
  "19": "And when even was come, he went out of the city.",
  "20": "And in the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up by the roots.(rotes)(that it was withered unto the rote)",
  "21": "And Peter remembered, and said unto him: master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst, is withered away.",
  "22": "And Jesus answered, and said unto them: Have confidence(faith) in God.",
  "23": "Verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain: take away thyself, and cast thyself into the sea, and shall not waver(doubt) in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he sayeth shall come to pass, whatsoever he sayeth shall be done to him.",
  "24": "Therefore I say unto you, whatsoever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye shall have(receive) it and it shall be done unto you.",
  "25": "And when ye stand and pray, forgive if ye have anything against any man: that your father also which is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses.",

  "27": "And they came again to Hierusalem, and as he walked in the temple, there came to him the high priests, and the scribes, and the seniors,(elders)",
  "28": "and said unto him: by what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority, to do these things?",
  "29": "Jesus answered, and said unto them: I will also ask of you a certain thing, and answer ye me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.",
  "30": "Whether was the baptism of John(The baptism of John, was it) from heaven, or of men? Answer me.",
  "31": "And they thought in themselves, saying: if we shall say, from heaven, he will say: why then did ye not believe him?",
  "32": "but if we shall say, of men, then fear we the people. For all men counted(held) John, that he was a very prophet.",
  "33": "And they answered, and said unto Jesu: we cannot tell. And Jesus answered, and said unto them: neither will I tell you, by what authority I do these things."
