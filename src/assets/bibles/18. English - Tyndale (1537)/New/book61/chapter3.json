  "9": "The Lord is not slack to fulfil his promise as some men count slackness: but is patient to us ward and would have no man lost, but would receive all men to repentance.(and will not that any man should be lost, but that every man should amend himself)",

  "17": "Ye therefore beloved seeing ye are warned;(know it beforehand) Beware lest ye be also plucked(plucte) away with the error of the wicked, and (fall from your) own steadfastness:",
