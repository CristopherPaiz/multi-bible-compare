  "1": "My brethren, be not every man a master; Remembering how that we shall receive the more damnation.",
  "2": "For in many things we sin all. If a man sin not in word, he(the same) is a perfect man and able to tame all the body.",
  "3": "Behold we put bits into the horses' mouths that they should obey us, and we turn about all the body.",
  "4": "Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the violence of the governor will:",
  "5": "even so the tongue is little member and boasteth great things. Behold how great a thing a little fire kindleth,",
  "6": "and the tongue is fire, and a world of wickedness. So is the tongue set among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth a fire all that we have of nature, and is itself set afire, even of hell.",
  "7": "All the natures of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and things of the sea, are meeked and tamed of the nature of man.",

  "15": "This wisdom descendeth not from above: but is earthy, and natural, and devilish:",
  "16": "For where envying and strife is, there is unstableness, and all manner of evil works:",
  "17": "but the wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, and without simulation:",
  "18": "yea, and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, of them that keep(maintain) peace."
