  "3": "And hereby we know that we have known him,(And hereby we are sure that we know him) if we keep his commandments.",
  "4": "He that saith I know him, and (yet) keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the verity(trueth) is not in him.",
  "5": "Whosoever(He that) keepeth his word, in him (verily) is the love of God perfect in deed. And thereby(hereby) know we that we are in him.",
  "6": "He that saith he bideth in him, ought to walk even as he walked.",
  "7": "Brethren I write no new commandment unto you: but that(an) old commandment which ye heard from(had at) the beginning. The(For an) old commandment is the word which ye heard from the beginning.",

  "13": "I write unto you fathers, how that ye have known him that was from the beginning. I write unto you young men, how that ye have overcome the wicked. I write unto you little(young) children, how that ye have known(know) the father.",
  "14": "I write unto you fathers, how that ye have known him that was from the beginning. I write unto you young men, how that ye are(be) strong: and the word of God abideth(dwelleth) in you, and (that) ye have overcome that(the) wicked.",
  "15": "See that ye love not the world, neither(nor) the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him.",

  "17": "And the world vanisheth(passeth) away, and the lust thereof: but he that fulfilleth(doeth) the will of God, abideth ever.",
  "18": "Little children it is (now) the last time,(hour) and as ye have heard how the(that) antichrist shall come: even (so) now are there many antichrists come already, whereby we know that it is the last time.(hour.)",
