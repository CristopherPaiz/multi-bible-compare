  "1": "Then fourteen years there after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took with me Titus also.",
  "2": "Yea, and I went up by revelation, and commended with them of the gospel,(Gospell) which I preach among the gentiles: but apart(between our selves) with them that are(which were) counted chief,(in reputation) lest it should have been thought that I should run, or had run in vain.",
  "3": "Also Titus which was with me, though he were a greek, yet was not compelled to be circumcised,",
  "4": "and that because of incomers being false brethren, which came in among others to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.",
  "5": "To whom we gave no room, no not for the space of an hour, as concerning to be brought into subjection: and that because that the truth of the gospel(gospell) might continue with you.",
  "6": "Of them which seemed to be great (what they were in time passed it maketh no matter to me: God looketh on no man's person)(For God looketh not on the outward appearance of men) nevertheless they which seem(seemed) great, added nothing to me:(taught me nothing)",
  "7": "But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel(gospell) over the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel(gospell) over circumcision was unto Peter",
  "8": "(For he that was mighty in Peter in the apostleship over the circumcision, the same was mighty in me among the gentiles:)",
  "9": "and as soon as(therefore when) James, Cephas, and John, which seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas their(the right) hands, and agreed with us that we should preach among the heathen, and they among the jews:",

  "12": "For yer that certain came(afore there came certain) from James, he ate with the gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision,",

  "14": "But when I saw that they went(walked) not the right way after the truth of the gospel,(gospell) I said unto Peter, before all men,(openly before all:) if thou being a jew, livest after the manner of the gentiles, and not as do the jews: why causest thou the gentiles to follow(live as do) the jews?",
  "15": "we which are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles,",
  "16": "know that a man is not justified(made righteous) by the deeds of the law: but by the faith of Jesus Christ: and(therefore) we have believed on Jesus Christ, that we might be justified(made righteous) by the faith of Christ and not by the deeds of the law: because that no flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the law:",
  "17": "If then while we seek to be made righteous by Christ, we ourselves are found sinners, is not then Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.",

  "21": "I despise not(cast not away) the grace of God: For if righteousness come of the law, then is Christ dead(died) in vain."
