  "1": "O foolish Galatians: who hath bewitched you, that ye should not believe the truth? to whom Jesus Christ was described before the eyes, and among you crucified?",
  "2": "This only would I learn of you, received ye the spirit by the deeds of the law? or else by preaching of the faith?",
  "3": "Are ye so unwise, that after ye have begun in the spirit, ye would now end in the flesh?",
  "4": "So many things (there) ye have suffered in vain. If it be so that ye have suffered in vain.(,if that be in vain.)",
  "5": "Which ministered to(He that giveth) you the spirit, and worketh miracles(doth such great acts) among you doth he it thorow the deeds of the law? or by preaching of the faith?",
  "6": "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was ascribed to him for righteousness.",
  "7": "Understand therefore,(Thus ye know) that they which are of faith, (the same) are the children of Abraham.",
  "8": "(For) The scripture saw aforehand, that God would justify the heathen thorow faith, and (therefore) shewed beforehand glad tidings unto Abraham: In thee shall all nations be blessed.",
  "9": "So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham.",
  "10": "For as many as are under the deeds(as go about with the works) of the law, are under malediction.(curse) For it is written: cursed is every man that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to fulfil(do) them.",
  "11": "That no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident. For the just shall live by faith.",
  "12": "The law is not of faith: but the man that fulfilleth the things contained in the law, shall live in them.(but the man that doth the same, shall live therein)",
  "13": "(But) Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the law, and was made a cursed for us (for it is written: Cursed is everyone that hangeth on tree)",
  "14": "that the blessing of Abraham might come on the gentiles thorow Jesus Christ, (and) that we might receive the promise of the spirit thorow faith.",
  "15": "Brethren I will speak after the manner of men. Though it be but a man's testament, yet no man despiseth it, or addeth any thing thereto when it is once allowed.(confrimed)",
  "16": "To Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith(seyth) not, in thy(the) seeds as in many: But in thy seed, as in one, which is Christ.",
  "17": "This I say that the law which began afterward, beyond four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul the testament, that was confirmed (afore) of God unto Christ ward, to make the promise of none effect.",
  "18": "For if the inheritance come of the law, it cometh not of promise: but God gave it unto Abraham by promise.",
  "19": "Wherefore then serveth the law? The law was added because of transgression (till the seed came to which the promise was made) and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.(given of angels, by the hand of the mediatour)",
  "20": "A mediator is not a mediator of one.(of one only) But God is one.",
  "21": "Is the law then against the promise of God? God forbid. (Howbeit) If there had been a law given which could have given life: then no doubt righteousness should have come by the law:",
  "22": "but the scripture concluded all things under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ, should be given unto them that believe.",
