  "1": "Brethren, if any man be fallen by chance into any(be overtaken of a) fault: ye which are spiritual, help to amend(enform) him, in the spirit of meekness: considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",
  "2": "Bear ye one another's burden: and so fulfil the law of Christ.",
  "3": "If a(any) man seem to himself that he is somewhat when indeed he is nothing, the same deceiveth himself in his imagination.",
  "4": "Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in his own self, and not in another.",
  "5": "For every man(one) shall bear his own burden.",
  "6": "Let him that is taught in the word, minister unto him that teacheth him in all good things.",
  "7": "Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap.",
  "8": "He that soweth in his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption:(destruction) but he that soweth in the spirit shall, of the spirit reap life everlasting.",
  "9": "Let us do good, and let us not faint.(Let us not be weary of well doing.) For when the time is come we shall reap without weariness.(ceasing)",
  "10": "While we have therefore time let us do good unto all men, and specially, unto them which are of the household of faith.",
  "11": "Behold how large a letter(with how many words) I have written unto you with mine own hand.",
  "12": "As many as desire with outward(uttwarde) appearance to please carnally,(They that will please in the flesh) they constrain you to be circumcised, only because they would not suffer persecution with the cross of Christ.",
  "13": "For they them selves which are circumcised keep not the law: but desire to have you circumcised that they might rejoice in your flesh.",
  "14": "God forbid that I should rejoice but in the cross of our Lord Jesu Christ, whereby the world is crucified as touching me, and I as concerning the world.",
  "15": "For in Christ Jesu nether circumcision availeth any thing at all nor uncircumcision: but a new creature.",
  "16": "And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on(upon) them, and mercy, and upon Israel that pertaineth to God.",
  "17": "From hence forth, let no man put me to business. For I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesu.",
  "18": "Brethren the grace of our Lord Jesu Christe be with your spirit, Amen. [Unto the Galatians written from Rome.]"
