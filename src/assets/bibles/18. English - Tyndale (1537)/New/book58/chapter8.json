  "1": "Of the things which we have spoken, this is the pith: that we have such an high(hye) priest that is sitten on the right hand of the seat of majesty in heaven,",
  "2": "and is a minister of wholy(holy) things, and of the very(true) tabernacle, which God pight,(pitched) and not man.",

  "11": "And they shall not teach, every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying: know the Lord: For they shall know me, from the least to the most of them:",
  "12": "For I will be merciful over their iniquities: and on their sins and on their unrighteousness, will I not think any more.(For I will be merciful over their unrighteousness, and on their sins and on their iniquities.)",
  "13": "In that he saith a new testament, he hath abrogate(weareth out) the old. Now that which is disannulled(worn out) and waxed old, is ready to vanish away."
