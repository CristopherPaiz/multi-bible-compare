  "1": "That first tabernacle verily had justifyings,(ordinances) and servings of God, and worldly(outward) holiness.",
  "2": "For that first tabernacle was made,(for there was a fore tabernacle made,) wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shew bread, which is called wholy.(Holy.)",
  "3": "Within(But behind) the second veil was the tabernacle,(But within the second vayle was there a tabernacle,) which is called holiest of all,",
  "4": "which had the golden censer, and the ark of the testament overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot with Manna, and Aaron's rod that sprung,(flourished) and the tables of the testament.",
  "5": "Over the ark(Above therein) were the cherubims of glory shadowing the seat of grace.(overshadowing the Mercyseat) Of which things, we will not now speak particularly.",
  "6": "When these things were thus ordained, the priests went always(all ways) into the first tabernacle and executed the service of God:",
  "7": "(But) Into the second went the high priest alone, once every(in the) year: but(and) not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the ignorance of the people:",
  "8": "(Wherewith) The holy ghost this signifying, that the way of holy things(holiness) was not yet opened, while as yet the first tabernacle was standing,",
  "9": "which was a similitude of this present time,(a similitude for the tyme then present,) in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which can(the time then present, and in which were offered gifts and sacrifices that could) not make them that minister perfect,(him, that did the Gods service) as pertaining to the conscience,",
  "10": "with meats only and drinks, and divers washings, and justifyings of the flesh, which were ordained until the time of reformation.",
  "11": "But Christ being an high(hye) priest of good things to come, came by a greater, and a more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands: that is to say, not of this manner building,",
  "12": "neither by the blood of goats, and calves: but by his own blood, he(we) entered once for all into the wholy(holy) place, and found eternal redemption.",
  "13": "For if the blood of oxen, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer, when it was sprinkled, purified(halloweth) the unclean, as touching the purifying(purification) of the flesh:",
  "14": "How much more shall the blood of Christ (which thorow the eternal spirit, offered himself without spot to God) purge our(your) consciences from dead works, for to serve the living God?",
  "15": "And for this cause is he the mediator of the new testament, that as sone (as his death was fulfilled for the redemption(that thorow death which chanced for the redemption) of those transgressions that were in the first testament) they which were called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.",
  "16": "For wheresoever is a testament, there must also be the death of him that maketh the testament.",
  "17": "For the testament taketh authority when men are dead: For it is of no value as long as he that made it is alive.",
  "18": "For which cause also, neither that first testament was ordained without blood.",
  "19": "For when all the commandments were read of Moses unto all the people, he took the blood of calves, and of goats, with water and purple wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,",
  "20": "saying this is the blood of the testament, which God hath appointed unto you.",
  "21": "Moreover, he sprinkled the tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministering vessels.(vessels of the Gods service)",
  "22": "And almost all things, according to(are by) the law, are cleansed(purged) with blood, and without effusion(shedding) of blood, is no remission.",
  "23": "It is then need(necessary) that the similitudes of heavenly things, be purified with such things: but the heavenly things themselves are purified with better sacrifices than are these.(those.)",
  "24": "For Christ is not entered into the holy places, that are made with hands, which are but similitudes of true things: but is entered into very heaven, for to appear now in the sight(before the face) of God for us.",
  "25": "Not to offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with strange blood:",
  "26": "for then must he have often suffered since the world began: But now in the end of the world, hath he appeared once for all,(hath he appeared once,) to put sin to flight, by the offering up of himself.",
  "27": "And as it is appointed unto men that they shall once die, and then cometh the judgment,",
  "28": "even so Christ was once offered to take away the sins of many, and unto them that look for him, shall he appear again, without sin unto their health.(salvation.)"
