  "1": "For the law which hath but the shadow of good things to come, and not the things in their own fashion, can never with the sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.",
  "2": "For would not then those sacrifices have ceased to have been offered? because that the offerers once purged, should have had no more consciences of sins.",
  "3": "Nevertheless in those sacrifices is there mention(a rememberance) made of sins every year.",
  "4": "For it is unpossible that the blood of oxen, and of goats should take away sins.",
  "5": "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not have: but a body hast thou ordained me,",
  "6": "holocausts and sacrifice for sin thou hast not allowed.(In sacrifices and sinofferings thou hast no lust.)",
  "7": "Then I said: Lo I come; In the beginning of the book it is written of me,(In the chiefest of the book it is written of me,) that I should do thy will, o God.",
  "8": "Above when he sayeth(had said) sacrifice, and offering, and holocausts,(burntsacrifices) and sacrifice for sin,(sinofferings) thou wouldest not have, neither hast allowed (which (yet) are offered by the law)",
  "9": "(And) then he said: Lo I am ready(come to) do thy will o God: he taketh away the first to stablish the latter.",
  "10": "By the which will we are sanctified, by the offering of the body of Jesu Christ once for all.",
  "11": "And every priest is ready daily ministering, and often times offereth one manner of offering, which can never take away sins:",
  "12": "but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, (which is of value for ever) sat him down for ever on the right hand of God,",
  "13": "and from henceforth tarrieth till his foes be made his footstool.",
  "14": "For with one offering hath he made perfect for ever them that are sanctified.",
  "15": "And the holy ghost also beareth us record of this, even when he told(said) before:",
  "16": "This is the testament that I will make unto them after those days saith the Lord. And I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,",
  "17": "and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.",
  "18": "And where remission of these things is, there is no more offering for sin.",

  "20": "by the new and living way, which he hath prepared for us, through the veil, that is to say by his flesh.",
  "21": "And seeing also that we have an high(hye) priest which is ruler over the house of God,",
  "22": "let us draw nigh with a true heart in a full faith sprinkled in our hearts, from an evil conscience, and washed in our bodies with pure water,",
  "23": "and let us keep the profession of our hope, without wavering (for he is faithful that promised)",
  "24": "and let us consider one another to provoke unto love,(the provoking of love) and to good works:",
  "25": "and let us not forsake the fellowship that we have among ourselves, as the manner of some is: but let us exhort one another, and that so much the more, because ye see that the day draweth nigh.",
  "26": "For if we sin willingly(willfully) after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins:",
  "27": "but a fearful looking for judgment, and violent fire, which shall devour the adversaries.",
  "28": "He that despiseth Moses' law, dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses.",
  "29": "Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy, which treadeth under foot the son of God: and counteth the blood of the testament as an unholy thing, wherewith he was(is) sanctified, and doth dishonour to the spirit of grace.",
  "30": "For we know him that hath said, vengeance belongeth unto me,(Vengance is mine) I will recompense saith the Lord. And again: the Lord shall judge his people.",

  "36": "For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.",
  "37": "For yet a very(over a) little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry:",
  "38": "But the just shall live by faith. And if he withdraw himself, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.",
  "39": "We are not which withdraw ourselves unto damnation, but pertain to faith, for to win our souls.(to the winning of the soul.)(but of them that believe to the winning of the soul)"
