  "1": "Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.",
  "2": "Hear, ye mountains, Jehovah's controversy, and ye, unchanging foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.",
  "3": "O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.",
  "4": "For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.",
  "5": "My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah.",
  "6": "Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?",
  "7": "Will Jehovah take pleasure in thousands of rams, in ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?",
  "8": "He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good: and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God?",
  "9": "Jehovah's voice crieth unto the city, and wisdom looketh on thy name. Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.",
  "10": "Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure [which is] abominable?",
  "11": "Shall I be pure with the unjust balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?",
  "12": "For her rich men are full of violence, and her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.",
  "13": "Therefore also will I make [thee] sick in smiting thee; I will make [thee] desolate because of thy sins.",
  "14": "Thou shalt eat, and not be satisfied, and thine emptiness [shall remain] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take away, and not save; and what thou savest will I give up to the sword.",
  "15": "Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and new wine, but shalt not drink wine.",
  "16": "For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab; and ye walk in their counsels: that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people."
