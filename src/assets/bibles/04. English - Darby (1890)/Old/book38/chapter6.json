  "3": "and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled, strong horses.",
  "4": "And I spoke and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?",
  "5": "And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.",
  "6": "That in which are the black horses goeth forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth towards the south country;",
  "7": "and the strong go forth, and seek to go that they may walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go, walk to and fro through the earth. And they walked to and fro through the earth.",

  "13": "even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.",
  "14": "And the crowns shall be for Helem, and for Tobijah, and for Jedaiah, and for Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.",
  "15": "And they that are far off shall come and build at the temple of Jehovah: and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God."
