  "1": "Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his days like the days of a hireling?",
  "2": "As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling expecteth his wages,",
  "3": "So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.",
  "4": "If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn.",
  "5": "My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and suppurates.",
  "6": "My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.",
  "7": "Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more see good.",
  "8": "The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [more]: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.",
  "9": "The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth down to Sheol shall not come up.",
  "10": "He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him again.",
  "11": "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?",
  "13": "When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;",
  "14": "Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions;",
  "15": "So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my bones.",
  "16": "I loathe it; I shall not live always: let me alone, for my days are a breath.",
  "17": "What is man, that thou makest much of him? and that thou settest thy heart upon him?",
  "18": "And that thou visitest him every morning, triest him every moment?",
  "19": "How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?",
  "20": "Have I sinned, what do I unto thee, thou Observer of men? Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee, so that I am become a burden to myself?",
  "21": "And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust, and thou shalt seek me early, and I shall not be."
