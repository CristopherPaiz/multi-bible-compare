  "1": "And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.",
  "2": "Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God;",
  "3": "and against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they found no answer, and [yet] condemned Job.",
  "4": "But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking, because they were older than he.",
  "5": "And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled.",
  "6": "And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared to shew you what I know.",
