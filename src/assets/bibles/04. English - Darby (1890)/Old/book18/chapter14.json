  "1": "Man, born of woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.",
  "2": "He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; and he fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not.",
  "3": "Yet dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?",
  "4": "Who can bring a clean [man] out of the unclean? Not one!",
  "5": "If his days are determined, if the number of his months is with thee, [and] thou hast appointed his bounds which he must not pass,",
  "6": "Look away from him; and let him rest, till he accomplish, as a hireling, his day.",
  "7": "For there is hope for a tree: if it be cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender branch will not cease;",
  "8": "Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground,",
  "9": "Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a young plant.",
  "10": "But a man dieth, and is prostrate; yea, man expireth, and where is he?",
  "11": "The waters recede from the lake, and the river wasteth and drieth up:",
  "12": "So man lieth down, and riseth not again; till the heavens be no more, they do not awake, nor are raised out of their sleep.",
  "13": "Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest keep me secret until thine anger be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me,",
  "14": "(If a man die, shall he live [again]?) all the days of my time of toil would I wait, till my change should come:",
  "15": "Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee; thou wouldest have a desire after the work of thy hands.",
  "16": "For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?",
  "17": "My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou heapest up mine iniquity.",
  "18": "And indeed a mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of its place;",
  "19": "The waters wear the stones, the floods thereof wash away the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.",
  "20": "Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth away; thou changest his countenance, and dismissest him.",
  "21": "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, and he perceiveth it not.",
  "22": "But his flesh hath pain for himself alone, and his soul mourneth for himself."
