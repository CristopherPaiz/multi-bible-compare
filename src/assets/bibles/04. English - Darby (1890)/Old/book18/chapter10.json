  "1": "My soul is weary of my life: I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "2": "I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou strivest with me.",
  "3": "Doth it please thee to oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?",
  "4": "Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?",
  "5": "Are thy days as the days of a mortal? are thy years as a man's days,",
  "6": "That thou searchest after mine iniquity, and inquirest into my sin;",
  "7": "Since thou knowest that I am not wicked, and that there is none that delivereth out of thy hand?",
  "8": "Thy hands have bound me together and made me as one, round about; yet dost thou swallow me up!",
  "9": "Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as clay, and wilt bring me into dust again.",
  "10": "Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?",
  "11": "Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews;",
  "12": "Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy care hath preserved my spirit;",
  "13": "And these things didst thou hide in thy heart; I know that this was with thee.",
  "14": "If I sinned, thou wouldest mark me, and thou wouldest not acquit me of mine iniquity.",
  "15": "If I were wicked, woe unto me! and righteous, I will not lift up my head, being [so] full of shame, and beholding mine affliction;",
  "16": "And it increaseth: thou huntest me as a fierce lion; and ever again thou shewest thy marvellous power upon me.",
  "17": "Thou renewest thy witnesses before me and increasest thy displeasure against me; successions [of evil] and a time of toil are with me.",
  "18": "And wherefore didst thou bring me forth out of the womb? I had expired, and no eye had seen me.",
  "19": "I should be as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.",
  "20": "Are not my days few? cease then and let me alone, that I may revive a little,",
  "21": "Before I go, and never to return, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;",
  "22": "A land of gloom, as darkness itself; of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as thick darkness."
