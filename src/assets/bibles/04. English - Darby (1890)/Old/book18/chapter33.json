  "1": "Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear mine utterances, and hearken to all my words.",
  "2": "Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my palate,",
  "3": "My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely.",
  "4": "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.",
  "5": "If thou canst, answer me; array [thy words] before me: take thy stand.",
  "6": "Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay.",
  "7": "Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee.",
  "8": "Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words:",

  "11": "He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.",
  "12": "Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right; for God is greater than man.",
  "13": "Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.",
  "14": "For God speaketh once, and twice, [and man] perceiveth it not",

  "16": "Then he openeth men's ears, and sealeth their instruction,",
  "17": "That he may withdraw man [from his] work, and hide pride from man.",
  "18": "He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.",
  "19": "He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with constant strife in his bones;",
  "20": "And his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food;",
  "21": "His flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that were not seen stick out;",
  "22": "And his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.",
  "23": "If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty;",
  "24": "Then he will be gracious unto him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.",
  "25": "His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood; he shall return to the days of his youth.",
  "26": "He shall pray unto God, and he will receive him with favour; and he shall see his face with shoutings, and he will render unto man his righteousness.",
  "27": "He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me;",
  "28": "He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light.",
  "29": "Lo, all these [things] worketh God twice, thrice, with man,",
  "30": "To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.",
  "31": "Mark well, Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.",
  "32": "If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.",
  "33": "If not, hearken thou unto me; be silent, and I will teach thee wisdom."
