  "3": "Withered up through want and hunger, they flee into waste places long since desolate and desert:",
  "4": "They gather the salt-wort among the bushes, and the roots of the broom for their food.",
  "5": "They are driven forth from among [men] they cry after them as after a thief",
  "6": "To dwell in gloomy gorges, in caves of the earth and the rocks:",
  "7": "They bray among the bushes; under the brambles they are gathered together:",

  "27": "My bowels well up, and rest not; days of affliction have confronted me.",
  "28": "I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up, I cry in the congregation.",
