  "1": "Moreover Elihu answered and said,",
  "2": "Hear my words, ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.",
  "3": "For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food.",
  "4": "Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good!",
  "5": "For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment:",
  "6": "Should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable without transgression.",
  "7": "What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water,",
  "8": "And goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.",
  "9": "For he hath said, It profiteth not a man if he delight himself in God.",
  "10": "Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be wickedness from God, and wrong from the Almighty!",
  "11": "For a man's work will he render to him, and cause every one to find according to [his] way.",
  "12": "Yea, surely, God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty perverteth not judgment.",
  "13": "Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed the whole world?",
  "14": "If he only thought of himself, [and] gathered unto him his spirit and his breath,",
  "15": "All flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust.",
  "16": "If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words!",
  "17": "Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just?",
  "18": "Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked?",
  "19": "[How then to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for they are all the work of his hands.",
  "20": "In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without hand.",
  "21": "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his steps.",
  "22": "There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.",
  "23": "For he doth not long consider a man, to bring him before God in judgment.",
  "24": "He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and setteth others in their stead;",
  "25": "Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them] in the night, and they are crushed.",
  "26": "He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others,",
  "27": "Because they have turned back from him, and would consider none of his ways;",
  "28": "So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.",
  "29": "When he giveth quietness, who then will disturb? and when he hideth [his] face, who shall behold him? and this towards a nation, or towards a man alike;",
  "30": "That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not ensnared.",
  "31": "For hath he said unto God, I bear [chastisement], I will not offend;",
  "32": "What I see not, teach thou me; if I have done wrong, I will do so no more?",
  "33": "Shall he recompense according to thy mind? for thou hast refused [his judgment]; for thou so choosest, and not I; speak then what thou knowest.",
  "34": "Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who heareth me:",
  "35": "Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were not with intelligence.",
  "36": "Would that Job may be tried unto the end, because of [his] answers after the manner of evil men!",
  "37": "For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
