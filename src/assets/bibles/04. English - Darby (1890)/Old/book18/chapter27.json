  "1": "And Job continued his parable and said,",

  "4": "My lips shall not speak unrighteousness, nor my tongue utter deceit!",
  "5": "Be it far from me that I should justify you; till I die I will not remove my blamelessness from me.",
  "6": "My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart reproacheth [me] not one of my days.",
  "7": "Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.",
  "8": "For what is the hope of the ungodly, when [God] cutteth him off, when God taketh away his soul?",
  "9": "Will God hear his cry when distress cometh upon him?",
  "10": "Doth he delight himself in the Almighty? will he at all times call upon God?",
  "11": "I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty will I not conceal.",

  "20": "Terrors overtake him like waters; a whirlwind stealeth him away in the night.",
  "21": "The east wind carrieth him away and he is gone; and as a storm it hurleth him out of his place.",
  "22": "And [God] shall cast upon him and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.",
  "23": "[Men] shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
