  "1": "Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook, and press down his tongue with a cord?",
  "2": "Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose, and pierce his jaw with a spike?",
  "3": "Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak softly unto thee?",
  "4": "Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him as a bondman for ever?",
  "5": "Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?",
  "6": "Shall partners make traffic of him, will they divide him among merchants?",
  "7": "Wilt thou fill his skin with darts, and his head with fish-spears?",
  "8": "Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle, do no more!",
  "9": "Lo, hope as to him is belied: is not one cast down even at the sight of him?",
  "10": "None is so bold as to stir him up; and who is he that will stand before me?",
  "11": "Who hath first given to me, that I should repay [him]? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.",
  "12": "I will not be silent as to his parts, the story of his power, and the beauty of his structure.",
  "13": "Who can uncover the surface of his garment? who can come within his double jaws?",
  "14": "Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.",
  "15": "The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.",
  "16": "One is so near to another that no air can come between them;",
  "17": "They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together, and cannot be sundered.",
  "18": "His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.",
  "19": "Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:",
  "20": "Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot and cauldron.",
  "21": "His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.",
  "22": "In his neck lodgeth strength, and terror danceth before him.",
  "23": "The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are fused upon him, they cannot be moved.",
  "24": "His heart is firm as a stone, yea, firm as the nether [millstone].",
  "25": "When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation.",
  "26": "If any reach him with a sword, it cannot hold; neither spear, nor dart, nor harpoon.",
  "27": "He esteemeth iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood.",
  "28": "The arrow will not make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.",
  "29": "Clubs are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.",
  "30": "His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.",
  "31": "He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment;",
  "32": "He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary.",
  "33": "Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.",
  "34": "He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts."
