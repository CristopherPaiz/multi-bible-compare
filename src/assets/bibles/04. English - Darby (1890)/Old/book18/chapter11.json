  "1": "And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,",
  "2": "Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man of much talk be justified?",
  "3": "Should thy fictions make men hold their peace? and shouldest thou mock, and no one make [thee] ashamed?",
  "4": "For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.",
  "5": "But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;",
  "6": "And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, how that they are the double of what is realised; and know that God passeth by [much] of thine iniquity!",
  "7": "Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?",
  "8": "[It is as] the heights of heaven; what wilt thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?",
  "9": "The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.",
  "10": "If he pass by, and shut up, and call to judgment, who can hinder him?",
  "11": "For he knoweth vain men, and seeth wickedness when [man] doth not consider it;",

  "13": "If thou prepare thy heart and stretch out thy hands toward him,",
  "14": "If thou put far away the iniquity which is in thy hand, and let not wrong dwell in thy tents;",
  "15": "Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear:",
  "16": "For thou shalt forget misery; as waters that are passed away shalt thou remember it;",
  "17": "And life shall arise brighter than noonday; though thou be enshrouded in darkness, thou shalt be as the morning,",
  "18": "And thou shalt have confidence, because there shall be hope; and having searched about [thee], thou shalt take rest in safety.",
  "19": "Yea, thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; and many shall seek thy favour.",
  "20": "But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and [all] refuge shall vanish from them, and their hope [shall be] the breathing out of life."
