  "1": "And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,",
  "2": "Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind,",
  "3": "Reasoning with unprofitable talk, and with speeches which do no good?",
  "4": "Yea, thou makest piety of none effect, and restrainest meditation before God.",
  "5": "For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty.",
  "6": "Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; and thy lips testify against thee.",
  "7": "Art thou the first man that was born? and wast thou brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "Hast thou listened in the secret council of God? And hast thou absorbed wisdom for thyself?",
  "9": "What knowest thou that we know not? [what] understandest thou which is not in us?",
  "10": "Both the greyheaded and the aged are with us, older than thy father.",
  "11": "Are the consolations of God too small for thee? and the word gently spoken to thee?",
  "12": "Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink?",
  "13": "That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest words go out of thy mouth?",
  "14": "What is man, that he should be pure? and he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?",
  "15": "Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight:",
  "16": "How much less the abominable and corrupt, man, that drinketh unrighteousness like water!",
  "17": "I will shew thee, listen to me; and what I have seen I will declare;",
  "18": "Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hidden;",
  "19": "Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.",
  "20": "All his days the wicked man is tormented, and numbered years are allotted to the violent.",
  "21": "The sound of terrors is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer cometh upon him.",
  "22": "He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is singled out for the sword.",
  "23": "He wandereth abroad for bread, where may it be? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.",
  "24": "Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready for the battle.",
  "25": "For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and strengthened himself against the Almighty:",
  "26": "He runneth against him, with [outstretched] neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers;",
  "27": "For he hath covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat upon [his] flanks.",
  "28": "And he dwelleth in desolate cities, in houses that no man inhabiteth, which are destined to become heaps.",
  "29": "He shall not become rich, neither shall his substance continue, and their possessions shall not extend upon the earth.",
  "30": "He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches; and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.",
  "31": "Let him not trust in vanity: he is deceived, for vanity shall be his recompense;",
  "32": "It shall be complete before his day, and his branch shall not be green.",
  "33": "He shall shake off his unripe grapes as a vine, and shall cast his flower as an olive.",
  "34": "For the family of the ungodly shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.",
  "35": "They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit."
