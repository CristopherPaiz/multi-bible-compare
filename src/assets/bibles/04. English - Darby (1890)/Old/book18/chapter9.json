  "1": "And Job answered and said,",
  "2": "Of a truth I know it is so; but how can man be just with God?",
  "3": "If he shall choose to strive with him, he cannot answer him one thing of a thousand.",
  "4": "He is wise in heart and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and had peace?",
  "5": "Who removeth mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger;",
  "6": "Who shaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble;",
  "7": "Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, and he sealeth up the stars;",
  "8": "Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the high waves of the sea;",
  "9": "Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;",
  "10": "Who doeth great things past finding out, and wonders without number.",
  "11": "Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not; and he passeth along, and I perceive him not.",
  "12": "Behold, he taketh away: who will hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?",
  "13": "God withdraweth not his anger; the proud helpers stoop under him:",
  "14": "How much less shall I answer him, choose out my words [to strive] with him?",
  "15": "Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.",
  "16": "If I had called, and he had answered me, I would not believe that he hearkened to my voice,",
  "17": "He, who crusheth me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "He suffereth me not to take my breath, for he filleth me with bitternesses.",
  "19": "Be it a question of strength, lo, [he is] strong; and be it of judgment, who will set me a time?",
  "20": "If I justified myself, mine own mouth would condemn me; were I perfect, he would prove me perverse.",
  "21": "Were I perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.",
  "22": "It is all one; therefore I said, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.",
  "23": "If the scourge kill suddenly, he mocketh at the trial of the innocent.",
  "24": "The earth is given over into the hand of the wicked [man]; he covereth the faces of its judges. If not, who then is it?",
  "25": "And my days are swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no good.",
  "26": "They pass by like skiffs of reed; as an eagle that swoops upon the prey.",
  "27": "If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my [sad] countenance, and brighten up,",
  "28": "I am afraid of all my sorrows; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.",
  "29": "Be it that I am wicked, why then do I labour in vain?",
  "30": "If I washed myself with snow-water, and cleansed my hands in purity,",
  "31": "Then wouldest thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes would abhor me.",
  "32": "For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; that we should come together in judgment.",
  "33": "There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both.",
  "34": "Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid,",
  "35": "[Then] I will speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me."
