  "1": "After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.",
  "2": "And Job answered and said,",
  "3": "Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, There is a man child conceived.",
  "4": "That day let it be darkness, let not God care for it from above, neither let light shine upon it:",
  "5": "Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.",
  "6": "That night let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.",
  "7": "Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;",
  "8": "Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;",
  "9": "Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:",
  "10": "Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes.",

  "16": "Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.",

  "18": "The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.",
  "19": "The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from his master.",
  "20": "Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and life to those bitter of soul,",
  "21": "Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;",
  "22": "Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave?",
  "23": "To the man whose way is hidden, and whom God hath hedged in?",
  "24": "For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.",
  "25": "For I feared a fear, and it hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.",
  "26": "I was not in safety, neither had I quietness, neither was I at rest, and trouble came."
