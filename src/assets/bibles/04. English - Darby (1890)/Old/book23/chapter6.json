  "1": "In the year of the death of king Uzziah, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.",
  "2": "Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew.",
  "3": "And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!",
  "4": "And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.",
  "5": "And I said, Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.",
  "6": "And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;",
  "7": "and he made it touch my mouth, and said, Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated.",
  "8": "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I; send me.",
  "9": "And he said, Go; and thou shalt say unto this people, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive.",
  "10": "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed.",
  "11": "And I said, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land become an utter desolation,",
  "12": "and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be great in the midst of the land.",
  "13": "But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose trunk [remaineth] after the felling: the holy seed shall be the trunk thereof."
