  "2": "And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with him from whom usury is taken.",
  "3": "The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for Jehovah hath spoken this word.",
  "4": "The land mourneth, it fadeth away; the world languisheth, it fadeth away: the haughty people of the land do languish.",
  "5": "And the land is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; for they have violated the laws, changed the statute, broken the everlasting covenant.",

  "7": "The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all that were merry-hearted do sigh;",
  "8": "the mirth of tambours ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.",
  "9": "They do not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to them that drink it.",
  "10": "The city of solitude is broken down; every house is shut up, so that none entereth in.",
  "11": "There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone;",
  "12": "desolation remaineth in the city, and the gate is smitten, a ruin.",
  "13": "For so will it be in the midst of the land among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the grape-gleanings when the vintage is done.",

  "15": "Therefore glorify Jehovah in the east, the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the west.",
  "16": "From the end of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous! And I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.",
  "17": "Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, inhabitant of the land.",
  "18": "And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the sound of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are open, and the foundations of the earth shake.",
  "19": "The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is completely dissolved, the earth is violently moved.",

  "21": "And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.",
