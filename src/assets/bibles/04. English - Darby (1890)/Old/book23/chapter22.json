  "10": "and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and have broken down the houses to fortify the wall;",
  "11": "and ye have made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not had regard unto the maker thereof, neither have ye looked unto him that fashioned it long ago.",
  "12": "And in that day did the Lord Jehovah of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth;",

  "14": "And it was revealed in mine ears by Jehovah of hosts: Assuredly this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.",
  "15": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts: Go, get thee in unto this steward, unto Shebna, who is over the house, [and say,]",

  "20": "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkijah;",
