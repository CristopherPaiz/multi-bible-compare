  "1": "For behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,",
  "2": "the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the diviner and the elder,",
  "3": "the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the clever among artificers, and the one versed in enchantments.",
  "4": "And I will appoint youths as their princes, and children shall rule over them.",
  "5": "And the people shall be oppressed one by the other, and each by his neighbour; the child will be insolent against the elder, and the base against the honourable.",
  "6": "When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his father's house, [and shall say:] Thou hast clothing; be our chief, and let this ruin be under thy hand;",
  "7": "he will lift up [his hand] in that day, saying, I cannot be a healer, and in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; ye shall not make me a chief of the people.",
  "8": "For Jerusalem stumbleth and Judah falleth, because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.",
  "9": "The look of their face doth witness against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom: they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have brought evil upon themselves.",
  "10": "Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well [with him], for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.",

  "12": "[As for] my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people! they that guide thee mislead [thee], and destroy the way of thy paths.",

  "14": "Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and their princes, [saying:] It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard: the spoil of the poor is in your houses.",
  "15": "What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the afflicted? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.",
  "16": "And Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-out neck and wanton eyes, and go along mincing, and making a tinkling with their feet;",
  "17": "therefore the Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.",
  "18": "In that day the Lord will take away the ornament of anklets, and the little suns and crescents,",
  "19": "the pearl-drops, and the bracelets, and the veils,",
  "20": "the head-dresses, and the stepping chains, and the girdles, and the scent-boxes, and the amulets;",
  "21": "the finger-rings, and the nose-rings;",
  "22": "the festival-robes, and the tunics, and the mantles, and the wallets;",
  "23": "the mirrors, and the fine linen bodices, and the turbans, and the flowing veils.",
  "24": "And it shall come to pass, instead of perfume there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe of display, a girding of sackcloth; brand instead of beauty.",
  "25": "Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the fight;",
  "26": "and her gates shall lament and mourn; and, stripped, she shall sit upon the ground."
