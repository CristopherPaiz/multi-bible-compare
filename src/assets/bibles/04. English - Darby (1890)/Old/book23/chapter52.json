  "3": "For thus saith Jehovah: Ye have sold yourselves for nought, and ye shall be redeemed without money.",
  "4": "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and Assyria oppressed them without cause;",
  "5": "and now, what have I here, saith Jehovah, that my people hath been taken away for nought? They that rule over them make them to howl, saith Jehovah; and continually all the day is my name scorned.",
  "6": "Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore [they shall know] in that day that I [am] HE, that saith, Here am I.",

  "15": "so shall he astonish many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for what had not been told them shall they see, and what they had not heard shall they consider."
