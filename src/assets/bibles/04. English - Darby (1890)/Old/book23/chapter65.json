  "1": "I am sought out of them that inquired not [for me], I am found of them that sought me not; I have said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.",
  "2": "I have stretched out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way not good, after their own thoughts;",
  "3": "the people that provoke me to anger continually to my face, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon the bricks;",
  "4": "who sit down among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things [is in] their vessels;",
  "5": "who say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.",
  "6": "Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,",
  "7": "your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and outraged me upon the hills; and I will measure their former work into their bosom.",
  "8": "Thus saith Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster, and it is said, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy [them] all.",
  "9": "And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah a possessor of my mountains; and mine elect shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there.",
  "10": "And the Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, and the valley of Achor a couching-place of the herds, for my people that have sought me.",
  "11": "But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and fill up mixed wine unto Meni:",
  "12": "I will even assign you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down in the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not answer, I spoke, and ye did not hear; but ye did what was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.",
  "13": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants shall eat, and *ye* shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, and *ye* shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, and *ye* shall be ashamed;",
  "14": "behold, my servants shall sing aloud for gladness of heart, and *ye* shall cry out for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.",
  "15": "And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mine elect; for the Lord Jehovah will slay thee, and will call his servants by another name:",
  "16": "so that he who blesseth himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the God of truth: because the former troubles shall be forgotten, and because they shall be hidden from mine eyes.",
  "17": "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.",
  "18": "But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.",
  "19": "And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and will joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.",
  "20": "There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not completed his days; for the youth shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.",
  "21": "And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof:",
  "22": "they shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.",
  "23": "They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.",
  "24": "And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear.",
  "25": "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah."
