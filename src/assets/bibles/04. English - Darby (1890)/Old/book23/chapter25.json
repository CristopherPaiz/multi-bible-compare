  "1": "Jehovah, thou art my God: I will exalt thee; I will celebrate thy name, for thou hast done wonderful things; counsels of old [which are] faithfulness [and] truth.",
  "2": "For thou hast made of the city a heap, of the fortified town a ruin, the palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built up.",
  "3": "Therefore shall the mighty people glorify thee, the city of terrible nations shall fear thee.",
  "4": "For thou hast been a fortress to the poor, a fortress for the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat: for the blast of the terrible ones [has been] as the storm [against] a wall.",
  "5": "Thou hast subdued the tumult of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; [as] the heat, by the shadow of a cloud, [so] the song of the terrible ones is brought low.",
  "6": "And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.",
  "7": "And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the veil which veileth all the peoples, and the covering that is spread over all the nations.",
  "8": "He will swallow up death in victory. And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken.",
  "9": "And it shall be said in that day, Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah, we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.",
  "10": "For in this mountain shall the hand of Jehovah rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, as straw is trodden down in the dunghill;",
  "11": "and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth them forth to swim; and he shall bring down their pride together with the plots of their hands.",
  "12": "And the fortress of the high defences of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, bring to the ground, into the dust."
