  "1": "In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation doth he appoint for walls and bulwarks.",
  "2": "Open ye the gates, and the righteous nation which keepeth faithfulness shall enter in.",
  "3": "Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind stayed [on thee], for he confideth in thee.",
  "4": "Confide ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the rock of ages.",
  "5": "For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low, he layeth it low to the ground, he bringeth it even to the dust.",
  "6": "The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the afflicted, the steps of the poor.",
  "7": "The way of the just is uprightness: thou, the Upright, dost make the path of the just even.",
  "8": "Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; the desire of [our] soul is to thy name, and to thy memorial.",
  "9": "With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.",
  "10": "If favour be shewn to the wicked, he doth not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he dealeth unjustly, and beholdeth not the majesty of Jehovah.",
  "11": "Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, but they do not see: [yet] they shall see [thy] jealousy [for] the people, and be ashamed; yea, the fire which is for thine adversaries shall devour them.",

  "15": "Thou hast increased the nation, Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified. Thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.",
  "16": "Jehovah, in trouble they sought thee; they poured out [their] whispered prayer when thy chastening was upon them.",
  "17": "As a woman with child, that draweth near her delivery, is in travail, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been before thee, Jehovah.",
  "18": "We have been with child, we have been in travail, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought the deliverance of the land, neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.",
  "19": "Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing in triumph, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is the dew of the morning, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.",
  "20": "Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past.",
  "21": "For behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them; and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain."
