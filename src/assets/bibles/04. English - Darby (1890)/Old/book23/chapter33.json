  "1": "Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and that dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; when thou shalt make an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.",
  "2": "Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be their arm every morning, yea, our salvation in the time of trouble.",
  "3": "At the noise of the tumult the peoples fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.",
  "4": "And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpillar: as the running of locusts shall they run upon it.",
  "5": "Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness;",
  "6": "and he shall be the stability of thy times, the riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah shall be your treasure.",
  "7": "Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the messengers of peace weep bitterly.",
  "8": "The highways are desolate, the wayfaring man ceaseth. He hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.",
  "9": "The land mourneth, it languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, is withered; the Sharon is become as a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped.",
  "10": "Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I be exalted, now will I lift up myself.",
  "11": "Ye shall conceive dry grass, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath shall devour you [as] fire.",
  "12": "And the peoples shall be [as] burnings of lime, [as] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.",
  "13": "Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and ye that are near, acknowledge my might.",
  "14": "The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath surprised the hypocrites: Who among us shall dwell with the consuming fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting flames?",
  "15": "He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking hold of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil:",
  "16": "he shall dwell on high, the fortresses of the rocks shall be his high retreat; bread shall be given him, his water shall be sure.",
  "17": "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is far off.",
  "18": "Thy heart shall meditate on terror: Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?",
  "19": "Thou shalt no more see the fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst comprehend, of a stammering tongue that cannot be understood.",
  "20": "Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be pulled up, neither shall any of its cords be broken;",
  "21": "but there Jehovah is unto us glorious, a place of rivers, of broad streams: no galley with oars shall go there, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.",
  "22": "For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah, our lawgiver, Jehovah, our king: he will save us.",
  "23": "Thy tacklings are loosed; they strengthen not the socket of their mast, they cannot spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.",
  "24": "And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven [their] iniquity."
