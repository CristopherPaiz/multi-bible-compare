  "1": "In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared unto me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.",
  "2": "And I saw in the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.",
  "3": "And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.",
  "4": "I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.",
  "5": "And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.",
  "6": "And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.",
  "7": "And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.",
  "8": "And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.",
  "9": "And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].",
  "10": "And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.",
  "11": "(And he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and from him the continual [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.",
  "12": "And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [sacrifice] by reason of transgression.) And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised and prospered.",
  "13": "And I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual [sacrifice] and of the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot?",
  "14": "And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings: then shall the sanctuary be vindicated.",
  "15": "And it came to pass, when I Daniel had seen the vision, I sought for the understanding of it, and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.",
  "16": "And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai; and he called and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.",
  "17": "And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face; and he said unto me, Understand, son of man; for the vision is for the time of the end.",
  "18": "Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep stupor, with my face toward the ground. And he touched me, and set me up where I had stood.",
  "19": "And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation: for at the set time the end shall be.",
  "20": "The ram that thou sawest having the two horns: they are the kings of Media and Persia.",
  "21": "And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king.",
  "22": "Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its stead, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.",
  "23": "And at the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors shall have come to the full, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.",
  "24": "And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously, and shall prosper, and shall practise, and shall destroy the mighty ones, and the people of the saints.",
  "25": "And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify [himself] in his heart, and by prosperity will corrupt many; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes: but he shall be broken without hand.",
  "26": "And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true; but close thou up the vision, for it is for many days [to come].",
  "27": "And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days: then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it]."
