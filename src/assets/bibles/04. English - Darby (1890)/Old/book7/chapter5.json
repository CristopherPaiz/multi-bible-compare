  "6": "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, The roads were unused, and the travellers on highways went by crooked paths.",

  "8": "They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?",
  "9": "My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!",
  "10": "Ye that ride on white she-asses, ye that sit on carpets, and ye that walk by the way, consider.",
  "11": "Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.",
  "12": "Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead captive thy captives, thou son of Abinoam!",
  "13": "Then come down, thou, the remnant of nobles, [as his] people; Jehovah! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones.",
  "14": "Out of Ephraim [came] those whose root was in Amalek; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler.",
  "15": "And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; And Issachar, like Barak; They were sent into the valley at his feet. In the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart!",
  "16": "Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the bleating of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great deliberations of heart!",
  "17": "Gilead abode beyond Jordan; And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat on the sea-shore, And abode in his creeks.",
  "18": "Zebulun is a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto death, Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.",
  "19": "Kings came, they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.",
  "20": "From heaven was the fight; The stars from their courses fought with Sisera.",
  "21": "The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. My soul, thou hast trodden down strength!",
  "22": "Then did the horse-hoofs clatter with the coursings, The coursings of their steeds.",

  "24": "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, Blessed above women in the tent!",
  "25": "He asked water, she gave milk; In the nobles' bowl she brought forth cream.",
  "26": "She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And she smote Sisera, she struck through his head, Shattered and pierced through his temples.",
  "27": "Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell, overcome.",
  "28": "Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window, And crieth through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots?",
  "29": "The wise amongst her ladies answer [her], Yea, she returneth answer to herself,",
  "30": "Have they not found, divided the booty, A damsel, two damsels, to each? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery, Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler?",
  "31": "So let all thine enemies perish, Jehovah! But let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might. And the land had rest forty years."
