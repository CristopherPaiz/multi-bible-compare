  "1": "I am a narcissus of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.",
  "2": "As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.",
  "3": "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons: In his shadow have I rapture and sit down; And his fruit is sweet to my taste.",
  "4": "He hath brought me to the house of wine, And his banner over me is love.",
  "5": "Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes, Refresh me with apples; For I am sick of love.",
  "6": "His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me.",
  "7": "I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.",
  "8": "The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.",
  "9": "My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the windows, Glancing through the lattice.",
  "10": "My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.",
  "11": "For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over, it is gone:",
  "12": "The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;",
  "13": "The fig-tree melloweth her winter figs, And the vines in bloom give forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away!",
  "14": "My dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.",
  "15": "Take us the foxes, The little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in bloom.",
  "16": "My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies,",
  "17": "Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away. Turn, my beloved: be thou like a gazelle or a young hart, Upon the mountains of Bether."
