  "3": "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies.",
  "4": "Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as troops with banners:",
  "5": "Turn away thine eyes from me, For they overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.",
  "6": "Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among them.",
  "7": "As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.",
  "8": "There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number:",

  "11": "I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the verdure of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether the pomegranates blossomed.",
  "12": "Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people.",
  "13": "Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. What would ye look upon in the Shulamite? As it were the dance of two camps."
