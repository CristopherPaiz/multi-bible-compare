  "1": "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a flock of goats, On the slopes of mount Gilead.",
  "2": "Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among them.",
  "3": "Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy speech is comely; As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.",
  "4": "Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built for an armoury: A thousand bucklers hang thereon, All shields of mighty men.",
  "5": "Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, Which feed among the lilies.",
  "6": "Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.",
  "7": "Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.",
  "8": "[Come] with me, from Lebanon, [my] spouse, With me from Lebanon, Come, look from the top of Amanah, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.",
  "9": "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.",
  "10": "How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine ointments than all spices!",
  "11": "Thy lips, [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb; Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.",
  "12": "A garden enclosed is my sister, [my] spouse; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.",
  "13": "Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants;",
  "14": "Spikenard and saffron; Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:",
  "15": "A fountain in the gardens, A well of living waters, Which stream from Lebanon.",
  "16": "Awake, north wind, and come, [thou] south; Blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits."
