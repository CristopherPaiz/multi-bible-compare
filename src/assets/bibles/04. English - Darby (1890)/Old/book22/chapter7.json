  "1": "How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist.",
  "2": "Thy navel is a round goblet, [which] wanteth not mixed wine; Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with lilies;",
  "3": "Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle;",
  "4": "Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes, [like] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus;",
  "5": "Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the locks of thy head like purple; The king is fettered by [thy] ringlets!",
  "6": "How fair and how pleasant art thou, [my] love, in delights!",
  "7": "This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to grape clusters.",
  "8": "I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples,",
  "9": "And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the lips of them that are asleep.",
  "10": "I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me.",
  "11": "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; Let us lodge in the villages.",
  "12": "We will go up early to the vineyards, We will see if the vine hath budded, [If] the blossom is opening, And the pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves.",
  "13": "The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our gates are all choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee, my beloved."
