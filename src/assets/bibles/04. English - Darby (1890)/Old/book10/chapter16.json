  "1": "And when David was a little past the summit, behold, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and a hundred cakes of summer fruits, and a flask of wine.",
  "2": "And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.",
  "3": "And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.",
  "4": "And the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly bow myself: may I find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.",
  "5": "And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed,",
  "6": "and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.",
  "7": "And thus said Shimei as he cursed: Away, away, thou man of blood and man of Belial!",
  "8": "Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold, thou art [taken] in thine own evil, for thou art a man of blood.",
  "9": "And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.",
  "10": "And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, for Jehovah has said to him, Curse David! Who shall then say, Why dost thou so?",
  "11": "And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now a Benjaminite? let him alone and let him curse; for Jehovah has bidden him.",
  "12": "It may be that Jehovah will look on mine affliction, and that Jehovah will requite me good for my being cursed this day.",
  "13": "And David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.",
  "14": "And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.",
  "15": "Now Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.",
  "16": "And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!",
  "17": "And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why didst thou not go with thy friend?",
  "18": "And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.",
  "19": "And again, whom should I serve? should it not be in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.",
  "20": "And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.",
  "21": "And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art become odious with thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strong.",
  "22": "So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.",
  "23": "And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
