  "1": "At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;",
  "2": "and they shall spread them out to the sun and to the moon and to all the host of the heavens, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the ground.",
  "3": "And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, in all the places whither I have driven those that remain, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
  "4": "And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Do [men] fall, and not rise up? Doth one turn away, and not return?",
  "5": "Why hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back with a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.",
  "6": "I hearkened and heard: they speak not what is right; there is no man who repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turneth to his course, like a horse rushing into the battle.",
  "7": "Even a stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of Jehovah.",
  "8": "How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? Behold, certainly the lying pen of the scribes hath made it falsehood.",
  "9": "The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected Jehovah's word; and what wisdom is in them?",
  "10": "Therefore will I give their wives unto others, their fields to those that shall possess [them]; for every one, from the least even unto the greatest, is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.",
  "11": "And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.",
  "12": "Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination? Nay, they are not at all ashamed, and they know not how to blush. Therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall stumble, saith Jehovah.",
  "13": "I will utterly take them away, saith Jehovah: there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree; and the leaf is faded: and I will give them up to those that shall pass over them.",
  "14": "Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced cities, and let us be silent there: for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.",
  "15": "Peace is looked for, and there is no good; a time of healing, and behold, terror.",
  "16": "The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: the whole land trembleth at the sound of the neighing of his steeds, and they come, and devour the land, and all it contains, the city and those that dwell therein.",
  "17": "For behold, I send among you serpents, vipers against which there is no charm, and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.",
  "18": "My comfort in my sadness! my heart is faint in me!",
  "19": "Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people, from a very far country: Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, with foreign vanities?",
  "20": "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.",
  "21": "For the breach of the daughter of my people am I crushed; I go mourning; astonishment hath taken hold of me.",
  "22": "Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? Why then is there no dressing applied for the healing of the daughter of my people?"
