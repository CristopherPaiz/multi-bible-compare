  "9": "And at the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant,",
  "10": "if it do evil in my sight, that it hearken not unto my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them.",

  "17": "As with an east wind will I scatter them before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.",
  "18": "And they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor word from the prophet. Come and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.",
  "19": "Jehovah, give heed to me, and listen to the voice of those that contend with me.",
