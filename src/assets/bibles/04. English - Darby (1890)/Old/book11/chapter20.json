  "32": "And they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-Hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.",
  "33": "And the men took it as a good omen, and hastened to catch what came from him, and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad. And he said, Go, bring him. And Ben-Hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.",
  "34": "And [Ben-Hadad] said to him, The cities that my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I [said Ahab] will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.",
