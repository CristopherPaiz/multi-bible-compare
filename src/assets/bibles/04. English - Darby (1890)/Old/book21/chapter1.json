  "1": "The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.",
  "2": "Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity.",
  "3": "What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun?",
  "4": "[One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever.",
  "5": "The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.",
  "6": "The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.",
  "7": "All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.",
  "8": "All things are full of toil; none can express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.",
  "9": "That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.",
  "10": "Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.",
  "11": "There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards.",
  "12": "I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
  "13": "And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith.",
  "14": "I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.",
  "15": "That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.",
  "16": "I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge.",
  "17": "And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind.",
  "18": "For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."
