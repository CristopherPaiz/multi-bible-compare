  "3": "Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.",
  "4": "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth.",
  "5": "It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to hear the song of fools.",
  "6": "For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.",
  "7": "Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart.",

  "11": "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun.",
  "12": "For wisdom is a defence [as] money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, [that] wisdom maketh them that possess it to live.",
  "13": "Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked?",
  "14": "In the day of prosperity enjoy good, and in the day of adversity consider: God hath also set the one beside the other, to the end that man should find out nothing [of what shall be] after him.",

  "16": "Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?",
  "17": "Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?",
  "18": "It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God cometh forth from them all.",
  "19": "Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] that are in a city.",

  "24": "Whatever hath been, is far off, and exceeding deep: who will find it out?",

  "27": "See this which I have found, saith the Preacher, [searching] one by one to find out the reason;",

  "29": "Only see this which I have found: that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices."
