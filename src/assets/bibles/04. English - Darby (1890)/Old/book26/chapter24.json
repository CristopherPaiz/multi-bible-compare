  "1": "And in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
  "2": "Son of man, write thee the name of the day, of this selfsame day: on this selfsame day the king of Babylon draws near to Jerusalem.",
  "3": "And propose a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Set on the pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it.",
  "4": "Gather the pieces thereof into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones:",
  "5": "take the choice of the flock; and also [put] a pile of wood under it, for the bones; make it boil well, and let the bones of it seethe therein.",
  "6": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it:",
  "7": "for her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.",
  "8": "That it might cause fury to come up to execute vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.",
  "9": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.",
  "10": "Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, boil thoroughly the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.",
  "11": "Then set it empty upon its coals, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, [and] that its rust may be consumed.",
  "12": "She hath exhausted [her] labours, yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her: let her rust be in the fire.",
  "13": "In thy filthiness is lewdness, for I have purged thee, and thou art not pure. Thou shalt no more be purged from thy filthiness, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee.",
  "14": "I Jehovah have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, nor will I repent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
  "15": "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
  "16": "Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.",
  "17": "Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy turban upon thee, and put thy sandals upon thy feet, and cover not the beard, and eat not the bread of men.",
  "18": "And I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.",
  "19": "And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, which thou doest?",
  "20": "And I said to them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
  "21": "Say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and your soul's longing; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.",
  "22": "And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover the beard, neither eat the bread of men;",
  "23": "and your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall waste away in your iniquities and moan one toward another.",
  "24": "Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when it cometh, then ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.",
  "25": "And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereunto they lift up their soul, their sons and their daughters,",
  "26": "that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause [thine] ears to hear [it]?",
  "27": "In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb. So shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah."
