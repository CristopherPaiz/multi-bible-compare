  "25": "The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy traffic; and thou wast replenished, and highly honoured, in the heart of the seas.",
  "26": "Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.",
  "27": "Thy substance, and thy markets, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, they that repair thy leaks, and they that barter with thee, and all thy men of war that are in thee, along with all thine assemblage which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall.",
  "28": "The open places shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.",
  "29": "And all that handle the oar, the mariners, all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,",

  "31": "And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth; and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.",
