  "3": "and said, Lord, if now I have found favour in thine eyes, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.",
  "4": "Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.",
  "5": "And I will fetch a morsel of bread; and refresh yourselves; after that ye shall pass on; for therefore have ye passed on towards your servant. And they said, So do as thou hast said.",

  "7": "And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf tender and good, and gave [it] to the attendant; and he hasted to dress it.",
  "8": "And he took thick and sweet milk, and the calf that he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood before them under the tree, and they ate.",

  "10": "And he said, I will certainly return to thee at [this] time of the year, and behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening at the tent-door, which was behind him.",
  "11": "Now Abraham and Sarah were old [and] advanced in age: it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.",
  "12": "And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old, shall I have pleasure, and my lord old?",
  "13": "And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why is this, that Sarah laughs, saying, Shall I indeed bear, when I am become old?",

  "21": "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know [it].",
  "22": "And the men turned thence, and went towards Sodom; and Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah.",
  "23": "And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also cause the righteous to perish with the wicked?",
  "24": "There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?",
  "25": "Far be it from thee to do so, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that the righteous should be as the wicked far be it from thee! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?",
  "26": "And Jehovah said, If I find at Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sakes.",

  "28": "Perhaps there may want five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city on account of the five? And he said, If I shall find forty-five there, I will not destroy [it].",
  "29": "And he continued yet to speak with him, and said, Perhaps there may be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.",
