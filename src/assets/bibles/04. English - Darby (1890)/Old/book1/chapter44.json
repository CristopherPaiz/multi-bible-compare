  "1": "And he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry; and put every man's money in the mouth of his sack.",
  "2": "And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain-money. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.",
  "3": "In the morning, when it was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.",
  "4": "They were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Up! follow after the men; and when thou overtakest them, thou shalt say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?",
  "5": "Is not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil [in] what ye have done.",
  "6": "And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.",
  "7": "And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing!",
  "8": "Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?",
  "9": "With whomsoever of thy servants it is found, let him die; and we also will be my lord's bondmen.",
  "10": "And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye shall be blameless.",
  "11": "And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground, and opened every man his sack.",
  "12": "And he searched carefully: he began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.",
  "13": "Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and they returned to the city.",
  "14": "And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground.",
  "15": "And Joseph said to them, What deed is this which ye have done? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?",
  "16": "And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found.",
  "17": "And he said, Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.",
  "18": "Then Judah came near to him, and said, Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.",
  "19": "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?",
  "20": "And we said to my lord, We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, [yet] young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.",
  "21": "And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eye on him.",
  "22": "And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father: if he should leave his father, [his father] would die.",
  "23": "And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.",
  "24": "And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.",
  "25": "And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.",
  "26": "But we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.",
  "27": "And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons];",
  "28": "and the one went out from me, and I said, He must certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him [again] hitherto.",
  "29": "And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol.",
  "30": "And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us, seeing that his life is bound up with his life,",
  "31": "it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not [there], that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.",
  "32": "For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days.",
  "33": "And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren;",
  "34": "for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me? lest I see the evil that would come on my father."
