  "1": "And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father sojourned in the land of Canaan.",

  "8": "And his brethren said to him, Wilt thou indeed be a king over us? wilt thou indeed rule over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.",
  "9": "And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamt another dream, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.",
  "10": "And he told [it] to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamt? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?",
  "11": "And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying.",

  "15": "And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the country; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?",
  "16": "And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks].",
  "17": "And the man said, They have removed from this; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them at Dothan.",
  "18": "And when they saw him from afar, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.",
  "19": "And they said one to another, Behold, there comes that dreamer!",
  "20": "And now come and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him; and we will see what becomes of his dreams.",
  "21": "And Reuben heard [it], and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.",
  "22": "And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood: cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness; but lay no hand upon him in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him to his father again.",
  "23": "And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his vest, the vest of many colours, which he had on;",
  "24": "and they took him and cast him into the pit; now the pit was empty there was no water in it.",
  "25": "And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead; and their camels bore tragacanth, and balsam, and ladanum going to carry [it] down to Egypt.",
  "26": "And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it that we kill our brother and secrete his blood?",
  "27": "Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened [to him].",
  "28": "And Midianitish men, merchants, passed by; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces; and they brought Joseph to Egypt.",
  "29": "And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his garments,",
  "30": "and returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?",
  "31": "And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the vest in the blood;",
  "32": "and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father, and said, This have we found: discern now whether it is thy son's vest or not.",
  "33": "And he discerned it, and said, [It is] my son's vest! an evil beast has devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces!",
  "34": "And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.",
  "35": "And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and said, For I will go down to my son into Sheol mourning. Thus his father wept for him.",
