  "3": "Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor; make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.",
  "4": "And it shall be, when he lies down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall have lain down, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thyself down; and he will shew thee what thou shalt do.",
  "5": "And she said to her, All that thou sayest will I do.",

  "13": "Stay over to-night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will redeem thee, well let him redeem; but if he like not to redeem thee, then will I redeem thee, [as] Jehovah liveth. Lie down until the morning.",
  "14": "And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the threshing-floor.",

  "16": "And she came to her mother-in-law; and she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.",
  "17": "And she said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.",
  "18": "Then she said, Be still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day."
