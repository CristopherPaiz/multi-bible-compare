  "29": "And David said, What have I now done? Was it not laid upon me?",
  "30": "And he turned from him to another, and spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him again after the former manner.",
  "31": "And the words were heard which David spoke, and they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.",
  "32": "And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him: thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.",

  "38": "And Saul clothed David with his dress, and put a helmet of bronze upon his head, and clothed him with a corselet.",
  "39": "And David girded his sword upon his dress, and endeavoured to go; for he had not yet tried [it]. And David said to Saul, I cannot go in these; for I have never tried [them]. And David put them off him.",
  "40": "And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag that he had, into the pocket; and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.",
  "41": "And the Philistine came on and approached David; and the man that bore the shield was before him.",
  "42": "And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was a youth, and ruddy, and besides of a beautiful countenance.",
  "43": "And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.",
  "44": "And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.",
  "45": "And David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with sword, and with spear, and with javelin; but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.",
  "46": "This day will Jehovah deliver thee up into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth. And all the earth shall know that Israel has a God;",
  "47": "and all this congregation shall know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hands.",
  "48": "And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and advanced to meet David, that David hasted, and ran towards the ranks to meet the Philistine.",
  "49": "And David put his hand into the bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.",
  "50": "So David overcame the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and smote the Philistine and killed him; and there was no sword in the hand of David.",
  "51": "And David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him completely, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.",
  "52": "And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to the ravine and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.",
  "53": "And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camps.",
  "54": "And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.",
  "55": "And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.",
  "56": "And the king said, Inquire thou whose son this youth is.",
  "57": "And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.",
  "58": "And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man? And David said, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite."
