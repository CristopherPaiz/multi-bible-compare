  "1": "{A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah.} Jehovah, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee.",
  "2": "Hide not thy face from me: in the day of my trouble, incline thine ear unto me; in the day I call, answer me speedily.",
  "3": "For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand.",
  "4": "My heart is smitten and withered like grass; yea, I have forgotten to eat my bread.",
  "5": "By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my flesh.",
  "6": "I am become like the pelican of the wilderness, I am as an owl in desolate places;",
  "7": "I watch, and am like a sparrow alone upon the housetop.",
  "8": "Mine enemies reproach me all the day; they that are mad against me swear by me.",
  "9": "For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,",
  "10": "Because of thine indignation and thy wrath; for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.",
  "11": "My days are like a lengthened-out shadow, and I, I am withered like grass.",
  "12": "But thou, Jehovah, abidest for ever, and thy memorial from generation to generation.",
  "13": "*Thou* wilt rise up, thou wilt have mercy upon Zion: for it is the time to be gracious to her, for the set time is come.",
  "14": "For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour her dust.",
  "15": "And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.",
  "16": "When Jehovah shall build up Zion, he will appear in his glory.",

  "18": "This shall be written for the generation to come; and a people that shall be created shall praise Jah:",
  "19": "For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from the heavens hath Jehovah beheld the earth,",
  "20": "To hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to die;",
  "21": "That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,",
  "22": "When the peoples shall be gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.",
  "23": "He weakened my strength in the way, he shortened my days.",
  "24": "I said, My God, take me not away in the midst of my days! Thy years are from generation to generation.",
  "25": "Of old hast thou founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands:",
  "26": "*They* shall perish, but *thou* continuest; and all of them shall grow old as a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.",
  "27": "But thou art the Same, and thy years shall have no end.",
  "28": "The children of thy servants shall abide, and their seed shall be established before thee."
