  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?",
  "2": "When evil-doers, mine adversaries and mine enemies, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.",
  "3": "If a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; if war rise against me, in this will I be confident.",
  "4": "One [thing] have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire [of him] in his temple.",
  "5": "For in the day of evil he will hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tent will he keep me concealed: he will set me high upon a rock.",
  "6": "And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tent sacrifices of shouts of joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms unto Jehovah.",
  "7": "Hear, Jehovah; with my voice do I call; be gracious unto me, and answer me.",
  "8": "My heart said for thee, Seek ye my face. Thy face, O Jehovah, will I seek.",
  "9": "Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.",
  "10": "For had my father and my mother forsaken me, then had Jehovah taken me up.",
  "11": "Teach me thy way, Jehovah, and lead me in an even path, because of mine enemies.",
  "12": "Deliver me not over to the will of mine adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.",
  "13": "Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living !",
  "14": "Wait for Jehovah; be strong and let thy heart take courage: yea, wait for Jehovah."
