  "1": "{A Song, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. To the chief Musician. Upon Mahalath Leannoth. An instruction. Of Heman the Ezrahite.} Jehovah, God of my salvation, I have cried by day [and] in the night before thee.",
  "2": "Let my prayer come before thee; incline thine ear unto my cry.",
  "3": "For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh to Sheol.",
  "4": "I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no strength:",
  "5": "Prostrate among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave; whom thou rememberest no more, and who are cut off from thy hand.",
  "6": "Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps.",
  "7": "Thy fury lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted [me] with all thy waves. Selah.",
  "8": "Thou hast put my familiar friends far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.",
  "9": "Mine eye consumeth by reason of affliction. Upon thee, Jehovah, have I called every day; I have stretched out my hands unto thee.",
  "10": "Wilt thou do wonders to the dead? shall the shades arise and praise thee? Selah.",
  "11": "Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? thy faithfulness in Destruction?",
  "12": "Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?",

  "14": "Why, O Jehovah, castest thou off my soul? [why] hidest thou thy face from me?",
  "15": "I am afflicted and expiring from my youth up; I suffer thy terrors, [and] I am distracted.",
  "16": "Thy fierce anger hath gone over me; thy terrors have brought me to nought:",
  "17": "They have surrounded me all the day like water; they have compassed me about together.",
  "18": "Lover and associate hast thou put far from me: my familiar friends are darkness.",
