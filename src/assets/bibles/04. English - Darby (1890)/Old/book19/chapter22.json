  "1": "{To the chief Musician. Upon Aijeleth-Shahar. A Psalm of David.} My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [why art thou] far from my salvation, from the words of my groaning?",
  "2": "My God, I cry by day, and thou answerest not; and by night, and there is no rest for me:",
  "3": "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel.",
  "4": "Our fathers confided in thee: they confided, and thou didst deliver them.",
  "5": "They cried unto thee, and were delivered; they confided in thee, and were not confounded.",
  "6": "But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and the despised of the people.",
  "7": "All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying:]",
  "8": "Commit it to Jehovah let him rescue him; let him deliver him, because he delighteth in him!",
  "9": "But thou art he that took me out of the womb; thou didst make me trust, upon my mother's breasts.",
  "10": "I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother's belly.",
  "11": "Be not far from me, for trouble is near; for there is none to help.",
  "12": "Many bulls have encompassed me; Bashan's strong ones have beset me round.",
  "13": "They gape upon me with their mouth, [as] a ravening and a roaring lion.",
  "14": "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is become like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.",
  "15": "My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my palate; and thou hast laid me in the dust of death.",
  "16": "For dogs have encompassed me; an assembly of evil-doers have surrounded me: they pierced my hands and my feet.",
  "17": "I may count all my bones. They look, they stare upon me;",
  "18": "They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.",
  "19": "But thou, Jehovah, be not far [from me]; O my strength, haste thee to help me.",
  "20": "Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the power of the dog;",
  "21": "Save me from the lion's mouth. Yea, from the horns of the buffaloes hast thou answered me.",
  "22": "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.",
  "23": "Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and revere him, all ye the seed of Israel.",
  "24": "For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him: but when he cried unto him, he heard.",
  "25": "My praise is from thee, in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear him.",
  "26": "The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise Jehovah that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.",
  "27": "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah, and all the families of the nations shall worship before thee:",
  "28": "For the kingdom is Jehovah's, and he ruleth among the nations.",
  "29": "All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, and he that cannot keep alive his own soul.",
  "30": "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.",
  "31": "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done [it]."
