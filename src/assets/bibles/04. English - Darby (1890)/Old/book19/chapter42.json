  "1": "{To the chief Musician. An instruction; of the sons of Korah.} As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.",
  "2": "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?",
  "3": "My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?",
  "4": "These things I remember and have poured out my soul within me: how I passed along with the multitude, how I went on with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a festive multitude.",
  "5": "Why art thou cast down, my soul, and art disquieted in me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, [for] the health of his countenance.",
  "6": "My God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and the Hermons, from mount Mizar.",
  "7": "Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy cataracts; all thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me.",
  "8": "In the day-time will Jehovah command his loving-kindness, and in the night his song shall be with me, a prayer unto the God of my life.",
  "9": "I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?",
  "10": "As with a crushing in my bones mine adversaries reproach me, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?",
  "11": "Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and my God."
