  "1": "{A Psalm, a Song, for the Sabbath day.} It is good to give thanks unto Jehovah, and to sing psalms unto thy name, O Most High;",
  "2": "To declare thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness in the nights,",
  "3": "Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the lute; upon the Higgaion with the harp.",
  "4": "For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in the works of thy hands.",
  "5": "Jehovah, how great are thy works! Thy thoughts are very deep:",
  "6": "A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand it.",
  "7": "When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they may be destroyed for ever.",
  "8": "And thou, Jehovah, art on high for evermore.",
  "9": "For lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.",
  "10": "But my horn shalt thou exalt like a buffalo's: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.",
  "11": "And mine eye shall see [its desire] on mine enemies; mine ears shall hear [it] of the evil-doers that rise up against me.",
  "12": "The righteous shall shoot forth like a palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar on Lebanon.",
  "13": "Those that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God:",
  "14": "They are still vigorous in old age, they are full of sap and green;",
  "15": "To shew that Jehovah is upright: [he is] my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
