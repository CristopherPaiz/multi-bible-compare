  "1": "{A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.} Lord, *thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.",
  "2": "Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God.",
  "3": "Thou makest [mortal] man to return to dust, and sayest, Return, children of men.",
  "4": "For a thousand years, in thy sight, are as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night.",
  "5": "Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep: in the morning they are like grass [that] groweth up:",
  "6": "In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth.",
  "7": "For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy fury are we troubled.",
  "8": "Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.",
  "9": "For all our days pass away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a [passing] thought.",
  "10": "The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if, by reason of strength, they be fourscore years, yet their pride is labour and vanity, for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.",

  "16": "Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy majesty unto their sons.",
  "17": "And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it."
