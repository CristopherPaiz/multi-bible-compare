  "1": "{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands.",
  "2": "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.",
  "3": "There is no speech and there are no words, yet their voice is heard.",
  "4": "Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their language to the extremity of the world. In them hath he set a tent for the sun,",
  "5": "And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race.",
  "6": "His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.",
  "7": "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple;",
  "8": "The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes;",
  "9": "The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether:",
  "10": "They are more precious than gold, yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey and the dropping of the honeycomb.",
  "11": "Moreover, by them is thy servant enlightened; in keeping them there is great reward.",
  "12": "Who understandeth [his] errors? Purify me from secret [faults].",
  "13": "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous [sins]; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect, and I shall be innocent from great transgression.",
  "14": "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer."
