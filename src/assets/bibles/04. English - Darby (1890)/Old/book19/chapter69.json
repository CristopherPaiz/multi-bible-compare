  "1": "{To the chief Musician. Upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.} Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto [my] soul.",
  "2": "I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of waters, and the flood overfloweth me.",
  "3": "I am weary with my crying, my throat is parched; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.",
  "4": "They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.",
  "5": "Thou, O God, knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hidden from thee.",
  "6": "Let not them that wait on thee, Lord, Jehovah of hosts, be ashamed through me; let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel.",
  "7": "Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.",
  "8": "I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons;",
  "9": "For the zeal of thy house hath devoured me, and the reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.",
  "10": "And I wept, my soul was fasting: that also was to my reproach;",
  "11": "And I made sackcloth my garment: then I became a proverb to them.",
  "12": "They that sit in the gate talk of me, and [I am] the song of the drunkards.",
  "13": "But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy loving-kindness answer me, according to the truth of thy salvation:",
  "14": "Deliver me out of the mire, let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters.",
  "15": "Let not the flood of waters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.",
  "16": "Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy loving-kindness is good: according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, turn toward me;",
  "17": "And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: answer me speedily.",
  "18": "Draw nigh unto my soul, be its redeemer; ransom me because of mine enemies.",
  "19": "*Thou* knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.",
  "20": "Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am overwhelmed: and I looked for sympathy, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.",
  "21": "Yea, they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.",
  "22": "Let their table become a snare before them, and their very welfare a trap;",
  "23": "Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and make their loins continually to shake.",
  "24": "Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger take hold of them.",
  "25": "Let their habitation be desolate; let there be no dweller in their tents.",
  "26": "For they persecute him whom *thou* hast smitten, and they talk for the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.",
  "27": "Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.",
  "28": "Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.",
  "29": "But I am afflicted and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me secure on high.",
  "30": "I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving;",
  "31": "And it shall please Jehovah more than an ox, a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs.",
  "32": "The meek shall see it, they shall be glad; ye that seek God, your heart shall live.",
  "33": "For Jehovah heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners.",
  "34": "Let heavens and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moveth therein.",
  "35": "For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it:",
  "36": "And the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein."
