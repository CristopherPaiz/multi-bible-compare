  "1": "{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} In thee, Jehovah, do I trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.",

  "8": "And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large place.",
  "9": "Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am in trouble: mine eye wasteth away with vexation, my soul and my belly.",
  "10": "For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength faileth through mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted.",
  "11": "More than to all mine oppressors, I am become exceedingly a reproach, even to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that see me without flee from me.",
  "12": "I am forgotten in [their] heart as a dead man; I am become like a broken vessel.",

  "20": "Thou keepest them concealed in the secret of thy presence from the conspiracies of man; thou hidest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.",
  "21": "Blessed be Jehovah; for he hath shewn me wondrously his loving-kindness in a strong city.",
  "22": "As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.",
  "23": "Love Jehovah, all ye his saints. Jehovah preserveth the faithful, and plentifully requiteth the proud doer.",
  "24": "Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah."
