  "1": "{To the chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. An instruction.} O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, the work thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old:",
  "2": "Thou, by thy hand, didst dispossess the nations, but them thou didst plant; thou didst afflict the peoples, but them didst thou cause to spread out.",
  "3": "For not by their own sword did they take possession of the land, neither did their own arm save them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst delight in them.",
  "4": "Thou thyself art my king, O God: command deliverance for Jacob.",
  "5": "Through thee will we push down our adversaries; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.",
  "6": "For I will not put confidence in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.",
  "7": "For thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.",
  "8": "In God will we boast all the day, and we will praise thy name for ever. Selah.",
  "9": "But thou hast cast off, and put us to confusion, and dost not go forth with our armies;",
  "10": "Thou hast made us to turn back from the adversary, and they that hate us spoil for themselves;",
  "11": "Thou hast given us over like sheep [appointed] for meat, and hast scattered us among the nations;",
  "12": "Thou hast sold thy people for nought, and hast not increased [thy wealth] by their price;",
  "13": "Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a mockery and a derision for them that are round about us;",
  "14": "Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.",
  "15": "All the day my confusion is before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,",
  "16": "Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger.",
  "17": "All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely against thy covenant:",
  "18": "Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy path;",
  "19": "Though thou hast crushed us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.",
  "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God, and stretched out our hands to a strange God,",
  "21": "Would not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.",
  "22": "But for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter.",
  "23": "Awake, why sleepest thou, Lord? arise, cast [us] not off for ever.",
  "24": "Wherefore hidest thou thy face, [and] forgettest our affliction and our oppression?",
  "25": "For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth.",
  "26": "Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy loving-kindness' sake.",
