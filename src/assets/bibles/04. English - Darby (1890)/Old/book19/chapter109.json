  "1": "{To the chief Musician. Of David. A Psalm.} O God of my praise, be not silent:",
  "2": "For the mouth of the wicked [man] and the mouth of deceit are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue,",
  "3": "And with words of hatred have they encompassed me; and they fight against me without a cause.",
  "4": "For my love they are mine adversaries; but I [give myself unto] prayer.",
  "5": "And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.",
  "6": "Set a wicked [man] over him, and let [the] adversary stand at his right hand;",
  "7": "When he shall be judged, let him go out guilty, and let his prayer become sin;",
  "8": "Let his days be few, let another take his office;",
  "9": "Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow;",
  "10": "Let his sons be vagabonds and beg, and let them seek [their bread] far from their desolate places;",
  "11": "Let the usurer cast the net over all that he hath, and let strangers despoil his labour;",
  "12": "Let there be none to extend kindness unto him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children;",
  "13": "Let his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be blotted out:",
  "14": "Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out;",
  "15": "Let them be before Jehovah continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth:",
  "16": "Because he remembered not to shew kindness, but persecuted the afflicted and needy man, and the broken in heart, to slay him.",
  "17": "And he loved cursing; so let it come unto him. And he delighted not in blessing; and let it be far from him.",
  "18": "And he clothed himself with cursing like his vestment; so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones;",
  "19": "Let it be unto him as a garment with which he covereth himself, and for a girdle wherewith he is constantly girded.",
  "20": "Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul.",
  "21": "But do *thou* for me, Jehovah, Lord, for thy name's sake; because thy loving-kindness is good, deliver me:",
  "22": "For I am afflicted and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.",
  "23": "I am gone like a shadow when it lengtheneth; I am tossed about like the locust;",
  "24": "My knees are failing through fasting, and my flesh hath lost its fatness;",
  "25": "And I am become a reproach unto them; [when] they look upon me they shake their heads.",
  "26": "Help me, Jehovah my God; save me according to thy loving-kindness:",
  "27": "That they may know that this is thy hand; that *thou*, Jehovah, hast done it.",
  "28": "Let *them* curse, but bless *thou*; when they rise up, let them be ashamed, and let thy servant rejoice.",
  "29": "Let mine adversaries be clothed with confusion, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle.",
  "30": "I will greatly celebrate Jehovah with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.",
  "31": "For he standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those that judge his soul."
