  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} I will give thee thanks with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing psalms of thee.",
  "2": "I will bow down toward the temple of thy holiness, and celebrate thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.",
  "3": "In the day when I called thou answeredst me; thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.",
  "4": "All the kings of the earth shall celebrate thee, Jehovah, when they have heard the words of thy mouth;",
  "5": "And they shall sing in the ways of Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.",
  "6": "For Jehovah is high; but he looketh upon the lowly, and the proud he knoweth afar off.",
  "7": "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the anger of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.",
  "8": "Jehovah will perfect what concerneth me: thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, [endureth] for ever; forsake not the works of thine own hands."
