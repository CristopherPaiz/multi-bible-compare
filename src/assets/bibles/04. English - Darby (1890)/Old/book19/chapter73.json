  "1": "{A Psalm of Asaph.} Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure heart.",
  "2": "But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped;",
  "3": "For I was envious at the arrogant, seeing the prosperity of the wicked.",
  "4": "For they have no pangs in their death, and their body is well nourished;",
  "5": "They have not the hardships of mankind, neither are they plagued like [other] men:",
  "6": "Therefore pride encompasseth them as a neck-chain, violence covereth them [as] a garment;",
  "7": "Their eyes stand out from fatness, they exceed the imaginations of their heart:",
  "8": "They mock and speak wickedly of oppression, they speak loftily:",
  "9": "They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.",
  "10": "Therefore his people turn hither, and waters in fulness are wrung out to them.",
  "11": "And they say, How can God know, and is there knowledge in the Most High?",
  "12": "Behold, these are the wicked, and they prosper in the world: they heap up riches.",
  "13": "Truly have I purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency:",
  "14": "For all the day have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.",
  "15": "If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I should be faithless to the generation of thy children.",
  "16": "When I thought to be able to know this, it was a grievous task in mine eyes;",
  "17": "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; [then] understood I their end.",
  "18": "Truly thou settest them in slippery places, thou castest them down in ruins.",
  "19": "How are they suddenly made desolate! they pass away, consumed with terrors.",
  "20": "As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image.",
  "21": "When my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins,",
  "22": "Then I was brutish and knew nothing; I was [as] a beast with thee.",
  "23": "Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand;",
  "24": "Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel, and after the glory, thou wilt receive me.",
  "25": "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee.",
  "26": "My flesh and my heart faileth: God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.",
  "27": "For behold, they that are far from thee shall perish; thou destroyest every one that goeth a whoring from thee.",
  "28": "But as for me, it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, that I may declare all thy works."
