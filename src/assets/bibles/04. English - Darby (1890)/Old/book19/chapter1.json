  "1": "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners;",
  "2": "But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.",
  "3": "And he [is] as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth.",
  "4": "The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff which the wind driveth away.",
  "5": "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.",
  "6": "For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish."
