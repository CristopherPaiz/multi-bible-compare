  "1": "{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known [me].",
  "2": "*Thou* knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off;",
  "3": "Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways;",
  "4": "For there is not yet a word on my tongue, [but] lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.",
  "5": "Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me.",
  "6": "O knowledge too wonderful for me! it is high, I cannot [attain] unto it.",
  "7": "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and whither flee from thy presence?",
  "8": "If I ascend up into the heavens thou art there; or if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou [art there];",
  "9": "[If] I take the wings of the dawn [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,",
  "10": "Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.",
  "11": "And if I say, Surely darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night;",
  "12": "Even darkness hideth not from thee, and the night shineth as the day: the darkness is as the light.",
  "13": "For thou hast possessed my reins; thou didst cover me in my mother's womb.",
  "14": "I will praise thee, for I am fearfully, wonderfully made. Marvellous are thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth right well.",
  "15": "My bones were not hidden from thee when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth.",
  "16": "Thine eyes did see my unformed substance, and in thy book all [my members] were written; [during many] days were they fashioned, when [as yet] there was none of them.",
  "17": "But how precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!",
  "18": "[If] I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.",
  "19": "Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O God! And ye men of blood, depart from me.",
  "20": "For they speak of thee wickedly, they take [thy name] in vain, thine enemies.",
  "21": "Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? and do not I loathe them that rise up against thee?",
  "22": "I hate them with perfect hatred; I account them mine enemies.",
  "23": "Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts;",
  "24": "And see if there be any grievous way in me; and lead me in the way everlasting."
