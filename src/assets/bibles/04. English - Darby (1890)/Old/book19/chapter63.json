  "1": "{A Psalm of David; when he was in the wilderness of Judah.} O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh languisheth for thee, in a dry and weary land without water:",
  "2": "To see thy power and thy glory, as I have beheld thee in the sanctuary;",
  "3": "For thy loving-kindness is better than life: my lips shall praise thee.",
  "4": "So will I bless thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in thy name.",
  "5": "My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise [thee] with joyful lips.",
  "6": "When I remember thee upon my bed, I meditate on thee in the night-watches:",
  "7": "For thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings will I sing for joy.",
  "8": "My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.",
  "9": "But those that seek my soul, to destroy [it], shall go into the lower parts of the earth;",
  "10": "They shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be the portion of foxes.",
  "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.",
  "12": ""
