  "1": "{An instruction. Of Asaph.} Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.",
  "2": "I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter riddles from of old,",
  "3": "Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us:",
  "4": "We will not hide [them] from their sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done.",
  "5": "For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;",
  "6": "That the generation to come might know [them], the children that should be born; that they might rise up and tell [them] to their children,",
  "7": "And that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but observe his commandments;",
  "8": "And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not their heart, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.",
  "9": "The sons of Ephraim, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.",
  "10": "They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;",
  "11": "And forgot his doings, and his marvellous works which he had shewn them.",
  "12": "In the sight of their fathers had he done wonders, in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan.",
  "13": "He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and made the waters to stand as a heap;",
  "14": "And he led them with a cloud in the daytime, and all the night with the light of fire.",
  "15": "He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as out of the depths, abundantly;",
  "16": "And he brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.",
  "17": "Yet they still went on sinning against him, provoking the Most High in the desert;",
  "18": "And they tempted God in their heart, by asking meat for their lust;",
  "19": "And they spoke against God: they said, Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness?",
  "20": "Behold, he smote the rock, and waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; is he able to give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?",
  "21": "Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel:",
  "22": "Because they believed not in God, and confided not in his salvation;",
  "23": "Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens,",
  "24": "And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the corn of the heavens.",
  "25": "Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he sent them provision to the full.",
  "26": "He caused the east wind to rise in the heavens, and by his strength he brought the south wind;",
  "27": "And he rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas,",
  "28": "And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations:",
  "29": "And they did eat, and were well filled; for that they lusted after, he brought to them.",
  "30": "They were not alienated from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,",
  "31": "When the anger of God went up against them; and he slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.",
  "32": "For all this, they sinned still, and believed not in his marvellous works;",
  "33": "And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.",
  "34": "When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and sought early after God;",
  "35": "And they remembered that God was their rock, and God, the Most High, their redeemer.",
  "36": "But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue;",
  "37": "For their heart was not firm toward him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.",
  "38": "But he was merciful: he forgave the iniquity, and destroyed [them] not; but many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his fury:",
  "39": "And he remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passeth away and cometh not again.",
  "40": "How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!",
  "41": "And they turned again and tempted God, and grieved the Holy One of Israel.",
  "42": "They remembered not his hand, the day when he delivered them from the oppressor,",
  "43": "How he set his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the field of Zoan;",
  "44": "And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink;",
  "45": "He sent dog-flies among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them;",
  "46": "And he gave their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust;",
  "47": "He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with hail-stones;",
  "48": "And he delivered up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.",
  "49": "He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and distress, a mission of angels of woes.",
  "50": "He made a way for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;",
  "51": "And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham.",
  "52": "And he made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;",
  "53": "And he led them safely, so that they were without fear; and the sea covered their enemies.",
  "54": "And he brought them to his holy border, this mountain, which his right hand purchased;",
  "55": "And he drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.",
  "56": "But they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not his testimonies,",
  "57": "And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow.",
  "58": "And they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.",
  "59": "God heard, and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:",
  "60": "And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men,",
  "61": "And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor;",
  "62": "And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance:",
  "63": "The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not praised in [nuptial] song;",
  "64": "Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.",
  "65": "Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine;",
  "66": "And he smote his adversaries in the hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach.",
  "67": "And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,",
  "68": "But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;",
  "69": "And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.",
  "70": "And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:",
  "71": "From following the suckling-ewes, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.",
  "72": "And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands."
