  "16": "And they envied Moses in the camp, [and] Aaron, the saint of Jehovah.",
  "17": "The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram;",

  "25": "But murmured in their tents: they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.",
  "26": "And he lifted up his hand to them, that he would make them fall in the wilderness;",
  "27": "And that he would make their seed fall among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.",
  "28": "And they joined themselves unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead;",
  "29": "And they provoked [him] to anger with their doings; and a plague broke out among them.",
  "30": "Then stood up Phinehas and executed judgment, and the plague was stayed;",
  "31": "And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, from generation to generation, for evermore.",
  "32": "And they moved him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;",

  "45": "And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses;",
  "46": "And he caused them to find compassion of all those that had carried them captives.",
  "47": "Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.",
  "48": "Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!"
