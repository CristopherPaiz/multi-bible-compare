  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have confided in Jehovah: I shall not slip.",
  "2": "Prove me, Jehovah, and test me; try my reins and my heart:",
  "3": "For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.",
  "4": "I have not sat with vain persons, neither have I gone in with dissemblers;",
  "5": "I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and I have not sat with the wicked.",
  "6": "I will wash my hands in innocency, and will encompass thine altar, O Jehovah,",
  "7": "That I may cause the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and declare all thy marvellous works.",
  "8": "Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.",
  "9": "Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;",
  "10": "In whose hands are evil devices, and their right hand is full of bribes.",
  "11": "But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity. Redeem me, and be gracious unto me.",
  "12": "My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless Jehovah."
