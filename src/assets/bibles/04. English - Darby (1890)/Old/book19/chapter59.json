  "3": "For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; strong ones are gathered against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.",
  "4": "They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault: awake to meet me, and behold.",
  "5": "Yea, do thou, Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations: be not gracious to any plotters of iniquity. Selah.",
