  "1": "{A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness?",
  "2": "He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his heart.",
  "3": "[He that] slandereth not with his tongue, doeth not evil to his companion, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;",
  "4": "In whose eyes the depraved person is contemned, and who honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have sworn to his own hurt, changeth it not;",
  "5": "[He that] putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these [things] shall never be moved."
