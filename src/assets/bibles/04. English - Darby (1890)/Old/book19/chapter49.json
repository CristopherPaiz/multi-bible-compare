  "1": "{To the chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.} Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world:",
  "2": "Both men of low and men of high degree, rich and poor alike.",
  "3": "My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding:",
  "4": "I will incline mine ear to a parable, I will open my riddle upon the harp.",
  "5": "Wherefore should I fear in the days of adversity, [when] the iniquity of my supplanters encompasseth me?",
  "6": "They depend upon their wealth, and boast themselves in the abundance of their riches.",
  "7": "None can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,",
  "8": "(For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be given up for ever,)",
  "9": "That he should still live perpetually, [and] not see corruption.",
  "10": "For he seeth that wise men die; all alike, the fool and the brutish perish, and they leave their wealth to others.",
  "11": "Their inward thought is, that their houses are for ever, their dwelling-places from generation to generation: they call the lands after their own names.",
  "12": "Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.",
  "13": "This their way is their folly, yet they that come after them delight in their sayings. Selah.",
  "14": "Like sheep are they laid in Sheol: Death feedeth on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their comeliness shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for them.",
  "15": "But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he will receive me. Selah.",
  "16": "Be not afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased:",
  "17": "For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.",
  "18": "Though he blessed his soul in his lifetime, and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself,",
  "19": "It shall go to the generation of his fathers: they shall never see light.",
  "20": "Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish."
