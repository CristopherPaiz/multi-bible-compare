  "1": "{A Song of degrees. Of David.} If it had not been Jehovah who was for us oh let Israel say",
  "2": "If it had not been Jehovah who was for us, when men rose up against us,",
  "3": "Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;",
  "4": "Then the waters had overwhelmed us, a torrent had gone over our soul;",
  "5": "Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.",
  "6": "Blessed be Jehovah, who gave us not up a prey to their teeth!",
  "7": "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped.",
  "8": "Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the maker of heavens and earth."
