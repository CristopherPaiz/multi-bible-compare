  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, and be not envious of them that work unrighteousness;",
  "2": "for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and fade as the green herb.",
  "3": "Confide in Jehovah, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness;",
  "4": "and delight thyself in Jehovah, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart.",
  "5": "Commit thy way unto Jehovah, and rely upon him: he will bring [it] to pass;",
  "6": "and he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.",
  "7": "Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him that prospereth in his way, because of the man that bringeth mischievous devices to pass.",
  "8": "Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself: it [would be] only to do evil.",
  "9": "For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait on Jehovah, they shall possess the land.",
  "10": "For yet a little while, and the wicked is not; and thou considerest his place, but he is not.",
  "11": "But the meek shall possess the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of prosperity.",
  "12": "The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth his teeth against him.",
  "13": "The Lord laugheth at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.",
  "14": "The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the afflicted and needy, to slay those that are upright in [the] way:",
  "15": "their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.",
  "16": "The little that the righteous hath is better than the abundance of many wicked;",
  "17": "for the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.",
  "18": "Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever:",
  "19": "they shall not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.",
  "20": "For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume, like smoke shall they consume away.",
  "21": "The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; but the righteous is gracious and giveth:",
  "22": "for those blessed of him shall possess the land, and they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.",
  "23": "The steps of a man are established by Jehovah, and he delighteth in his way:",
  "24": "though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for Jehovah upholdeth his hand.",
  "25": "I have been young, and now am old, and I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread:",
  "26": "all the day he is gracious and lendeth, and his seed shall be a blessing.",
  "27": "Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore;",
  "28": "for Jehovah loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: They are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.",
  "29": "The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell therein for ever.",
  "30": "The mouth of the righteous proffereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment;",
  "31": "the law of his God is in his heart; his goings shall not slide.",
  "32": "The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him:",
  "33": "Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.",
  "34": "Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to possess the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see [it].",
  "35": "I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading like a green tree in its native soil:",
  "36": "but he passed away, and behold, he was not; and I sought him, but he was not found.",
  "37": "Mark the perfect, and behold the upright, for the end of [that] man is peace;",
  "38": "but the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.",
  "39": "But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: he is their strength in the time of trouble.",
  "40": "And Jehovah will help them and deliver them: he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them; for they trust in him.",
  "41": ""
