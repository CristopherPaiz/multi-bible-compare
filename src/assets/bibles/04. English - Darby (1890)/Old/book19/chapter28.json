  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} Unto thee, Jehovah, do I call; my rock, be not silent unto me, lest, [if] thou keep silence toward me, I become like them that go down into the pit.",
  "2": "Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy holiness.",
  "3": "Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, and mischief is in their heart.",
  "4": "Give them according to their doing, and according to the wickedness of their deeds; give them after the work of their hands, render to them their desert.",
  "5": "For they regard not the deeds of Jehovah, nor the work of his hands: he will destroy them, and not build them up.",
  "6": "Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications.",
  "7": "Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart confided in him, and I was helped: therefore my heart exulteth, and with my song will I praise him.",
  "8": "Jehovah is their strength; and he is the stronghold of salvation to his anointed one.",
  "9": "Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; and feed them, and lift them up for ever."
