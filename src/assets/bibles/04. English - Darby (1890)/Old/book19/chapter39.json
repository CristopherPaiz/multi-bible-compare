  "1": "{To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.} I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is before me.",
  "2": "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace from good; and my sorrow was stirred.",
  "3": "My heart burned within me; the fire was kindled in my musing: I spoke with my tongue,",
  "4": "Make me to know, Jehovah, mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I shall know how frail I am.",
  "5": "Behold, thou hast made my days [as] hand-breadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before thee; verily, every man, [even] the high placed, is altogether vanity. Selah.",
  "6": "Verily, man walketh in a vain show; verily they are disquieted in vain; he heapeth up [riches], and knoweth not who shall gather them.",
  "7": "And now, what wait I for, Lord? my hope is in thee.",
  "8": "Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.",
  "9": "I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; for *thou* hast done [it].",
  "10": "Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.",
  "11": "When thou with rebukes dost correct a man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely, every man is vanity. Selah.",
  "12": "Hear my prayer, Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; be not silent at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, like all my fathers.",
