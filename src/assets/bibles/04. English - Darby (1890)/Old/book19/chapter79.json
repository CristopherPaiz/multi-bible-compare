  "1": "{A Psalm of Asaph.} O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.",
  "2": "The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowl of the heavens, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth:",
  "3": "Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury [them].",
  "4": "We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a mockery and a derision to them that are round about us.",
  "5": "How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out thy fury upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name:",
  "7": "For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.",
  "8": "Remember not against us the iniquities of [our] forefathers; let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us: for we are brought very low.",
  "9": "Help us, O God of our salvation, because of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake.",
  "10": "Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants that is shed be known among the nations in our sight.",
  "11": "Let the groaning of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm, preserve those that are appointed to die;",
  "12": "And render unto our neighbours, sevenfold into their bosom, their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.",
  "13": "And we, thy people and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks unto thee for ever; we will shew forth thy praise from generation to generation."
