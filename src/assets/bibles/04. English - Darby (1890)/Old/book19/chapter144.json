  "1": "{[A Psalm] of David.} Blessed be Jehovah my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight;",
  "2": "My mercy and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdueth my people under me!",
  "3": "Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him, the son of man, that thou takest thought of him?",
  "4": "Man is like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away.",
  "5": "Jehovah, bow thy heavens, and come down; touch the mountains, that they smoke;",
  "6": "Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; send forth thine arrows, and discomfit them:",
  "7": "Stretch out thy hands from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of aliens,",
  "8": "Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "9": "O God, I will sing a new song unto thee; with the ten-stringed lute will I sing psalms unto thee:",
  "10": "Who givest salvation unto kings; who rescuest David thy servant from the hurtful sword.",
  "11": "Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
  "12": "That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the fashion of a palace:",
  "13": "Our granaries full, affording all manner of store; our sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in our pastures;",
  "14": "Our kine laden [with young]; no breaking in and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets.",
  "15": "Blessed the people that is in such a case! Blessed the people whose God is Jehovah!"
