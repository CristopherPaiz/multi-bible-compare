  "1": "Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Jehovah my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with majesty and splendour;",
  "2": "Covering thyself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent-curtain;",
  "3": "Who layeth the beams of his upper chambers in the waters, who maketh clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind;",
  "4": "Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flame of fire.",
  "5": "He laid the earth upon its foundations: it shall not be removed for ever.",
  "6": "Thou hadst covered it with the deep, as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains:",
  "7": "At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away;",
  "8": "The mountains rose, the valleys sank, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them;",
  "9": "Thou hast set a bound which they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.",
  "10": "He sendeth the springs into the valleys: they run among the mountains;",
  "11": "They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.",
  "12": "The birds of heaven dwell by them; they give forth their voice from among the branches.",
  "13": "He watereth the mountains from his upper-chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.",
  "14": "He maketh the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; bringing forth bread out of the earth,",
  "15": "And wine which gladdeneth the heart of man; making [his] face shine with oil; and with bread he strengtheneth man's heart.",
  "16": "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,",
  "17": "Where the birds make their nests; [as for] the stork, the fir trees are her house.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs, a refuge for the rock-badgers.",
  "19": "He made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth its going down.",
  "20": "Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth:",
  "21": "The young lions roar after the prey, and to seek their food from God.",
  "22": "The sun ariseth, they retreat, and lay them down in their dens.",
  "23": "Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.",
  "24": "How manifold are thy works, O Jehovah! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.",
  "25": "Yonder is the great and wide sea: therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great.",
  "26": "There go the ships; [there] that leviathan, which thou hast formed to play therein.",
  "27": "These all look unto thee, that thou mayest give their food in its season:",
  "28": "That thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.",
  "29": "Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath, they expire and return to their dust.",
  "30": "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth.",
  "31": "The glory of Jehovah will endure for ever; Jehovah will rejoice in his works.",
  "32": "He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live; I will sing psalms to my God while I have my being.",
  "34": "My meditation shall be pleasant unto him; I will rejoice in Jehovah.",
  "35": "Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked shall be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Hallelujah!"
