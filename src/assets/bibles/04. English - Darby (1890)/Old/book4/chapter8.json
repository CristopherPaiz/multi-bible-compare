  "25": "And from fifty years old he shall retire from the labour of the service, and shall serve no more;",
  "26": "but he shall minister with his brethren in the tent of meeting, and keep the charge, but he shall not serve [in] the service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites with regard to their charges."
