  "1": "And it came to pass that when the people murmured, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed [some] in the extremity of the camp.",
  "2": "And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah and the fire abated.",
  "3": "And they called the name of that place Taberah; because a fire of Jehovah burned among them.",
  "4": "And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who will give us flesh to eat?",
  "5": "We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;",
  "6": "and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes.",
  "7": "And the manna was as coriander seed, and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium.",
  "8": "The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it with hand-mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of oil-cakes.",
  "9": "And when the dew fell upon the camp by night, the manna fell upon it.",
  "10": "And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every one at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; it was also evil in the eyes of Moses.",
  "11": "And Moses said to Jehovah, Why hast thou done evil to thy servant, and why have I not found favour in thine eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?",
  "12": "Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them forth, that thou sayest to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the nursing-father beareth the suckling, unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers?",
  "13": "Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat!",
  "14": "I am not able to bear all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me.",
  "15": "And if thou deal thus with me, slay me, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, that I may not behold my wretchedness.",
  "16": "And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and their officers; and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee.",
  "17": "And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it alone.",
  "18": "And unto the people shalt thou say, Hallow yourselves for to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt; and Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.",
  "19": "Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;",
  "20": "[but] for a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?",
  "21": "And Moses said, The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou sayest, I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month.",
  "22": "Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice them?",
  "23": "And Jehovah said to Moses, Hath Jehovah's hand become short? Now shalt thou see whether my word will come to pass unto thee or not.",
  "24": "And Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah; and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.",
  "25": "And Jehovah came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders; and it came to pass, that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not repeat [it].",
  "26": "And two men remained in the camp, the name of the one, Eldad, and the name of the other, Medad; and the Spirit rested upon them (and they were among them that were written, but they had not gone out to the tent); and they prophesied in the camp.",
  "27": "And there ran a youth, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.",
  "28": "And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them!",
  "29": "But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, [and] that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!",
  "30": "And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.",
  "31": "And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and drove quails from the sea, and cast them about the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the earth.",
  "32": "And the people rose up all that day, and the whole night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered little gathered ten homers; and they spread them abroad for themselves round about the camp.",
  "33": "The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, when the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.",
  "34": "And they called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they buried the people who lusted.",
  "35": "From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they were at Hazeroth."
