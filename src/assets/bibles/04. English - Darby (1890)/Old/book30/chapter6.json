  "3": "Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;",
  "4": "that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves from the midst of the stall;",
  "5": "that chant to the sound of the lute, [and] invent them instruments of music, like David;",
  "6": "that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but are not grieved for the breach of Joseph.",

  "14": "For behold, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah the God of hosts, I will raise up against you a nation; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the torrent of the Arabah."
