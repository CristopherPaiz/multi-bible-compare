  "1": "The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the prophecy uttered by the man unto Ithiel, [even] unto Ithiel and Ucal:",
  "2": "Truly *I* am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence.",
  "3": "I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy.",
  "4": "Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in a mantle? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?",
  "5": "Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.",
  "6": "Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.",
  "7": "Two things do I ask of thee; deny me [them] not before I die:",
  "8": "Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my daily need:",
  "9": "lest I be full and deny [thee], and say, Who is Jehovah? or lest I be poor and steal, and outrage the name of my God.",
  "10": "Speak not too much about a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.",
  "11": "There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother;",
  "12": "there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not washed from their filthiness;",
  "13": "there is a generation, how lofty are their eyes, how their eyelids are lifted up!",
  "14": "a generation whose teeth are swords, and their jaw-teeth knives, to devour the afflicted from off the earth, and the needy from [among] men.",
  "15": "The leech hath two daughters: Give, give. There are three [things] never satisfied; four which say not, It is enough:",
  "16": "Sheol, and the barren womb; the earth which is not filled with water, and the fire which saith not, It is enough.",
  "17": "The eye that mocketh at a father, and despiseth to obey a mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.",
  "18": "There are three [things] too wonderful for me, and four that I know not:",
  "19": "The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid.",
  "20": "Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.",
  "21": "Under three [things] the earth is disquieted, and under four it cannot bear up:",
  "22": "Under a servant when he reigneth, and a churl when he is filled with meat;",
  "23": "under an odious [woman] when she is married, and a handmaid when she is heir to her mistress.",
  "24": "There are four [things] little upon the earth, and they are exceeding wise:",
  "25": "The ants, a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;",
  "26": "the rock-badgers are but a feeble folk, yet they make their house in the cliff;",
  "27": "the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands;",
  "28": "thou takest hold of the lizard with the hands, yet is she in kings' palaces.",
  "29": "There are three [things] which have a stately step, and four are comely in going:",
  "30": "The lion, mighty among beasts, which turneth not away for any;",
  "31": "a [horse] girt in the loins; or the he-goat; and a king, against whom none can rise up.",
  "32": "If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, [lay] the hand upon thy mouth.",
  "33": "For the pressing of milk bringeth forth butter, and the pressing of the nose bringeth forth blood; and the pressing of anger bringeth forth strife."
