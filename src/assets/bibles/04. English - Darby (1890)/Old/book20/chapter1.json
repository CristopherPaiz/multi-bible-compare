  "1": "Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:",
  "2": "to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;",
  "3": "to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;",
  "4": "to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.",
  "5": "He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:",
  "6": "to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.",
  "7": "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
  "8": "Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;",
  "9": "for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.",
  "10": "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.",
  "11": "If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;",
  "12": "let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;",
  "13": "we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:",
  "14": "cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:",
  "15": "my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;",
  "16": "for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.",
  "17": "For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.",
  "18": "And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.",
  "19": "So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.",
  "20": "Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;",
  "21": "she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:",
  "22": "How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?",
  "23": "Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.",
  "24": "Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;",
  "25": "and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:",
  "26": "I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;",
  "27": "when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:",
  "28": "then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.",
  "29": "Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;",
  "30": "they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:",
  "31": "therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.",
  "32": "For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.",
  "33": "But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil."
