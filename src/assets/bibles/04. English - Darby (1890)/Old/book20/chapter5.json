  "1": "My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my understanding;",
  "2": "that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may preserve knowledge.",
  "3": "For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;",
  "4": "but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.",
  "6": "Lest she should ponder the path of life, her ways wander, she knoweth not [whither].",
  "7": "And now, children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.",
  "8": "Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:",
  "9": "lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;",
  "10": "lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and the fruits of thy toil [come] into the house of a stranger;",
  "11": "and thou mourn in thine end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed;",
  "12": "and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!",
  "13": "and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to those that instructed me;",
  "14": "I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.",
  "15": "Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.",
  "16": "Thy fountains shall be poured forth, as water-brooks in the broadways.",
  "17": "Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.",
  "18": "Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.",
  "19": "As a lovely hind and a graceful roe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times: be thou ravished continually with her love.",
  "20": "And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?",
  "21": "For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he pondereth all his paths.",
  "22": "His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.",
  "23": "He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray."
