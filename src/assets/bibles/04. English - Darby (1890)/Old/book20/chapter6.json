  "1": "My son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger,",
  "2": "thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.",
  "3": "Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou hast come into the hand of thy friend: go, humble thyself, and be urgent with thy friend.",
  "4": "Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids:",
  "5": "deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise:",
  "7": "which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,",
  "8": "provideth her bread in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.",
  "9": "How long, sluggard, wilt thou lie down? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest!",
  "11": "So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man.",
  "12": "A man of Belial, a wicked person, is he that goeth about with a perverse mouth;",
  "13": "he winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;",
  "14": "deceits are in his heart; he deviseth mischief at all times, he soweth discords.",
  "15": "Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly: in a moment shall he be broken, and without remedy.",
  "16": "These six [things] doth Jehovah hate, yea, seven are an abomination unto him:",
  "17": "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;",
  "18": "a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations; feet that are swift in running to mischief;",
  "19": "a false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discords among brethren.",
  "20": "My son, observe thy father's commandment, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;",
  "21": "bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck:",
  "22": "when thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.",
  "23": "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:",
  "24": "to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.",
  "25": "Lust not after her beauty in thy heart, neither let her take thee with her eyelids;",
  "26": "for by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a loaf of bread, and another's wife doth hunt for the precious soul.",
  "27": "Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his garments not be burned?",
  "28": "Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?",
  "29": "So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife: whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.",
  "30": "They do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry:",
  "31": "and if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.",
  "32": "Whoso committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.",
  "33": "A wound and contempt shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.",
  "34": "For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance;",
  "35": "he will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content though thou multipliest [thy] gifts."
