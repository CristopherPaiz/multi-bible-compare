  "1": "And it came to pass when the whole nation had completely gone over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,",

  "7": "then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.",

  "9": "And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day.",
  "10": "And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and passed over.",

  "12": "And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, went over in array before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.",

  "14": "On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.",

  "16": "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.",
  "17": "And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.",
  "18": "And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, [when] the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on to the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and they flowed as previously, over all its banks.",

  "22": "then ye shall let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel come over this Jordan;",
  "23": "because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;",
  "24": "that all peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye might fear Jehovah your God continually."
