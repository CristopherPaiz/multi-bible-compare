  "8": "And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward, and smote them until none were left remaining to them.",
  "9": "And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had said to him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.",
  "10": "And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword; for Hazor was in times past the head of all those kingdoms.",
