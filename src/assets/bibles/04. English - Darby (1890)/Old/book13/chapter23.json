  "11": "And Jahath was the head, and Ziza the second; and Jeush and Beriah had not many sons: as father's house, therefore, they were reckoned as one.",
  "12": "The sons of Kohath: Amram, Jizhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.",

  "24": "These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers' houses, the chief fathers, as they were reckoned, by number of names by their polls, who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.",
  "25": "For David said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people, and he will dwell in Jerusalem for ever;",
  "26": "and the Levites also have no more to carry the tabernacle, nor any of its vessels for its service.",
  "27": "For by the last words of David was this [done], the numbering of the sons of Levi from twenty years old and upward.",

  "29": "and for the loaves to be set in rows, and for the fine flour for the oblation, and for the unleavened cakes, and for [what is baked in] the pan, and for that which is saturated [with oil], and for all measure of capacity and size;",
  "30": "and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;",
  "31": "and for all burnt-offerings offered up to Jehovah on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the ordinance concerning them, continually, before Jehovah;",
  "32": "and they kept the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of Jehovah."
