  "1": "A Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.",
  "2": "Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, [and] I feared. Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!",
  "3": "God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise.",
  "4": "And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.",
  "5": "Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at his feet.",
  "6": "He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting.",
  "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.",
  "8": "Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?",
  "9": "Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.",
  "10": "The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its hands on high.",
  "11": "The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth, At the shining of thy glittering spear.",
  "12": "Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.",
  "13": "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.",
  "14": "Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly.",
  "15": "Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap of great waters.",
  "16": "I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their invader shall come up against the people.",
  "17": "For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:",
  "18": "Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.",
  "19": "Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments."
