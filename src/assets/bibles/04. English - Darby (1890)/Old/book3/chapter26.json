  "13": "I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you walk upright.",
  "14": "But if ye hearken not unto me, and do not all these commandments,",
  "15": "and if ye shall despise my statutes, and if your soul shall abhor mine ordinances, so that ye do not all my commandments, that ye break my covenant,",
  "16": "I also will do this unto you I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and fever, which shall cause the eyes to fail, and the soul to waste away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.",
  "17": "And I will set my face against you, that ye may be routed before your enemies; they that hate you shall have dominion over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.",
  "18": "And if for this ye hearken not unto me, I will punish you sevenfold more for your sins,",
  "19": "and I will break the arrogance of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as bronze,",
  "20": "and your strength shall be spent in vain, and your land shall not yield its produce; and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.",
  "21": "And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring sevenfold more plagues upon you according to your sins.",
  "22": "And I will send the beasts of the field among you, that they may rob you of your children, and cut off your cattle, and make you few in number; and your streets shall be desolate.",

  "33": "And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and your cities waste.",
  "34": "Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.",
  "35": "All the days of the desolation it shall rest, [the days in] which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein.",
  "36": "And as to those that remain of you I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth;",
  "37": "and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.",
  "38": "And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.",
  "39": "And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.",
  "40": "And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto me,",
  "41": "so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,",
  "42": "I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.",
  "43": "For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.",
  "44": "And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God.",
  "45": "But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.",
  "46": "These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses."
