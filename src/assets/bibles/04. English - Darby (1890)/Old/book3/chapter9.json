  "4": "and a bullock and a ram for a peace-offering, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and an oblation mingled with oil; for to-day Jehovah will appear to you.",
  "5": "And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the assembly approached and stood before Jehovah.",
  "6": "And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded that ye should do; and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.",

  "8": "And Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin-offering which was for himself;",
  "9": "and the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.",
  "10": "And the fat, and the kidneys, and the net above the liver, of the sin-offering, he burned on the altar, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.",
  "11": "And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.",
  "12": "And he slaughtered the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about.",
  "13": "And they delivered the burnt-offering to him, in the pieces thereof, and the head; and he burned [them] on the altar.",
  "14": "And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burned [them] upon the burnt-offering, on the altar.",
  "15": "And he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people and slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, as the first.",
  "16": "And he presented the burnt-offering and offered it according to the ordinance.",
  "17": "And he presented the oblation, and took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.",
  "18": "And he slaughtered the bullock and the ram of the sacrifice of peace-offering which was for the people. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about;",
  "19": "and the pieces of fat of the bullock and of the ram, the fat tail and what covers [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the net of the liver;",
  "20": "and they put the pieces of fat on the breast-pieces, and he burned the pieces of fat on the altar;",
  "21": "and the breast-pieces and the right shoulder Aaron waved as a wave-offering before Jehovah, as Moses had commanded.",
  "22": "And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down after the offering of the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offering.",
  "23": "And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.",
  "24": "And there went out fire from before Jehovah, and consumed on the altar the burnt-offering, and the pieces of fat; and all the people saw it, and they shouted, and fell on their face."
