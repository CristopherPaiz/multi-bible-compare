  "8": "And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are they that shall go?",
  "9": "And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters; with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we have a feast of Jehovah.",

  "15": "And they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing on the trees, and in the herbs of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.",
  "16": "And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.",
  "17": "And now, forgive, I pray you, my sin only this time, and intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this death only!",

  "27": "But Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would not let them go.",
