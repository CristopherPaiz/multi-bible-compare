  "38": "And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks and herds very much cattle.",
  "39": "And they baked the dough that they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they were driven out of Egypt, and could not wait; neither had they prepared for themselves any food.",
