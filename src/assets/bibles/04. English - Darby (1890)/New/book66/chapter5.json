  "13": "And every creature which is in the heaven and upon the earth and under the earth, and [those that are] upon the sea, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honour, and glory, and might, to the ages of ages.",
  "14": "And the four living creatures said, Amen; and the elders fell down and did homage."
