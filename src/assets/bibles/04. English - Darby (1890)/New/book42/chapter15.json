  "1": "And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near to him to hear him;",
  "2": "and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This [man] receives sinners and eats with them.",
  "3": "And he spoke to them this parable, saying,",
  "4": "What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost, until he find it?",
  "5": "and having found it, he lays it upon his own shoulders, rejoicing;",
  "6": "and being come to the house, calls together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.",
  "7": "I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner, [more] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance.",
  "8": "Or, what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it?",
  "9": "and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.",
  "10": "Thus, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner.",
  "11": "And he said, A certain man had two sons;",
  "12": "and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give to me the share of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided to them what he was possessed of.",
  "13": "And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off, and there dissipated his property, living in debauchery.",
  "14": "But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.",
  "15": "And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.",
  "16": "And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating; and no one gave to him.",
  "17": "And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread, and *I* perish here by famine.",
  "18": "I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee;",
  "19": "I am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.",
  "20": "And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses.",
  "21": "And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.",
  "22": "But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;",
  "23": "and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:",

  "28": "But he became angry and would not go in. And his father went out and besought him.",
  "29": "But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends:",
  "30": "but when this thy son, who has devoured thy substance with harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.",
  "31": "But he said to him, Child, *thou* art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.",
  "32": "But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found."
