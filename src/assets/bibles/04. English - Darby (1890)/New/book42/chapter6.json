  "15": "[and] Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alphaeus and Simon who was called Zealot,",

  "41": "But why lookest thou on the mote which is in the eye of thy brother, but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye?",
  "42": "or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, allow [me], I will cast out the mote that is in thine eye, thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine eye?
