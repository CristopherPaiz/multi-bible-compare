  "1": "Now the feast of unleavened bread, which [is] called the passover, drew nigh,",
  "2": "and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.",
  "3": "And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariote, being of the number of the twelve.",
  "4": "And he went away and spoke with the chief priests and captains as to how he should deliver him up to them.",
  "5": "And they were rejoiced, and agreed to give him money.",
  "6": "And he came to an agreement to do it, and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them away from the crowd.",
  "7": "And the day of unleavened bread came, in which the passover was to be killed.",
  "8": "And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat [it].",
  "9": "But they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare [it]?",
  "10": "And he said to them, Behold, as ye enter into the city a man will meet you, carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in;",
  "11": "and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?",
  "12": "And *he* will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.",
  "13": "And having gone they found it as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.",
  "14": "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the [twelve] apostles with him.",
  "15": "And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.",
  "16": "For I say unto you, that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.",
  "17": "And having received a cup, when he had given thanks he said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.",
  "18": "For I say unto you, that I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come.",
  "19": "And having taken a loaf, when he had given thanks, he broke [it], and gave [it] to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.",
  "20": "In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.",
  "21": "Moreover, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up [is] with me on the table;",
  "22": "and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined, but woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up.",
  "23": "And *they* began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this.",
  "24": "And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be [the] greatest.",
  "25": "And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them, and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors.",
  "26": "But *ye* [shall] not [be] thus; but let the greater among you be as the younger, and the leader as he that serves.",
  "27": "For which [is] greater, he that is at table or he that serves? [Is] not he that is at table? But *I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves.",
  "28": "But *ye* are they who have persevered with me in my temptations.",
  "29": "And *I* appoint unto you, as my Father has appointed unto me, a kingdom,",
  "30": "that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
  "31": "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat;",
  "32": "but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not; and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren.",
  "33": "And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.",
  "34": "And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.",
  "35": "And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.",
  "36": "He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword;",
  "37": "for I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with [the] lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.",
  "38": "And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.",
  "39": "And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.",
  "40": "And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.",
  "41": "And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and having knelt down he prayed,",
  "42": "saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: but then, not my will, but thine be done.",
  "43": "And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.",
  "44": "And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth.",
  "45": "And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.",
  "46": "And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation.",
  "47": "As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.",
  "48": "And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?",
  "49": "And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?",
  "50": "And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear.",
  "51": "And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him.",
  "52": "And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks?",
  "53": "When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.",
  "54": "And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.",
  "55": "And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together, Peter sat among them.",
  "56": "And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light, and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was with him.",
  "57": "But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him.",
  "58": "And after a short time another seeing him said, And *thou* art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.",
  "59": "And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him, for also he is a Galilaean.",
  "60": "And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew.",
  "61": "And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.",
  "62": "And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly.",
  "63": "And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him];",
  "64": "and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?",
  "65": "And they said many other injurious things to him.",
  "66": "And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and led him into their council, saying,",
  "67": "If *thou* art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not at all believe;",
  "68": "and if I should ask [you], ye would not answer me at all, nor let me go;",
  "69": "but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.",
  "70": "And they all said, *Thou* then art the Son of God? And he said to them, *Ye* say that I am.",
  "71": "And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth?"
