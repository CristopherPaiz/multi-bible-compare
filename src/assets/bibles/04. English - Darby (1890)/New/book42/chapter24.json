  "1": "But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared.",
  "2": "And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.",
  "3": "And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.",
  "4": "And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment.",
  "5": "And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?",
  "6": "He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee,",
  "7": "saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.",
  "8": "And they remembered his words;",
  "9": "and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.",
  "10": "Now it was Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the [mother] of James, and the others with them, who told these things to the apostles.",
  "11": "And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them.",
  "12": "But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened.",
  "13": "And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus;",
  "14": "and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place.",
  "15": "And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them;",
  "16": "but their eyes were holden so as not to know him.",
  "17": "And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast?",
  "18": "And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him, Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days?",
  "19": "And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;",
  "20": "and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.",
  "21": "But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place.",
  "22": "And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre,",
  "23": "and, not having found his body, came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.",
  "24": "And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.",
  "25": "And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!",
  "26": "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?",
  "27": "And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.",
  "28": "And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther.",
  "29": "And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them.",
  "30": "And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them.",
  "31": "And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them.",
  "32": "And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the scriptures to us?",
  "33": "And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together,",
  "34": "saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.",
  "35": "And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.",
  "36": "And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.",
  "37": "But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.",
  "38": "And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?",
  "39": "behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.",
  "40": "And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.",
  "41": "But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?",
  "42": "And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;",
  "43": "and he took it and ate before them.",
  "44": "And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.",
  "45": "Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,",
  "46": "and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;",
  "47": "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.",
  "48": "And *ye* are witnesses of these things.",
  "49": "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high.",
  "50": "And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.",
  "51": "And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.",
  "52": "And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,",
  "53": "and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God."
