  "4": "And he would not for a time; but afterwards he said within himself, If even I fear not God and respect not man,",
  "5": "at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her, that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me.",
  "6": "And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.",
  "7": "And shall not God at all avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, and he bears long as to them?",
  "8": "I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily. But when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?",
  "9": "And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable:",

  "11": "The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.",
  "12": "I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.",
  "13": "And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.",
  "14": "I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.",

  "17": "Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.",
  "18": "And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?",

  "20": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.",
  "21": "And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.",
  "22": "And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me.",
  "23": "But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.",
  "24": "But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;",
  "25": "for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",

  "27": "But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.",
  "28": "And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee.",
  "29": "And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,",

  "32": "for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.",
