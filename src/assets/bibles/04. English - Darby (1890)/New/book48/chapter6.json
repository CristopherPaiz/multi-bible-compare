  "1": "Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted.",
  "2": "Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ.",
  "3": "For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself;",
  "4": "but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another.",
  "5": "For each shall bear his own burden.",
  "6": "Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.",
  "7": "Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap.",
  "8": "For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life:",
  "9": "but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap.",
  "10": "So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith.",
  "11": "See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.",
  "12": "As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.",
  "13": "For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.",
  "14": "But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me, and I to the world.",
  "15": "For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation.",
  "16": "And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",
  "17": "For the rest let no one trouble me, for *I* bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.",
  "18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit, brethren. Amen."
