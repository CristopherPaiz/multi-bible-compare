  "1": "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage.",
  "2": "Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",
  "3": "And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.",
  "4": "Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace.",
  "5": "For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness.",
  "6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.",
  "7": "Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth?",
  "8": "The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.",
  "9": "A little leaven leavens the whole lump.",
  "10": "*I* have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.",
  "11": "But *I*, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away.",
  "12": "I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.",
  "13": "For *ye* have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another.",
  "14": "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;",
  "15": "but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another.",
  "16": "But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust.",
  "17": "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;",
  "18": "but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.",
  "19": "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,",
  "20": "idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,",
  "21": "envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God's kingdom.",
  "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,",
  "23": "meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law.",
  "24": "But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.",
  "25": "If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.",
  "26": "Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another."
