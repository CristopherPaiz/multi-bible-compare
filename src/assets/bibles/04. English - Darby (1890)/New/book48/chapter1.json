  "1": "Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among [the] dead,",

  "7": "which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.",
  "8": "But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.",
  "9": "As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed.",
  "10": "For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman.",

  "15": "But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,",
  "16": "was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood,",
  "17": "nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.",
  "18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;",
  "19": "but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord.",
  "20": "Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.",
  "21": "Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
  "22": "But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ;",
  "23": "only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged:",
  "24": "and they glorified God in me."
