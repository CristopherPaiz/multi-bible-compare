  "1": "Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying,",
  "2": "Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.",
  "3": "But he answering said to them, Why do *ye* also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching?",
  "4": "For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death.",
  "5": "But *ye* say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited:",
  "6": "and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching.",
  "7": "Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying,",
  "8": "This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me;",
  "9": "but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men.",
  "10": "And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand:",
  "11": "Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.",
  "12": "Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?",
  "13": "But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.",
  "14": "Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch.",
  "15": "And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable.",
  "16": "But he said, Are *ye* also still without intelligence?",
  "17": "Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught?",
  "18": "but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man.",
  "19": "For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies;",
  "20": "these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man.",
  "21": "And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon;",
  "22": "and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.",
  "23": "But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.",
  "24": "But he answering said, I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel's house.",
  "25": "But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.",
  "26": "But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.",
  "27": "But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.",
  "28": "Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from *that* hour.",
  "29": "And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;",
  "30": "and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:",
  "31": "so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.",
  "32": "But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.",
  "33": "And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?",
  "34": "And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.",
  "35": "And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;",
  "36": "and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.",
  "37": "And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full;",
  "38": "but they that ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.",
  "39": "And, having dismissed the crowds, he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan."
