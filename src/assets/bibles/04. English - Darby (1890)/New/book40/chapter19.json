  "6": "so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.",
  "7": "They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away?",
  "8": "He says to them, Moses, in view of your hardheartedness, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not thus.",
  "9": "But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery.",

  "17": "And he said to him, What askest thou me concerning goodness? one is good. But if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.",
  "18": "He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,",
  "19": "Honour thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
