  "9": "go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways, and as many as ye shall find invite to the wedding feast.",
  "10": "And those bondmen went out into the highways, and brought together all as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests.",
  "11": "And the king, having gone in to see the guests, beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment.",
  "12": "And he says to him, [My] friend, how camest thou in here not having on a wedding garment? But he was speechless.",

  "20": "And he says to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?",
  "21": "They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God.",
  "22": "And when they heard [him], they wondered, and left him, and went away.",
  "23": "On that day came to him Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him,",
  "24": "saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife and shall raise up seed to his brother.",
  "25": "Now there were with us seven brethren; and the first having married died, and not having seed, left his wife to his brother.",
  "26": "In like manner also the second and the third, unto the seven.",
  "27": "And last of all the woman also died.",
  "28": "In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife, for all had her?",
  "29": "And Jesus answering said to them, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.",
  "30": "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven.",
  "31": "But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,",
  "32": "*I* am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not God of [the] dead, but of [the] living.",
  "33": "And when the crowds heard [it] they were astonished at his doctrine.",
  "34": "But the Pharisees, having heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, were gathered together.",

  "36": "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?",
  "37": "And he said to him, Thou shalt love [the] Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding.",
  "38": "This is [the] great and first commandment.",

  "40": "On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang.",
  "41": "And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus demanded of them,",
  "42": "saying, What think ye concerning the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, David's.",
  "43": "He says to them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,",
  "44": "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies under thy feet?",
  "45": "If therefore David call him Lord, how is he his son?",
  "46": "And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to question him any more."
