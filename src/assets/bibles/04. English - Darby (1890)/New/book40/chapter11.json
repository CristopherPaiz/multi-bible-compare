  "7": "But as they went [away], Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed moved about by the wind?",
  "8": "But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in delicate raiment? behold, those who wear delicate things are in the houses of kings.",
  "9": "But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet:",
  "10": "this is he of whom it is written, Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.",
  "11": "Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among [the] born of women a greater than John the baptist. But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.",

  "21": "Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if the works of power which have taken place in you, had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes.",
  "22": "But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you.",
  "23": "And *thou*, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven, shalt be brought down even to hades. For if the works of power which have taken place in thee, had taken place in Sodom, it had remained until this day.",
