  "1": "For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard.",
  "2": "And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard.",
  "3": "And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle;",
  "4": "and to them he said, Go also ye into the vineyard, and whatsoever may be just I will give you. And they went their way.",
  "5": "Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.",
  "6": "But about the eleventh [hour], having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?",
  "7": "They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard [and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive].",
  "8": "But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.",
  "9": "And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.",
  "10": "And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius.",
  "11": "And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,",
  "12": "saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.",
  "13": "But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius?",
  "14": "Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee:",
  "15": "is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because *I* am good?",
  "16": "Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones.",
  "17": "And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them,",
  "18": "Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;",
  "19": "and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and the third day he shall rise again.",
  "20": "Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, doing homage, and asking something of him.",
  "21": "And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Speak [the word] that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom.",
  "22": "And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which *I* am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.",
  "23": "[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.",
  "24": "And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers.",
  "25": "But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them.",
  "26": "It shall not be thus amongst you, but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your servant;",
  "27": "and whosoever will be first among you, let him be your bondman;",
  "28": "as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.",
  "29": "And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him.",
  "30": "And lo, two blind men, sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.",
  "31": "But the crowd rebuked them, that they might be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.",
  "32": "And Jesus, having stopped, called them and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?",
  "33": "They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.",
  "34": "And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them, and they followed him."
