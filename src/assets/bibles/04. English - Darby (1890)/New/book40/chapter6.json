  "1": "Take heed not to do your alms before men to be seen of them, otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.",
  "2": "When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "3": "But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does;",
  "4": "so that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee.",
  "5": "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "6": "But *thou*, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee.",
  "7": "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as those who are of the nations: for they think they shall be heard through their much speaking.",
  "8": "Be not ye therefore like them, for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye beg [anything] of him.",
  "9": "Thus therefore pray *ye*: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified,",
  "10": "let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth;",
  "11": "give us to-day our needed bread,",
  "12": "and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors,",
  "13": "and lead us not into temptation, but save us from evil.",
  "14": "For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father also will forgive you [yours],",
  "15": "but if ye do not forgive men their offences, neither will your Father forgive your offences.",
  "16": "And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, downcast in countenance; for they disfigure their faces, so that they may appear fasting to men: verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "17": "But *thou*, [when] fasting, anoint thy head and wash thy face,",
  "18": "so that thou mayest not appear fasting unto men, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret shall render [it] to thee.",
  "19": "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust spoils, and where thieves dig through and steal;",
  "20": "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust spoils, and where thieves do not dig through nor steal;",
  "21": "for where thy treasure is, there will be also thy heart.",
  "22": "The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light:",
  "23": "but if thine eye be wicked, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great the darkness!",
  "24": "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.",
  "25": "For this cause I say unto you, Do not be careful about your life, what ye should eat and what ye should drink; nor for your body what ye should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?",
  "26": "Look at the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into granaries, and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are *ye* not much more excellent than they?",
  "27": "But which of you by carefulness can add to his growth one cubit?",
  "28": "And why are ye careful about clothing? Observe with attention the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin;",
  "29": "but I say unto you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these.",
  "30": "But if God so clothe the herbage of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, will he not much rather you, O [ye] of little faith?",
  "31": "Be not therefore careful, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we put on?",
  "32": "for all these things the nations seek after; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.",
  "33": "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.",
  "34": "Be not careful therefore for the morrow, for the morrow shall be careful about itself. Sufficient to the day [is] its own evil."
