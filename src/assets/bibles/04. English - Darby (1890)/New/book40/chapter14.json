  "1": "At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,",
  "2": "and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: *he* is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him.",
  "3": "For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.",
  "4": "For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.",
  "5": "And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet.",
  "6": "But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;",
  "7": "whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.",
  "8": "But she, being set on by her mother, says, Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist.",
  "9": "And the king was grieved; but on account of the oaths, and those lying at table with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.",
  "10": "And he sent and beheaded John in the prison;",
  "11": "and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother.",
  "12": "And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus.",
  "13": "And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.",
  "14": "And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.",
  "15": "But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.",
  "16": "But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give *ye* them to eat.",
  "17": "But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.",
  "18": "And he said, Bring them here to me.",
  "19": "And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.",
  "20": "And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full.",
  "21": "But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",
  "22": "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds.",
  "23": "And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there,",
  "24": "but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.",
  "25": "But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.",
  "26": "And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.",
  "27": "But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is *I*: be not afraid.",
  "28": "And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters.",
  "29": "And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.",
  "30": "But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.",
  "31": "And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?",
  "32": "And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell.",
  "33": "But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son.",
  "34": "And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret.",
  "35": "And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill,",
  "36": "and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well."
