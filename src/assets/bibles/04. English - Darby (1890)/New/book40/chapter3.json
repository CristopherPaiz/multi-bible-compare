  "1": "Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,",
  "2": "and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.",
  "3": "For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.",
  "4": "And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.",
  "5": "Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan,",
  "6": "and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.",
  "7": "But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?",
  "8": "Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.",
  "9": "And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.",
  "10": "And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.",
  "11": "*I* indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; *he* shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit and fire;",
  "12": "whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.",
  "13": "Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him;",
  "14": "but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?",
  "15": "But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him.",
  "16": "And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:",
  "17": "and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight."
