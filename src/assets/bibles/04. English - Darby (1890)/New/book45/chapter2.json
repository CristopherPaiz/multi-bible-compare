  "1": "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.",
  "2": "But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things.",
  "3": "And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?",
  "4": "or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?",
  "5": "but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God,",
  "6": "who shall render to each according to his works:",
  "7": "to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal.",
  "8": "But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation,",
  "9": "tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;",
  "10": "but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:",
  "11": "for there is no acceptance of persons with God.",
  "12": "For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,",
  "13": "(for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.",
  "14": "For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;",
  "15": "who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)",
  "16": "in [the] day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ.",
  "17": "But if *thou* art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God,",
  "18": "and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;",
  "19": "and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who [are] in darkness,",
  "20": "an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law:",
  "21": "thou then that teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself? thou that preachest not to steal, dost thou steal?",
  "22": "thou that sayest [man should] not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?",
  "23": "thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?",
  "24": "For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is written.",
  "25": "For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.",
  "26": "If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision,",
  "27": "and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor?",
  "28": "For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;",
  "29": "but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God."
