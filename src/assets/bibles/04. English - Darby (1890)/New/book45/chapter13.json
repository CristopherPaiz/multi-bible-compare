  "1": "Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.",
  "2": "So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.",
  "3": "For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it;",
  "4": "for it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.",
  "5": "Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.",
  "6": "For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God's officers, attending continually on this very thing.",

  "9": "For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",

  "11": "This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.",
  "12": "The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.",
  "13": "As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.",
  "14": "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts."
