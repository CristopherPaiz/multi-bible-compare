  "2": "And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of [your] mind, that ye may prove what [is] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.",
  "3": "For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.",
  "4": "For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office;",
  "5": "thus we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other.",

  "16": "Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes:",
  "17": "recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men:",
  "18": "if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men;",
  "19": "not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, *I* will recompense, saith the Lord.",
  "20": "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.",
  "21": "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
