  "1": "But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to,",
  "2": "for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of [the] Lord so comes as a thief by night.",
  "3": "When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon her that is with child; and they shall in no wise escape.",
  "4": "But *ye*, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief:",
  "5": "for all *ye* are sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.",
  "6": "So then do not let us sleep as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober;",
  "7": "for they that sleep sleep by night, and they that drink drink by night;",
  "8": "but *we* being of [the] day, let us be sober, putting on [the] breastplate of faith and love, and as helmet [the] hope of salvation;",
  "9": "because God has not set us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "10": "who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him.",
  "11": "Wherefore encourage one another, and build up each one the other, even as also ye do.",
  "12": "But we beg you, brethren, to know those who labour among you, and take the lead among you in [the] Lord, and admonish you,",
  "13": "and to regard them exceedingly in love on account of their work. Be in peace among yourselves.",
  "14": "But we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, be patient towards all.",
  "15": "See that no one render to any evil for evil, but pursue always what is good towards one another and towards all;",
  "16": "rejoice always;",
  "17": "pray unceasingly;",
  "18": "in everything give thanks, for this is [the] will of God in Christ Jesus towards you;",
  "19": "quench not the Spirit;",
  "20": "do not lightly esteem prophecies;",
  "21": "but prove all things, hold fast the right;",
  "22": "hold aloof from every form of wickedness.",
  "23": "Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "24": "He [is] faithful who calls you, who will also perform [it].",
  "25": "Brethren, pray for us.",
  "26": "Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.",
  "27": "I adjure you by the Lord that the letter be read to all the [holy] brethren.",
  "28": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you."
