  "1": "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away.",
  "2": "For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,",
  "3": "how shall *we* escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;",
  "4": "God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will?",
  "5": "For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;",
  "6": "but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?",

  "14": "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;",

  "16": "For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.",
  "17": "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;",
  "18": "for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted."
