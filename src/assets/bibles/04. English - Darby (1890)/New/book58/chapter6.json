  "1": "Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,",
  "2": "of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment;",
  "3": "and this will we do if God permit.",
  "4": "For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,",
  "5": "and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come,",
  "6": "and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].",
  "7": "For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;",
  "8": "but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.",
  "9": "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.",
  "10": "For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering.",
  "11": "But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;",
  "12": "that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.",
  "13": "For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,",
  "14": "saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;",
  "15": "and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.",
  "16": "For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.",
  "17": "Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,",
  "18": "that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,",
  "19": "which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,",
  "20": "where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec."
