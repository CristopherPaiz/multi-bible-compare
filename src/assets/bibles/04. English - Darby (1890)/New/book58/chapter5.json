  "3": "and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.",
  "4": "And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.",
  "5": "Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee.",
  "6": "Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.",
  "7": "Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)",

  "9": "and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;",

  "13": "For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;",
  "14": "but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil."
