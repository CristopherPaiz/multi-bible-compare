  "1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,",
  "2": "who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house.",
  "3": "For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.",
  "4": "For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God.",
  "5": "And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;",
  "6": "but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.",
  "7": "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,",
  "8": "harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;",
  "9": "where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years.",
  "10": "Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways;",
  "11": "so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.",
  "12": "See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God.",
  "13": "But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.",
  "14": "For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;",
  "15": "in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation;",
  "16": "(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?",
  "17": "And with whom was he wroth forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?",
  "18": "And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word?",
  "19": "And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)"
