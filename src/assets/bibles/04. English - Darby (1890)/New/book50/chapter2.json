  "3": "[let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves;",
  "4": "regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of others also.",
  "5": "For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ Jesus;",
  "6": "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God;",
  "7": "but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in [the] likeness of men;",
  "8": "and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and [that the] death of [the] cross.",
  "9": "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name,",

  "17": "But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all.",
  "18": "In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.",

  "24": "but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come;",
  "25": "but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need,",
  "26": "since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;",

  "29": "Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour;",
  "30": "because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me."
