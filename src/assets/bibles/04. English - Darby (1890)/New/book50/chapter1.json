  "1": "Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the] overseers and ministers;",
  "2": "grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "3": "I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,",
  "4": "constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy,",
  "5": "because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now;",
  "6": "having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:",
  "7": "as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace.",
  "8": "For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the] bowels of Christ Jesus.",
  "9": "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence,",
  "10": "that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day,",
  "11": "being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which [is] by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.",
  "12": "But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings,",
  "13": "so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others;",
  "14": "and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly.",
  "15": "Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for good will, preach the Christ.",
  "16": "These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings;",
  "17": "but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds.",
  "18": "What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;",
  "19": "for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;",
  "20": "according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.",
  "21": "For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain;",
  "22": "but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.",
  "23": "But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better,",
  "24": "but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes;",
  "25": "and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith;",
  "26": "that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you.",
  "27": "Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings;",
  "28": "and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;",
  "29": "because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,",
  "30": "having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me."
