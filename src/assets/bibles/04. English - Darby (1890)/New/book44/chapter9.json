  "20": "And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God.",
  "21": "And all who heard were astonished and said, Is not this *he* who destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name, and here was come for this purpose, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?",

  "28": "And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem,",
  "29": "and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and discussed with the Hellenists; but they sought to kill him.",
  "30": "And the brethren knowing it, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.",
  "31": "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit.",
