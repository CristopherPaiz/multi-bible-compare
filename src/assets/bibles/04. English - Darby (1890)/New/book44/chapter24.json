  "1": "And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid their informations against Paul before the governor.",
  "2": "And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought,",
  "3": "we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.",
  "4": "But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness.",
  "5": "For finding this man a pest, and moving sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazaraeans;",
  "6": "who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also had seized, [and would have judged according to our law;",
  "7": "but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming up, took [him] away with great force out of our hands,",
  "8": "having commanded his accusers to come to thee;] of whom thou canst thyself, in examining [him], know the certainty of all these things of which we accuse him.",
  "9": "And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so.",
  "10": "But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself.",
  "11": "As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,",
  "12": "and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;",
  "13": "neither can they make good the things of which they now accuse me.",
  "14": "But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets;",
  "15": "having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is to be a resurrection both of just and unjust.",
  "16": "For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men.",
  "17": "And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms to my nation, and offerings.",
  "18": "Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia,",
  "19": "who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me;",
  "20": "or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council,",
  "21": "[other] than concerning this one voice which I cried standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching [the] resurrection of [the] dead.",
  "22": "And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair;",
  "23": "ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him.",
  "24": "And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.",
  "25": "And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee;",
  "26": "hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.",
  "27": "But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound."
