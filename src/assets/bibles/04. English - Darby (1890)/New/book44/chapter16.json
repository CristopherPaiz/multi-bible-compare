  "3": "Him would Paul have go forth with him, and took [him and] circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew his father that he was a Greek.",

  "10": "And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings.",
  "11": "Having sailed therefore away from Troas, we went in a straight course to Samothracia, and on the morrow to Neapolis,",
  "12": "and thence to Philippi, which is [the] first city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city certain days.",
  "13": "And on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where it was the custom for prayer to be, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had assembled.",

  "17": "She, having followed Paul and us, cried saying, These men are bondmen of the Most High God, who announce to you [the] way of salvation.",
  "18": "And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed, turned, and said to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.",
  "19": "And her masters, seeing that the hope of their gains was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the market before the magistrates;",
  "20": "and having brought them up to the praetors, said, These men utterly trouble our city, being Jews,",

  "24": "who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks.",
  "25": "And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them.",
  "26": "And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed.",
  "27": "And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled.",

  "36": "And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The praetors have sent that ye may be let go. Now therefore go out and depart in peace.",
  "37": "But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out.",
  "38": "And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And they were afraid when they heard they were Romans.",
  "39": "And they came and besought them, and having brought them out, asked them to go out of the city.",
