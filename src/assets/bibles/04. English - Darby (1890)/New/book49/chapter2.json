  "3": "among whom *we* also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do, and were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest:",

  "15": "having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace;",
  "16": "and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, having by it slain the enmity;",
  "17": "and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who [were] afar off, and [the glad tidings of] peace to those [who were] nigh.",
  "18": "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father.",
  "19": "So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,",

  "21": "in whom all [the] building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord;",
  "22": "in whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of God in [the] Spirit."
