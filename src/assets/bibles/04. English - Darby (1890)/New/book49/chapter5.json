  "1": "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children,",
  "2": "and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.",
  "3": "But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints;",
  "4": "and filthiness and foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient; but rather thanksgiving.",
  "5": "For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.",
  "7": "Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them;",
  "8": "for ye were once darkness, but now light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light,",
  "9": "(for the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)",
  "10": "proving what is agreeable to the Lord;",
  "11": "and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove [them],",
  "12": "for the things that are done by them in secret it is shameful even to say.",
  "13": "But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light.",
  "14": "Wherefore he says, Wake up, [thou] that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.",
  "15": "See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise,",
  "16": "redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
  "17": "For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what [is] the will of the Lord.",
  "18": "And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,",
  "19": "speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord;",
  "20": "giving thanks at all times for all things to him [who is] God and [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "21": "submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord,",
  "23": "for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly. *He* [is] Saviour of the body.",
  "24": "But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it,",
  "26": "in order that he might sanctify it, purifying [it] by the washing of water by [the] word,",
  "27": "that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless.",
  "28": "So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.",
  "29": "For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:",
  "30": "for we are members of his body; [we are of his flesh, and of his bones.]",
  "31": "Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.",
  "32": "This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.",
  "33": "But *ye* also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself; but as to the wife [I speak] that she may fear the husband."
