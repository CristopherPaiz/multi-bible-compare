  "1": "Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him].",
  "2": "And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him,",
  "3": "and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.",
  "4": "And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever.",
  "5": "(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man!",
  "6": "When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him.",
  "7": "The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.",
  "8": "When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid,",
  "9": "and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
  "10": "Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?",
  "11": "Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.",
  "12": "From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.",
  "13": "Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;",
  "14": "(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king!",
  "15": "But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.",
  "16": "Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.",
  "17": "And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;",
  "18": "where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.",
  "19": "And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.",
  "20": "This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.",
  "21": "The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews.",
  "22": "Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.",
  "23": "The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top.",
  "24": "They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.",
  "25": "And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.",
  "26": "Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.",
  "27": "Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.",
  "28": "After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.",
  "29": "There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth.",
  "30": "When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit.",
  "31": "The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away.",
  "32": "The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him;",
  "33": "but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,",
  "34": "but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.",
  "35": "And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.",
  "36": "For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.",
  "37": "And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.",
  "38": "And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.",
  "39": "And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].",
  "40": "They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial.",
  "41": "But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.",
  "42": "There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus."
