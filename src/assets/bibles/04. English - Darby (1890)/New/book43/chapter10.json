  "1": "Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, *he* is a thief and a robber;",
  "2": "but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep.",
  "3": "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.",
  "4": "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.",
  "5": "But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.",
  "6": "This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was [of] which he spoke to them.",
  "7": "Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.",
  "8": "All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.",
  "9": "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture.",
  "10": "The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly.",
  "11": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep:",
  "12": "but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep.",
  "13": "Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep.",
  "14": "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine,",
  "15": "as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
  "16": "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.",
  "17": "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.",
  "18": "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father.",
  "19": "There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words;",
  "20": "but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him?",
  "21": "Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people's eyes?",
  "22": "Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter.",
  "23": "And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.",
  "24": "The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say [so] to us openly.",
  "25": "Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness concerning me:",
  "26": "but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.",
  "27": "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;",
  "28": "and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.",
  "29": "My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.",
  "30": "I and the Father are one.",
  "31": "The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him.",
  "32": "Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?",
  "33": "The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.",
  "34": "Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?",
  "35": "If he called *them* gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),",
  "36": "do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?",
  "37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;",
  "38": "but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him.",
  "39": "They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand",
  "40": "and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.",
  "41": "And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true.",
  "42": "And many believed on him there."
