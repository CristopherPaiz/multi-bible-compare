  "1": "And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.",
  "2": "And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this [man] or his parents, that he should be born blind?",
  "3": "Jesus answered, Neither has this [man] sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him.",
  "4": "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day. [The] night is coming, when no one can work.",
  "5": "As long as I am in the world, I am [the] light of the world.",
  "6": "Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes.",
  "7": "And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing.",
  "8": "The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging?",
  "9": "Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: *he* said, It is I.",
  "10": "They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened?",
  "11": "He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw.",
  "12": "They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know.",
  "13": "They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees.",
  "14": "Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.",
  "15": "The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
  "16": "Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them.",
  "17": "They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.",
  "18": "The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight.",
  "19": "And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see?",
  "20": "His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;",
  "21": "but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; *he* will speak concerning himself.",
  "22": "His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue.",
  "23": "On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*.",
  "24": "They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.",
  "25": "He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.",
  "26": "And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
  "27": "He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?",
  "28": "They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.",
  "29": "We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is.",
  "30": "The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes.",
  "31": "[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.",
  "32": "Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.",
  "33": "If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing.",
  "34": "They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.",
  "35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?",
  "36": "He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?",
  "37": "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.",
  "38": "And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.",
  "39": "And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind.",
  "40": "And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?",
  "41": "Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains."
