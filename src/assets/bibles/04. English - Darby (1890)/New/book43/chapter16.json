  "1": "These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended.",
  "2": "They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God;",
  "3": "and these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me.",
  "4": "But I have spoken these things to you, that when their hour shall have come, ye may remember them, that I have said [them] unto you. But I did not say these things unto you from [the] beginning, because I was with you.",
  "5": "But now I go to him that has sent me, and none of you demands of me, Where goest thou?",
  "6": "But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.",
  "7": "But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you.",
  "8": "And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:",
  "9": "of sin, because they do not believe on me;",
  "10": "of righteousness, because I go away to [my] Father, and ye behold me no longer;",
  "11": "of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.",
  "12": "I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.",
  "13": "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming.",
  "14": "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce [it] to you.",
  "15": "All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce [it] to you.",
  "16": "A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, [because I go away to the Father].",
  "17": "[Some] of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this he says to us, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, and, Because I go away to the Father?",
  "18": "They said therefore, What is this which he says [of] the little while? We do not know [of] what he speaks.",
  "19": "Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him, and said to them, Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I said, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me?",
  "20": "Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy.",
  "21": "A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief because her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world.",
  "22": "And ye now therefore have grief; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.",
  "23": "And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me: verily, verily, I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.",
  "24": "Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.",
  "25": "These things I have spoken to you in allegories; the hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but will declare to you openly concerning the Father.",
  "26": "In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you,",
  "27": "for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God.",
  "28": "I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.",
  "29": "His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory.",
  "30": "Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast not need that any one should demand of thee. By this we believe that thou art come from God.",
  "31": "Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?",
  "32": "Behold, [the] hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone; and [yet] I am not alone, for the Father is with me.",
  "33": "These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good courage: I have overcome the world."
