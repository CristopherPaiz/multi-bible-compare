  "12": "Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.",

  "16": "He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.",
  "17": "He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.",
  "18": "Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire.",

  "22": "Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.",
  "23": "This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee?",
  "24": "This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true.",
  "25": "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written."
