  "1": "Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord.",
  "2": "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in [the] body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such [a one] caught up to [the] third heaven.",
  "3": "And I know such a man, (whether in [the] body or out of the body I know not, God knows;)",
  "4": "that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter.",
  "5": "Of such [a one] I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses.",
  "6": "For if I shall desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say [the] truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me [to be], or whatever he may hear of me.",
  "7": "And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted.",
  "8": "For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me.",
  "9": "And he said to me, My grace suffices thee; for [my] power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me.",
  "10": "Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful.",
  "11": "I have become a fool; *ye* have compelled me; for *I* ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing.",
  "12": "The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power.",
  "13": "For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury.",
  "14": "Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",
  "15": "Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved.",
  "16": "But be it so. *I* did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile.",
  "17": "Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you?",
  "18": "I begged Titus, and sent the brother with [him]: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? [have we] not in the same steps?",
  "19": "Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up.",
  "20": "For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest [there might be] strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;",
  "21": "lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised."
