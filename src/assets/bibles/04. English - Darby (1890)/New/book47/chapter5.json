  "1": "For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
  "2": "For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which [is] from heaven;",
  "3": "if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked.",
  "4": "For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that [what is] mortal may be swallowed up by life.",
  "5": "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing [is] God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.",
  "6": "Therefore [we are] always confident, and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord,",
  "7": "(for we walk by faith, not by sight;)",
  "8": "we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord.",
  "9": "Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him.",
  "10": "For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to those he has done, whether [it be] good or evil.",
  "11": "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences.",
  "12": "[For] we do not again commend ourselves to you, but [we are] giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf, that ye may have [such] with those boasting in countenance, and not in heart.",
  "13": "For whether we are beside ourselves, [it is] to God; or are sober, [it is] for you.",
  "14": "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died;",
  "15": "and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.",
  "16": "So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know [him thus] no longer.",
  "17": "So if any one [be] in Christ, [there is] a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new:",
  "18": "and all things [are] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [Jesus] Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation:",
  "19": "how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences; and putting in us the word of that reconciliation.",
  "20": "We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as [it were] beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, Be reconciled to God.",
  "21": "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that *we* might become God's righteousness in him."
