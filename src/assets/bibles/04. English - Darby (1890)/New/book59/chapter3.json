  "1": "Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment.",
  "2": "For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, *he* [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.",
  "3": "Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.",
  "4": "Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.",
  "5": "Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!",
  "6": "and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.",
  "7": "For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species;",
  "8": "but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.",
  "9": "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness of God.",
  "10": "Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.",
  "11": "Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter?",
  "12": "Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water.",
  "13": "Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;",
  "14": "but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.",
  "15": "This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish.",
  "16": "For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing.",
  "17": "But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned.",
  "18": "But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace."
