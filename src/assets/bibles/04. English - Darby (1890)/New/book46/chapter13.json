  "1": "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.",
  "2": "And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing.",
  "4": "Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up,",
  "5": "does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil,",
  "6": "does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth,",
  "7": "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.",

  "11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child.",

  "13": "And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these [is] love."
