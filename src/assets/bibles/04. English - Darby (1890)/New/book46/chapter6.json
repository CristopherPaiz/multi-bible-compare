  "1": "Dare any one of you, having a matter against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the saints?",
  "2": "Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the] smallest judgments?",
  "3": "Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then matters of this life?",
  "4": "If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly.",
  "5": "I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!",
  "6": "But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers.",
  "7": "Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?",
  "8": "But *ye* do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.",
  "9": "Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,",
  "10": "nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.",
  "11": "And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.",
  "12": "All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but *I* will not be brought under the power of any.",
  "13": "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
  "14": "And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power.",
  "15": "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.",
  "16": "Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.",
  "17": "But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.",
  "18": "Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.",
  "19": "Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?",
  "20": "for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body."
