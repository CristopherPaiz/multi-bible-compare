  "6": "But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted.",
  "7": "Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.",
  "8": "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.",
  "9": "Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.",
  "10": "Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.",
  "11": "Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.",

  "13": "No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to bear [it].",
  "14": "Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",
  "15": "I speak as to intelligent [persons]: do *ye* judge what I say.",
  "16": "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not [the] communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not [the] communion of the body of the Christ?",
  "17": "Because we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf.",
  "18": "See Israel according to flesh: are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar?",
  "19": "What then do I say? that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
  "20": "But that what [the nations] sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in communion with demons.",
  "21": "Ye cannot drink [the] Lord's cup, and [the] cup of demons: ye cannot partake of [the] Lord's table, and of [the] table of demons.",
  "22": "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?",
  "23": "All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify.",
