  "1": "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.",
  "2": "Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",
  "3": "But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself.",
  "4": "For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.",
  "5": "So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.",
  "6": "Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another.",
  "7": "For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?",
  "8": "Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you.",
  "9": "For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.",
  "10": "*We* [are] fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour.",
  "11": "To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,",
  "12": "and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];",
  "13": "insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.",
  "14": "Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].",
  "15": "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings.",
  "16": "I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.",
  "17": "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.",
  "18": "But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you;",
  "19": "but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power.",
  "20": "For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.",
  "21": "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness?"
