  "1": "Be my imitators, even as *I* also [am] of Christ.",
  "2": "Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions.",
  "3": "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head [is] the man, and the Christ's head God.",
  "4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having [anything] on his head, puts his head to shame.",
  "5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved [woman].",
  "6": "For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.",
  "7": "For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God's image and glory; but woman is man's glory.",
  "8": "For man is not of woman, but woman of man.",
  "9": "For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.",
  "10": "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.",
  "11": "However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without woman, in [the] Lord.",
  "12": "For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by the woman, but all things of God.",
  "13": "Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?",
  "14": "Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?",
  "15": "But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her; for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil.",
  "16": "But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God.",
  "17": "But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.",
  "18": "For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it].",
  "19": "For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you.",
  "20": "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat [the] Lord's supper.",
  "21": "For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess.",
  "22": "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise.",
  "23": "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,",
  "24": "and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me.",
  "25": "In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me.",
  "26": "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come.",
  "27": "So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord.",
  "28": "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.",
  "29": "For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body.",
  "30": "On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep.",
  "31": "But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.",
  "32": "But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.",
  "33": "So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.",
  "34": "If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order."
