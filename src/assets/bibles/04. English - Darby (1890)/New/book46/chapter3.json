  "1": "And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.",
  "2": "I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;",
  "3": "for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?",
  "4": "For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men?",
  "5": "Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.",
  "6": "*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.",
  "7": "So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.",
  "8": "But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.",
  "9": "For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building.",
  "10": "According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.",
  "11": "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,",
  "13": "the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.",
  "14": "If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.",
  "15": "If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.",
  "16": "Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
  "17": "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*.",
  "18": "Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.",
  "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.",
  "20": "And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.",
  "21": "So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.",
  "22": "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;",
  "23": "and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's."
