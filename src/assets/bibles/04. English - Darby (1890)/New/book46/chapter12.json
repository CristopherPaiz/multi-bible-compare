  "1": "But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.",
  "2": "Ye know that when ye were [of the] nations [ye were] led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.",
  "3": "I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit.",
  "4": "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;",
  "5": "and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord;",
  "6": "and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all.",
  "7": "But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit.",
  "8": "For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;",
  "9": "and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit;",
  "10": "and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues.",
  "11": "But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases.",
  "12": "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ.",
  "13": "For also in [the power of] one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.",
  "14": "For also the body is not one member but many.",
  "15": "If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?",
  "16": "And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?",
  "17": "If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling?",
  "18": "But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased [him].",
  "19": "But if all were one member, where the body?",
  "20": "But now the members [are] many, and the body one.",
  "21": "The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you.",
  "22": "But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;",
  "23": "and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;",
  "24": "but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked;",
  "25": "that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another.",
  "26": "And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].",
  "27": "Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular.",
  "28": "And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.",
  "29": "[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers?",
  "30": "have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?",
  "31": "But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence."
