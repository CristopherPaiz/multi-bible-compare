  "1": "My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous;",
  "2": "and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world.",
  "3": "And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.",
  "4": "He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;",
  "5": "but whoever keeps his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him.",
  "6": "He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk.",
  "7": "Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard.",
  "8": "Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.",
  "9": "He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.",
  "10": "He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.",
  "11": "But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.",
  "12": "I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.",
  "13": "I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.",
  "14": "I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one].",
  "15": "Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;",
  "16": "because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.",
  "17": "And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity.",
  "18": "Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour.",
  "19": "They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.",
  "20": "And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things.",
  "21": "I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.",
  "22": "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.",
  "23": "Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.",
  "24": "As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.",
  "25": "And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal.",
  "26": "These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:",
  "27": "and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him.",
  "28": "And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.",
  "29": "If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him."
