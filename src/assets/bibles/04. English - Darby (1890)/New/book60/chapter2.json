  "1": "Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,",
  "2": "as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation,",
  "3": "if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good.",
  "4": "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,",
  "5": "yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.",
  "6": "Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame.",
  "7": "To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of [the] corner,",
  "8": "and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been appointed.",
  "9": "But *ye* [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light;",
  "10": "who once [were] not a people, but now God's people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy.",
  "11": "Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;",
  "12": "having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them], glorify God in [the] day of visitation.",

  "14": "or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well.",
  "15": "Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men;",

  "17": "Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king.",
  "18": "Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered.",
  "19": "For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly.",
  "20": "For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall bear [it], this is acceptable with God.",
  "21": "For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps:",
  "22": "who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;",
  "23": "who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering, threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him who judges righteously;",
  "24": "who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye have been healed.",
  "25": "For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
