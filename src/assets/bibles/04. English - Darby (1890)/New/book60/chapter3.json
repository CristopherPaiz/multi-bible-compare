  "1": "Likewise, wives, [be] subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without [the] word by the conversation of the wives,",
  "2": "having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in fear;",
  "3": "whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;",
  "4": "but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.",
  "5": "For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands;",
  "6": "as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation.",
  "7": "[Ye] husbands likewise, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, as with a weaker, [even] the female, vessel, giving [them] honour, as also fellow-heirs of [the] grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.",
  "8": "Finally, [be] all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;",
  "9": "not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing [others], because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing.",
  "10": "For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile.",
  "11": "And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it;",
  "12": "because [the] eyes of [the] Lord [are] on [the] righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but [the] face of [the] Lord [is] against them that do evil.",
  "13": "And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which [is] good?",
  "14": "But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;",
  "15": "but sanctify [the] Lord the Christ in your hearts, and [be] always prepared to [give] an answer [to] every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that [is] in you, but with meekness and fear;",
  "16": "having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ.",
  "17": "For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer [as] well-doers than [as] evildoers;",
  "18": "for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit,",
  "19": "in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison,",
  "20": "heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:",
  "21": "which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a putting away of [the] filth of flesh, but [the] demand as before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ,",
  "22": "who is at [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him."
