  "16": "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.",

  "22": "Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord.",
  "23": "Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as [doing it] to the Lord, and not to men;",
  "24": "knowing that of [the] Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ.",
  "25": "For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done, and there is no respect of persons."
