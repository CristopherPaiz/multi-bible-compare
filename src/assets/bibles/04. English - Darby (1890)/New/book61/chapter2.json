  "1": "But there were false prophets also among the people, as there shall be also among you false teachers, who shall bring in by the bye destructive heresies, and deny the master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction;",
  "2": "and many shall follow their dissolute ways, through whom the way of the truth shall be blasphemed.",
  "3": "And through covetousness, with well-turned words, will they make merchandise of you: for whom judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction slumbers not.",
  "4": "For if God spared not [the] angels who had sinned, but having cast them down to the deepest pit of gloom has delivered them to chains of darkness [to be] kept for judgment;",
  "5": "and spared not [the] old world, but preserved Noe, [the] eighth, a preacher of righteousness, having brought in [the] flood upon [the] world of [the] ungodly;",
  "6": "and having reduced [the] cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to ashes, condemned [them] with an overthrow, setting [them as] an example to those that should [afterwards] live an ungodly life;",
  "7": "and saved righteous Lot, distressed with the abandoned conversation of the godless,",
  "8": "(for the righteous man through seeing and hearing, dwelling among them, tormented [his] righteous soul day after day with [their] lawless works,)",
  "9": "[the] Lord knows [how] to deliver the godly out of trial, and to keep [the] unjust to [the] day of judgment [to be] punished;",
  "10": "and specially those who walk after the flesh in [the] lust of uncleanness, and despise lordship. Bold [are they], self-willed; they do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities:",
  "11": "when angels, who are greater in might and power, do not bring against them, before the Lord, an injurious charge.",
  "12": "But these, as natural animals without reason, made to be caught and destroyed, speaking injuriously in things they are ignorant of, shall also perish in their own corruption,",
  "13": "receiving [the] reward of unrighteousness; accounting ephemeral indulgence pleasure; spots and blemishes, rioting in their own deceits, feasting with you;",
  "14": "having eyes full of adultery, and that cease not from sin, alluring unestablished souls; having a heart practised in covetousness, children of curse;",
  "15": "having left [the] straight way they have gone astray, having followed in the path of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved [the] reward of unrighteousness;",
  "16": "but had reproof of his own wickedness [the] dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the folly of the prophet.",
  "17": "These are springs without water, and mists driven by storm, to whom the gloom of darkness is reserved [for ever].",
  "18": "For [while] speaking great highflown words of vanity, they allure with [the] lusts of [the] flesh, by dissoluteness, those who have just fled those who walk in error,",
  "19": "promising them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a man is subdued, by him is he also brought into slavery.",
  "20": "For if after having escaped the pollutions of the world through [the] knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, again entangled, they are subdued by these, their last state is worse than the first.",
  "21": "For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known [it] to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.",
  "22": "But that [word] of the true proverb has happened to them: [The] dog [has] turned back to his own vomit; and, [The] washed sow to [her] rolling in mud."
