  "5": "But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].",
  "6": "But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,",
  "7": "Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?",
  "8": "And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?",

  "10": "But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,",

  "17": "And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.",
  "18": "And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?",

  "26": "how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?",
