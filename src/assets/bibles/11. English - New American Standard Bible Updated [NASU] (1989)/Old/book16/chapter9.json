  "16": "\"But they, our fathers, proved to be insolent; they held their necks stiff and would not obey your commandments.",
  "17": "They refused to obey and no longer remembered the miracles you had worked for them. They stiffened their necks and turned their heads to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God of pardons, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in mercy; you did not forsake them.",

  "27": "Therefore you delivered them into the power of their enemies, who oppressed them. But in the time of their oppression they would cry out to you, and you would hear them from heaven, and according to your great mercy give them saviors to deliver them from the power of their enemies.",
  "28": "\"As soon as they had relief, they would go back to doing evil in your sight. Then again you abandoned them to the power of their enemies, who crushed them. Then they cried out to you, and you heard them from heaven and delivered them according to your mercy, many times over.",
  "29": "You bore witness against them, in order to bring them back to your law.

They turned stubborn backs, stiffened their necks, and would not obey.",
  "30": "You were patient with them for many years, bearing witness against them through your spirit, by means of your prophets; still they would not listen. Thus you delivered them over into the power of the peoples of the lands.",

  "33": "In all that has come upon us you have been just, for you kept faith while we have done evil.",
  "34": "Yes, our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law; they paid no attention to your commandments and the obligations of which you reminded them.",
  "35": "While they were yet in their kingdom, in the midst of the many good things that you had given them and in the wide and fertile land that you had spread out before them, they did not serve you nor did they turn away from their evil deeds.",
  "36": "But, see, we today are slaves; and as for the land which you gave our fathers that they might eat its fruits and good things-- see, we have become slaves upon it!",
  "37": "Its rich produce goes to the kings whom you set over us because of our sins, who rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress!\""
