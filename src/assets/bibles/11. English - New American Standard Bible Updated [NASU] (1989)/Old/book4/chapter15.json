  "4": "whoever does so shall also present to the LORD a cereal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil,",

  "8": "When you sacrifice an ox as a holocaust, or in fulfillment of a vow, or as a peace offering to the LORD,",
  "9": "with it you shall present a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil,",

  "13": "\"All the native-born shall make these offerings in the same way, whenever they present a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.",
  "14": "Likewise, in any future generation, any alien residing with you permanently or for a time, who presents a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD, shall do as you do.",
  "15": "There is but one rule for you and for the resident alien, a perpetual rule for all your descendants. Before the LORD you and the alien are alike,",
  "16": "with the same law and the same application of it for the alien residing among you as for yourselves.\"",
  "17": "The LORD said to Moses,",

  "24": "if the community itself unwittingly becomes guilty of the fault of inadvertence, the whole community shall offer the holocaust of one young bull as a sweet-smelling oblation pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed cereal offering and libation, as well as one he-goat as a sin offering.",
  "25": "Then the priest shall make atonement for the whole Israelite community; thus they will be forgiven the inadvertence for which they have brought their holocaust as an oblation to the LORD.",
  "26": "Not only the whole Israelite community, but also the aliens residing among you, shall be forgiven, since the fault of inadvertence affects all the people.",
  "27": "\"However, if it is an individual who sins inadvertently, he shall bring a yearling she-goat as a sin offering,",
  "28": "and the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for him who sinned inadvertently; when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven.",
  "29": "You shall have but one law for him who sins inadvertently, whether he be a native Israelite or an alien residing with you.",
  "30": "\"But anyone who sins defiantly, whether he be a native or an alien, insults the LORD, and shall be cut off from among his people.",
  "31": "Since he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken his commandment, he must be cut off. He has only himself to blame.\"",

  "39": "When you use these tassels, let the sight of them remind you to keep all the commandments of the LORD, without going wantonly astray after the desires of your hearts and eyes.",
  "40": "Thus you will remember to keep all my commandments and be holy to your God.",
  "41": "I, the LORD, am your God who, as God, brought you out of Egypt that I, the LORD, may be your God.\""
