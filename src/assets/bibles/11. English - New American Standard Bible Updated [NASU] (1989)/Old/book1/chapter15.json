  "1": "Some time after these events, this word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: \"Fear not, Abram! I am your shield; I will make your reward very great.\"",
  "2": "But Abram said, \"O Lord GOD, what good will your gifts be, if I keep on being childless and have as my heir the steward of my house, Eliezer?\"",
  "3": "Abram continued, \"See, you have given me no offspring, and so one of my servants will be my heir.\"",
  "4": "Then the word of the LORD came to him: \"No, that one shall not be your heir; your own issue shall be your heir.\"",
  "5": "He took him outside and said: \"Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can. Just so,\" he added, \"shall your descendants be.\"",
  "6": "Abram put his faith in the LORD, who credited it to him as an act of righteousness.",
  "7": "He then said to him, \"I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as a possession.\"",
  "8": "\"O Lord GOD,\" he asked, \"How am I to know that I shall possess it?\"",

  "13": "Then the LORD said to Abram: \"Know for certain that your descendants shall be aliens in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.",
  "14": "But I will bring judgment on the nation they must serve, and in the end they will depart with great wealth.",
  "15": "You, however, shall join your forefathers in peace; you shall be buried at a contented old age.",
  "16": "In the fourth time-span the others shall come back here; the wickedness of the Amorites will not have reached its full measure until then.\"",
  "17": "When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking brazier and a flaming torch, which passed between those pieces.",
  "18": "It was on that occasion that the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: \"To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River (the Euphrates),",
  "19": "the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,",
  "20": "the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,",
  "21": "the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\""
