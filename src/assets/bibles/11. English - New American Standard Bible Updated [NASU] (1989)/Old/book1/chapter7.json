  "1": "Then the LORD said to Noah: \"Go into the ark, you and all your household, for you alone in this age have I found to be truly just.",

  "3": "likewise, of every clean bird of the air, seven pairs, a male and a female, and of all the unclean birds, one pair, a male and a female. Thus you will keep their issue alive over all the earth.",

  "9": "(two by two) male and female entered the ark with Noah, just as the LORD had commanded him.",
  "10": "As soon as the seven days were over, the waters of the flood came upon the earth.",
  "11": "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month: it was on that day that All the fountains of the great abyss burst forth, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.",
  "12": "For forty days and forty nights heavy rain poured down on the earth.",
  "13": "On the precise day named, Noah and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of Noah's sons had entered the ark,",

  "15": "Pairs of all creatures in which there was the breath of life entered the ark with Noah.",
  "16": "Those that entered were male and female, and of all species they came, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.",

  "21": "All creatures that stirred on earth perished: birds, cattle, wild animals, and all that swarmed on the earth, as well as all mankind.",
  "22": "Everything on dry land with the faintest breath of life in its nostrils died out.",
  "23": "The LORD wiped out every living thing on earth: man and cattle, the creeping things and the birds of the air; all were wiped out from the earth. Only Noah and those with him in the ark were left.",
  "24": "The waters maintained their crest over the earth for one hundred and fifty days,"
