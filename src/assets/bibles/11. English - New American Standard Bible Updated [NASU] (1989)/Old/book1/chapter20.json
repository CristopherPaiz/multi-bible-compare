  "1": "Abraham journeyed on to the region of the Negeb, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he stayed in Gerar,",
  "2": "he said of his wife Sarah, \"She is my sister.\" So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.",
  "3": "But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, \"You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she has a husband.\"",
  "4": "Abimelech, who had not approached her, said: \"O Lord, would you slay a man even though he is innocent?",
  "5": "He himself told me, 'She is my sister,' and she herself also stated, 'He is my brother.' I did it in good faith and with clean hands.\"",
  "6": "God answered him in the dream: \"Yes, I know you did it in good faith. In fact, it was I who kept you from sinning against me; that is why I did not let you touch her.",
  "7": "Therefore, return the man's wife-- as a spokesman he will intercede for you-- that your life may be saved. If you do not return her, you can be sure that you and all who are yours will certainly die.\"",
  "8": "Early the next morning Abimelech called all his court officials and informed them of everything that had happened, and the men were horrified.",
  "9": "Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him: \"How could you do this to us! What wrong did I do to you that you should have brought such monstrous guilt on me and my kingdom? You have treated me in an intolerable way.",
  "10": "What were you afraid of,\" he asked him, \"that you should have done such a thing?\"",
  "11": "\"I was afraid,\" answered Abraham, \"because I thought there would surely be no fear of God in this place, and so they would kill me on account of my wife.",
  "12": "Besides, she is in truth my sister, but only my father's daughter, not my mother's; and so she became my wife.",
  "13": "When God sent me wandering from my father's house, I asked her: 'Would you do me this favor? In whatever place we come to, say that I am your brother.'\"",
  "14": "Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham; and after he restored his wife Sarah to him,",
  "15": "he said, \"Here, my land lies at your disposal; settle wherever you please.\"",
  "16": "To Sarah he said: \"See, I have given your brother a thousand shekels of silver. Let that serve you as a vindication before all who are with you; your honor has been preserved with everyone.\"",
  "17": "Abraham then interceded with God, and God restored health to Abimelech, that is, to his wife and his maidservants, so that they could bear children;",
  "18": "for God had tightly closed every womb in Abimelech's household on account of Abraham's wife Sarah."
