  "3": "In the course of time Cain brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit of the soil,",
  "4": "while Abel, for his part, brought one of the best firstlings of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,",
  "5": "but on Cain and his offering he did not. Cain greatly resented this and was crestfallen.",
  "6": "So the LORD said to Cain: \"Why are you so resentful and crestfallen?",
  "7": "If you do well, you can hold up your head; but if not, sin is a demon lurking at the door: his urge is toward you, yet you can be his master.\"",
  "8": "Cain said to his brother Abel, \"Let us go out in the field.\" When they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.",

  "10": "The LORD then said: \"What have you done! Listen: your brother's blood cries out to me from the soil!",
  "11": "Therefore you shall be banned from the soil that opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.",
  "12": "If you till the soil, it shall no longer give you its produce. You shall become a restless wanderer on the earth.\"",
  "13": "Cain said to the LORD: \"My punishment is too great to bear.",
  "14": "Since you have now banished me from the soil, and I must avoid your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, anyone may kill me at sight.\"",
  "15": "\"Not so!\" the LORD said to him. \"If anyone kills Cain, Cain shall be avenged sevenfold.\" So the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest anyone should kill him at sight.",
  "16": "Cain then left the LORD'S presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.",
  "17": "Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. Cain also became the founder of a city, which he named after his son Enoch.",

  "23": "Lamech said to his wives: \"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my utterance: I have killed a man for wounding me, a boy for bruising me.",
  "24": "If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.\"",
  "25": "Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son whom she called Seth. \"God has granted me more offspring in place of Abel,\" she said, \"because Cain slew him.\"",
