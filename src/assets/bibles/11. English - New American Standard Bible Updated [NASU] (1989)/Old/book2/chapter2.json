  "1": "Now a certain man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,",
  "2": "who conceived and bore a son. Seeing that he was a goodly child, she hid him for three months.",
  "3": "When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket, daubed it with bitumen and pitch, and putting the child in it, placed it among the reeds on the river bank.",
  "4": "His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.",
  "5": "Pharaoh's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her maids walked along the river bank. Noticing the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaid to fetch it.",
  "6": "On opening it, she looked, and lo, there was a baby boy, crying! She was moved with pity for him and said, \"It is one of the Hebrews' children.\"",
  "7": "Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, \"Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\"",
  "8": "\"Yes, do so,\" she answered. So the maiden went and called the child's own mother.",
  "9": "Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \"Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will repay you.\" The woman therefore took the child and nursed it.",
