  "10": "\"Blessed be the LORD,\" he said, \"who has rescued his people from the hands of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.",

  "17": "\"You are not acting wisely,\" his father-in-law replied.",
  "18": "\"You will surely wear yourself out, and not only yourself but also these people with you. The task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.",
  "19": "Now, listen to me, and I will give you some advice, that God may be with you. Act as the people's representative before God, bringing to him whatever they have to say.",
