  "4": "tell the Israelites: You have seen for yourselves how I treated the Egyptians and how I bore you up on eagle wings and brought you here to myself.",
  "5": "Therefore, if you hearken to my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my special possession, dearer to me than all other people, though all the earth is mine.",

  "23": "Moses said to the LORD, \"The people cannot go up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us to set limits around the mountain to make it sacred.\"",
