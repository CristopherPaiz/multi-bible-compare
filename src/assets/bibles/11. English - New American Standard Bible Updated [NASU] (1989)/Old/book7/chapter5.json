  "1": "On that day Deborah (and Barak, son of Abinoam,) sang this song:",

  "3": "Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I to the LORD will sing my song, my hymn to the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "4": "O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, The earth quaked and the heavens were shaken, while the clouds sent down showers.",
  "5": "Mountains trembled in the presence of the LORD, the One of Sinai, in the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "6": "In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of slavery caravans ceased: Those who traveled the roads went by roundabout paths.",
  "7": "Gone was freedom beyond the walls, gone indeed from Israel. When I, Deborah, rose, when I rose, a mother in Israel,",
  "8": "New gods were their choice; then the war was at their gates. Not a shield could be seen, nor a lance, among forty thousand in Israel!",
  "9": "My heart is with the leaders of Israel, nobles of the people who bless the LORD;",
  "10": "They who ride on white asses, seated on saddlecloths as they go their way;",
  "11": "Sing of them to the strains of the harpers at the wells, where men recount the just deeds of the LORD, his just deeds that brought freedom to Israel.",
  "12": "Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, strike up a song. Strength! arise, Barak, make despoilers your spoil, son of Abinoam.",
  "13": "Then down came the fugitives with the mighty, the people of the LORD came down for me as warriors.",
  "14": "From Ephraim, princes were in the valley; behind you was Benjamin, among your troops. From Machir came down commanders, from Zebulun wielders of the marshal's staff.",
  "15": "With Deborah were the princes of Issachar; Barak, too, was in the valley, his course unchecked. Among the clans of Reuben great were the searchings of heart.",
  "16": "Why do you stay beside your hearths listening to the lowing of the herds? Among the clans of Reuben great were the searchings of heart!",
  "17": "Gilead, beyond the Jordan, rests; why does Dan spend his time in ships? Asher, who dwells along the shore, is resting in his coves.",
  "18": "Zebulun is the people defying death; Naphtali, too, on the open heights!",
  "19": "The kings came and fought; then they fought, those kings of Canaan, At Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; no silver booty did they take.",
  "20": "From the heavens the stars, too, fought; from their courses they fought against Sisera.",
  "21": "The Wadi Kishon swept them away; a wadi..., the Kishon.",
  "22": "Then the hoofs of the horses pounded, with the dashing, dashing of his steeds.",
  "23": "\"Curse Meroz,\" says the LORD, \"hurl a curse at its inhabitants! For they came not to my help, as warriors to the help of the LORD.\"",
  "24": "Blessed among women be Jael, blessed among tent-dwelling women.",
  "25": "He asked for water, she gave him milk; in a princely bowl she offered curds.",
  "26": "With her left hand she reached for the peg, with her right, for the workman's mallet. She hammered Sisera, crushed his head; she smashed, stove in his temple.",
  "27": "At her feet he sank down, fell, lay still; down at her feet he sank and fell; where he sank down, there he fell, slain.",
  "28": "From the window peered down and wailed the mother of Sisera, from the lattice: \"Why is his chariot so long in coming? why are the hoofbeats of his chariots delayed?\"",
  "29": "The wisest of her princesses answers her, and she, too, keeps answering herself:",
  "30": "\"They must be dividing the spoil they took: there must be a damsel or two for each man, Spoils of dyed cloth as Sisera's spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil.\"",
  "31": "May all your enemies perish thus, O LORD! but your friends be as the sun rising in its might! And the land was at rest for forty years."
