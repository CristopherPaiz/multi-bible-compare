  "1": "There was a man in the mountain region of Ephraim whose name was Micah.",
  "2": "He said to his mother, \"The eleven hundred shekels of silver over which you pronounced a curse in my hearing when they were taken from you, are in my possession. It was I who took them; so now I will restore them to you.\"",
  "3": "When he restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she took two hundred of them and gave them to the silversmith, who made of them a carved idol overlaid with silver.",
  "4": "Then his mother said, \"May the LORD bless my son! I have consecrated the silver to the LORD as my gift in favor of my son, by making a carved idol overlaid with silver.\" It remained in the house of Micah.",
  "5": "Thus the layman Micah had a sanctuary. He also made an ephod and household idols, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.",
  "6": "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what he thought best.",
  "7": "There was a young Levite who had resided within the tribe of Judah at Bethlehem of Judah.",
  "8": "From that city he set out to find another place of residence. On his journey he came to the house of Micah in the mountain region of Ephraim.",
  "9": "Micah said to him, \"Where do you come from?\" He answered him, \"I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and am on my way to find some other place of residence.\"",
  "10": "\"Stay with me,\" Micah said to him. \"Be father and priest to me, and I will give you ten silver shekels a year, a set of garments, and your food.\"",
  "11": "So the young Levite decided to stay with the man, to whom he became as one of his own sons.",
  "12": "Micah consecrated the young Levite, who became his priest, remaining in his house.",
  "13": "Therefore Micah said, \"Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, since the Levite has become my priest.\""
