  "1": "The men of Ephraim gathered together and crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, \"Why do you go on to fight with the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house over you.\"",
  "2": "Jephthah answered them, \"My soldiers and I were engaged in a critical contest with the Ammonites. I summoned you, but you did not rescue me from their power.",
  "3": "When I saw that you would not effect a rescue, I took my life in my own hand and went on to the Ammonites, and the LORD delivered them into my power. Why, then, do you come up against me this day to fight with me?\"",
  "4": "Then Jephthah called together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim, whom they defeated; for the Ephraimites had said, \"You of Gilead are Ephraimite fugitives in territory belonging to Ephraim and Manasseh.\"",

  "12": "the Zebulunite Elon died and was buried in Elon in the land of Zebulun.",
  "13": "After him the Pirathonite Abdon, son of Hillel, judged Israel.",
  "14": "He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy saddle-asses. After having judged Israel for eight years,",
