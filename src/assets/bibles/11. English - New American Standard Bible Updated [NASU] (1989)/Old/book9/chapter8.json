  "1": "In his old age Samuel appointed his sons judges over Israel.",
  "2": "His first-born was named Joel, his second son, Abijah; they judged at Beer-sheba.",
  "3": "His sons did not follow his example but sought illicit gain and accepted bribes, perverting justice.",
  "4": "Therefore all the elders of Israel came in a body to Samuel at Ramah",
  "5": "and said to him, \"Now that you are old, and your sons do not follow your example, appoint a king over us, as other nations have, to judge us.\"",
  "6": "Samuel was displeased when they asked for a king to judge them. He prayed to the LORD, however,",
  "7": "who said in answer: \"Grant the people's every request. It is not you they reject, they are rejecting me as their king.",
  "8": "As they have treated me constantly from the day I brought them up from Egypt to this day, deserting me and worshiping strange gods, so do they treat you too.",
  "9": "Now grant their request; but at the same time, warn them solemnly and inform them of the rights of the king who will rule them.\"",
  "10": "Samuel delivered the message of the LORD in full to those who were asking him for a king.",
  "11": "He told them: \"The rights of the king who will rule you will be as follows: He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots and horses, and they will run before his chariot.",
  "12": "He will also appoint from among them his commanders of groups of a thousand and of a hundred soldiers. He will set them to do his plowing and his harvesting, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.",
  "13": "He will use your daughters as ointment-makers, as cooks, and as bakers.",
  "14": "He will take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials.",
  "15": "He will tithe your crops and your vineyards, and give the revenue to his eunuchs and his slaves.",
  "16": "He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best oxen and your asses, and use them to do his work.",
  "17": "He will tithe your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves.",
  "18": "When this takes place, you will complain against the king whom you have chosen, but on that day the LORD will not answer you.\"",
  "19": "The people, however, refused to listen to Samuel's warning and said, \"Not so! There must be a king over us.",
  "20": "We too must be like other nations, with a king to rule us and to lead us in warfare and fight our battles.\"",
  "21": "When Samuel had listened to all the people had to say, he repeated it to the LORD,",
  "22": "who then said to him, \"Grant their request and appoint a king to rule them.\" Samuel thereupon said to the men of Israel, \"Each of you go to his own city.\""
