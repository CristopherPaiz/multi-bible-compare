  "3": "When the people of Ashdod rose early the next morning, Dagon was lying prone on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they picked Dagon up and replaced him.",
  "4": "But the next morning early, when they arose, Dagon lay prone on the ground before the ark of the LORD, his head and hands broken off and lying on the threshold, his trunk alone intact.",
  "5": "For this reason, neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter the temple of Dagon tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this very day; they always step over it.",

  "10": "The ark of God was next sent to Ekron; but as it entered that city, the people there cried out, \"Why have they brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill us and our kindred?\"",
  "11": "Then they, too, sent a summons to all the Philistine lords and pleaded: \"Send away the ark of the God of Israel. Let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our kindred.\" A deadly panic had seized the whole city, since the hand of God had been very heavy upon it.",
  "12": "Those who escaped death were afflicted with hemorrhoids, and the outcry from the city went up to the heavens."
