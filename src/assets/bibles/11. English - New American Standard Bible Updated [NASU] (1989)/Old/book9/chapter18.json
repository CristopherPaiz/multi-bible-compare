  "7": "The women played and sang: \"Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\"",
  "8": "Saul was very angry and resentful of the song, for he thought: \"They give David ten thousands, but only thousands to me. All that remains for him is the kingship.\"",
  "9": "(And from that day on, Saul was jealous of David.",

  "18": "But David answered Saul: \"Who am I? And who are my kin or my father's clan in Israel that I should become the king's son-in-law?\"",
  "19": "However, when it was time for Saul's daughter Merob to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite instead.)",
  "20": "Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David, and it was reported to Saul, who was pleased at this,",
