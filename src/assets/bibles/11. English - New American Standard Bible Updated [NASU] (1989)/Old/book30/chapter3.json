  "2": "You alone have I favored, more than all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your crimes.",
  "3": "Do two walk together unless they have agreed?",
  "4": "Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from its den unless it has seized something?",
  "5": "Is a bird brought to earth by a snare when there is no lure for it? Does a snare spring up from the ground without catching anything?",
  "6": "If the trumpet sounds in a city, will the people not be frightened? If evil befalls a city, has not the LORD caused it?",
  "7": "Indeed, the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets.",
  "8": "The lion roars-- who will not be afraid! The Lord GOD speaks-- who will not prophesy!",
  "9": "Proclaim this in the castles of Ashdod, in the castles of the land of Egypt: \"Gather about the mountain of Samaria, and see the great disorders within her, the oppression in her midst.\"",

  "13": "Hear and bear witness against the house of Jacob, says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts:",
  "14": "On the day when I punish Israel for his crimes, I will visit also the altars of Bethel: The horns of the altar shall be broken off and fall to the ground.",
  "15": "Then will I strike the winter house and the summer house; The ivory apartments shall be ruined, and their many rooms shall be no more, says the LORD."
