  "1": "Woe to the city, rebellious and polluted, to the tyrannical city!",
  "2": "She hears no voice, accepts no correction; In the LORD she has not trusted, to her God she has not drawn near.",
  "3": "Her princes in her midst are roaring lions; Her judges are wolves of the night that have had no bones to gnaw by morning.",
  "4": "Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men; Her priests profane what is holy, and do violence to the law.",
  "5": "The LORD within her is just, who does no wrong; Morning after morning he renders judgment unfailingly, at dawn.",
  "6": "I have destroyed nations, their battlements are laid waste; I have made their streets deserted, with no one passing through; Their cities are devastated, with no man dwelling in them.",
  "7": "I said, \"Surely now you will fear me, you will accept correction\"; She should not fail to see all I have visited upon her. Yet all the more eagerly have they done all their corrupt deeds.",
  "8": "Therefore, wait for me, says the LORD, against the day when I arise as accuser; For it is my decision to gather together the nations, to assemble the kingdoms, In order to pour out upon them my wrath, all my blazing anger; For in the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be consumed.",
  "9": "For then I will change and purify the lips of the peoples, That they all may call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one accord;",
  "10": "From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia and as far as the recesses of the North, they shall bring me offerings.",
  "11": "On that day You need not be ashamed of all your deeds, your rebellious actions against me; For then will I remove from your midst the proud braggarts, And you shall no longer exalt yourself on my holy mountain.",
  "12": "But I will leave as a remnant in your midst a people humble and lowly, Who shall take refuge in the name of the LORD;",
  "13": "the remnant of Israel. They shall do no wrong and speak no lies; Nor shall there be found in their mouths a deceitful tongue; They shall pasture and couch their flocks with none to disturb them.",
  "14": "Shout for joy, O daughter Zion! sing joyfully, O Israel! Be glad and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!",
  "15": "The LORD has removed the judgment against you, he has turned away your enemies; The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst, you have no further misfortune to fear.",
  "16": "On that day, it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not, O Zion, be not discouraged!",
  "17": "The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a mighty savior; He will rejoice over you with gladness, and renew you in his love, He will sing joyfully because of you,",
  "18": "as one sings at festivals. I will remove disaster from among you, so that none may recount your disgrace.",
  "19": "Yes, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you; I will save the lame, and assemble the outcasts; I will give them praise and renown in all the earth, when I bring about their restoration.",
  "20": "At that time I will bring you home, and at that time I will gather you; For I will give you renown and praise, among all the peoples of the earth, When I bring about your restoration before your very eyes, says the LORD."
