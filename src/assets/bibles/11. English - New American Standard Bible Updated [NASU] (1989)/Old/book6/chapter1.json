  "5": "No one can withstand you while you live. I will be with you as I was with Moses: I will not leave you nor forsake you.",
  "6": "Be firm and steadfast, so that you may give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers I would give them.",

  "14": "Your wives, your children, and your livestock shall remain in the land Moses gave you here beyond the Jordan. But all the warriors among you must cross over armed ahead of your kinsmen and you must help them",
  "15": "until the LORD has settled your kinsmen, and they like you possess the land which the LORD, your God, is giving them. Afterward you may return and occupy your own land, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, has given you east of the Jordan.\"",
  "16": "\"We will do all you have commanded us,\" they answered Joshua, \"and we will go wherever you send us. We will obey you as completely as we obeyed Moses.",

  "18": "If anyone rebels against your orders and does not obey every command you give him, he shall be put to death. But be firm and steadfast.\""
