  "1": "My son, if you receive my words and treasure my commands,",
  "2": "Turning your ear to wisdom, inclining your heart to understanding;",
  "3": "Yes, if you call to intelligence, and to understanding raise your voice;",
  "4": "If you seek her like silver, and like hidden treasures search her out:",
  "5": "Then will you understand the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of God you will find;",
  "6": "For the LORD gives wisdom, from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;",
  "7": "He has counsel in store for the upright, he is the shield of those who walk honestly,",
  "8": "Guarding the paths of justice, protecting the way of his pious ones.",
  "9": "Then you will understand rectitude and justice, honesty, every good path;",
  "10": "For wisdom will enter your heart, knowledge will please your soul,",
  "11": "Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you;",
  "12": "Saving you from the way of evil men, from men of perverse speech,",
  "13": "Who leave the straight paths to walk in the way of darkness,",
  "14": "Who delight in doing evil, rejoice in perversity;",
  "15": "Whose ways are crooked, and devious their paths;",
  "16": "Saving you from the wife of another, from the adulteress with her smooth words,",
  "17": "Who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the pact with her God;",
  "18": "For her path sinks down to death, and her footsteps lead to the shades;",
  "19": "None who enter thereon come back again, or gain the paths of life.",
  "20": "Thus you may walk in the way of good men, and keep to the paths of the just.",
  "21": "For the upright will dwell in the land, the honest will remain in it;",
  "22": "But the wicked will be cut off from the land, the faithless will be rooted out of it."
