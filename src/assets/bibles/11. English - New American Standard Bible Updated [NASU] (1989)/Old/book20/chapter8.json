  "1": "Does not Wisdom call, and Understanding raise her voice?",
  "2": "On the top of the heights along the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand;",
  "3": "By the gates at the approaches of the city, in the entryways she cries aloud:",
  "4": "\"To you, O men, I call; my appeal is to the children of men.",
  "5": "You simple ones, gain resource, you fools, gain sense.",
  "6": "\"Give heed! for noble things I speak; honesty opens my lips.",
  "7": "Yes, the truth my mouth recounts, but the wickedness my lips abhor.",
  "8": "Sincere are all the words of my mouth, no one of them is wily or crooked;",
  "9": "All of them are plain to the man of intelligence, and right to those who attain knowledge.",
  "10": "Receive my instruction in preference to silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.",
  "11": "(For Wisdom is better than corals, and no choice possessions can compare with her.)",
  "12": "\"I, Wisdom, dwell with experience, and judicious knowledge I attain.",
  "13": "(The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;) Pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth I hate.",
  "14": "Mine are counsel and advice; Mine is strength; I am understanding.",
  "15": "By me kings reign, and lawgivers establish justice;",
  "16": "By me princes govern, and nobles; all the rulers of earth.",

  "19": "My fruit is better than gold, yes, than pure gold, and my revenue than choice silver.",
  "20": "On the way of duty I walk, along the paths of justice,",
  "21": "Granting wealth to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.",
  "22": "\"The LORD begot me, the first-born of his ways, the forerunner of his prodigies of long ago;",
  "23": "From of old I was poured forth, at the first, before the earth.",
  "24": "When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no fountains or springs of water;",
  "25": "Before the mountains were settled into place, before the hills, I was brought forth;",
  "26": "While as yet the earth and the fields were not made, nor the first clods of the world.",
  "27": "\"When he established the heavens I was there, when he marked out the vault over the face of the deep;",
  "28": "When he made firm the skies above, when he fixed fast the foundations of the earth;",
  "29": "When he set for the sea its limit, so that the waters should not transgress his command;",
  "30": "Then was I beside him as his craftsman, and I was his delight day by day, Playing before him all the while,",
  "31": "playing on the surface of his earth; and I found delight in the sons of men.",
  "32": "\"So now, O children, listen to me;",
  "33": "instruction and wisdom do not reject! Happy the man who obeys me, and happy those who keep my ways,",
  "34": "Happy the man watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts;",
  "35": "For he who finds me finds life, and wins favor from the LORD;",
  "36": "But he who misses me harms himself; all who hate me love death.\""
