  "1": "My son, if you have become surety to your neighbor, given your hand in pledge to another,",
  "2": "You have been snared by the utterance of your lips, caught by the words of your mouth;",
  "3": "So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's power: Go, hurry, stir up your neighbor!",
  "4": "Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids;",
  "5": "Free yourself as a gazelle from the snare, or as a bird from the hand of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, O sluggard, study her ways and learn wisdom;",
  "7": "For though she has no chief, no commander or ruler,",
  "8": "She procures her food in the summer, stores up her provisions in the harvest.",
  "9": "How long, O sluggard, will you rest? when will you rise from your sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest--",
  "11": "Then will poverty come upon you like a highway man, and want like an armed man.",
  "12": "A scoundrel, a villain, is he who deals in crooked talk.",
  "13": "He winks his eyes, shuffles his feet, makes signs with his fingers;",
  "14": "He has perversity in his heart, is always plotting evil, sows discord.",
  "15": "Therefore suddenly ruin comes upon him; in an instant he is crushed beyond cure.",
  "16": "There are six things the LORD hates, yes, seven are an abomination to him;",
  "17": "Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;",
  "18": "A heart that plots wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,",
  "19": "The false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.",
  "20": "Observe, my son, your father's bidding, and reject not your mother's teaching;",
  "21": "Keep them fastened over your heart always, put them around your neck;",
  "22": "When you lie down she will watch over you, and when you wake, she will share your concerns; wherever you turn, she will guide you.",
  "23": "For the bidding is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and a way to life are the reproofs of discipline;",
  "24": "To keep you from your neighbor's wife, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.",
  "25": "Lust not in your heart after her beauty, let her not captivate you with her glance!",
  "26": "For the price of a loose woman may be scarcely a loaf of bread, But if she is married, she is a trap for your precious life.",
  "27": "Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his garments not burned?",
  "28": "Or can a man walk on live coals, and his feet not be scorched?",
  "29": "So with him who goes in to his neighbor's wife-- none who touches her shall go unpunished.",
  "30": "Men despise not the thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry;",
  "31": "Yet if he be caught he must pay back sevenfold; all the wealth of his house he may yield up.",
  "32": "But he who commits adultery is a fool; he who would destroy himself does it.",
  "33": "A degrading beating will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away;",
  "34": "For vindictive is the husband's wrath, he will have no pity on the day of vengeance;",
  "35": "He will not consider any restitution, nor be satisfied with the greatest gifts."
