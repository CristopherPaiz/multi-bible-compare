  "1": "The words of Agur, son of Jakeh the Massaite: The pronouncement of mortal man: \"I am not God; I am not God, that I should prevail.",
  "2": "Why, I am the most stupid of men, and have not even human intelligence;",
  "3": "Neither have I learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy One.",
  "4": "Who has gone up to heaven and come down again-- who has cupped the wind in his hands? Who has bound up the waters in a cloak-- who has marked out all the ends of the earth? What is his name, what is his son's name, if you know it?\"",
  "5": "Every word of God is tested; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.",
  "6": "Add nothing to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be exposed as a deceiver.",
  "7": "Two things I ask of you, deny them not to me before I die:",
  "8": "Put falsehood and lying far from me, give me neither poverty nor riches; (provide me only with the food I need;)",
  "9": "Lest, being full, I deny you, saying, \"Who is the LORD?\" Or, being in want, I steal, and profane the name of my God.",
  "10": "Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you have to pay the penalty.",
  "11": "There is a group of people that curses its father, and blesses not its mother.",
  "12": "There is a group that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not purged of its filth.",
  "13": "There is a group-- how haughty their eyes! how overbearing their glance!",
  "14": "There is a group whose incisors are swords, whose teeth are knives, Devouring the needy from the earth, and the poor from among men.",
  "15": "The two daughters of the leech are, \"Give, Give.\" Three things are never satisfied, four never say, \"Enough!\"",
  "16": "The nether world, and the barren womb; the earth, that is never saturated with water, and fire, that never says, \"Enough!\"",
  "17": "The eye that mocks a father, or scorns an aged mother, Will be plucked out by the ravens in the valley; the young eagles will devour it.",
  "18": "Three things are too wonderful for me, yes, four I cannot understand:",
  "19": "The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, The way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a maiden.",
  "20": "Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats, wipes her mouth, and says, \"I have done no wrong.\"",
  "21": "Under three things the earth trembles, yes, under four it cannot bear up:",
  "22": "Under a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is glutted with food;",
  "23": "Under an odious woman when she is wed, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.",
  "24": "Four things are among the smallest on the earth, and yet are exceedingly wise:",
  "25": "Ants-- a species not strong, yet they store up their food in the summer;",
  "26": "Rock-badgers-- a species not mighty, yet they make their home in the crags;",
  "27": "Locusts-- they have no king, yet they migrate all in array;",
  "28": "Lizards-- you can catch them with your hands, yet they find their way into king's palaces.",
  "29": "Three things are stately in their stride, yes, four are stately in their carriage:",
  "30": "The lion, mightiest of beasts, who retreats before nothing;",
  "31": "The strutting cock, and the he-goat, and the king at the head of his people.",
  "32": "If you have foolishly been proud or presumptuous-- put your hand on your mouth;",
  "33": "For the stirring of milk brings forth curds, and the stirring of anger brings forth blood."
