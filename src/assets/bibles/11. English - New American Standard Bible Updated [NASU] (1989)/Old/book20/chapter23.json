  "1": "When you sit down to dine with a ruler, keep in mind who is before you;",
  "2": "And put a knife to your throat if you have a ravenous appetite.",
  "3": "Do not desire his delicacies; they are deceitful food.",
  "4": "Toil not to gain wealth, cease to be concerned about it;",
  "5": "While your glance flits to it, it is gone! for assuredly it grows wings, like the eagle that flies toward heaven.",
  "6": "Do not take food with a grudging man, and do not desire his dainties;",
  "7": "For in his greed he is like a storm. \"Eat and drink,\" he says to you, though his heart is not with you;",
  "8": "The little you have eaten you will vomit up, and you will have wasted your agreeable words.",
  "9": "Speak not for the fool's hearing; he will despise the wisdom of your words.",
  "10": "Remove not the ancient landmark, nor invade the fields of orphans;",
  "11": "For their redeemer is strong; he will defend their cause against you.",
  "12": "Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to words of knowledge.",
  "13": "Withhold not chastisement from a boy; if you beat him with the rod, he will not die.",
  "14": "Beat him with the rod, and you will save him from the nether world.",
  "15": "My son, if your heart be wise, my own heart also will rejoice;",
  "16": "And my inmost being will exult, when your lips speak what is right.",
  "17": "Let not your heart emulate sinners, but be zealous for the fear of the LORD always;",
  "18": "For you will surely have a future, and your hope will not be cut off.",
  "19": "Hear, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the right way.",
  "20": "Consort not with winebibbers, nor with those who eat meat to excess;",
  "21": "For the drunkard and the glutton come to poverty, and torpor clothes a man in rags.",
  "22": "Listen to your father who begot you, and despise not your mother when she is old.",
  "23": "Get the truth, and sell it not-- wisdom, instruction and understanding.",
  "24": "The father of a just man will exult with glee; he who begets a wise son will have joy in him.",
  "25": "Let your father and mother have joy; let her who bore you exult.",
  "26": "My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes keep to my ways.",
  "27": "For the harlot is a deep ditch, and the adulteress a narrow pit;",
  "28": "Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the faithless among men.",
  "29": "Who scream? Who shriek? Who have strife? Who have anxiety? Who have wounds for nothing? Who have black eyes?",
  "30": "Those who linger long over wine, those who engage in trials of blended wine.",
  "31": "Look not on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the glass. It goes down smoothly;",
  "32": "but in the end it bites like a serpent, or like a poisonous adder.",
  "33": "Your eyes behold strange sights, and your heart utters disordered thoughts;",
  "34": "You are like one now lying in the depths of the sea, now sprawled at the top of the mast.",
  "35": "\"They struck me, but it pained me not; They beat me, but I felt it not; When shall I awake to seek wine once again?\""
