  "1": "My son, to my wisdom be attentive, to my knowledge incline your ear,",
  "2": "That discretion may watch over you, and understanding may guard you.",
  "3": "The lips of an adulteress drip with honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;",
  "4": "But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, as sharp as a two-edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death, to the nether world her steps attain;",
  "6": "Lest you see before you the road to life, her paths will ramble, you know not where.",
  "7": "So now, O children, listen to me, go not astray from the words of my mouth.",
  "8": "Keep your way far from her, approach not the door of her house,",
  "9": "Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to a merciless one;",
  "10": "Lest strangers have their fill of your wealth, your hard-won earnings go to an alien's house;",
  "11": "And you groan in the end, when your flesh and your body are consumed;",
  "12": "And you say, \"Oh, why did I hate instruction, and my heart spurn reproof!",
  "13": "Why did I not listen to the voice of my teachers, nor to my instructors incline my ear!",
  "14": "I have all but come to utter ruin, condemned by the public assembly!\"",
  "15": "Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.",
  "16": "How may your water sources be dispersed abroad, streams of water in the streets?",
  "17": "Let your fountain be yours alone, not one shared with strangers;",
  "18": "And have joy of the wife of your youth,",
  "19": "your lovely hind, your graceful doe. Her love will invigorate you always, through her love you will flourish continually,",
  "20": "Why then, my son, should you go astray for another's wife and accept the embraces of an adulteress?",
  "21": "For each man's ways are plain to the LORD'S sight; all their paths he surveys;",
  "22": "By his own iniquities the wicked man will be caught, in the meshes of his own sin he will be held fast;",
  "23": "He will die from lack of discipline, through the greatness of his folly he will be lost."
