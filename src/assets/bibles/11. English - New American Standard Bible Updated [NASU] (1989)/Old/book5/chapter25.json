  "18": "how without fear of any god he harassed you along the way, weak and weary as you were, and cut off at the rear all those who lagged behind.",
  "19": "Therefore, when the LORD, your God, gives you rest from all your enemies round about in the land which he is giving you to occupy as your heritage, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens. Do not forget!"
