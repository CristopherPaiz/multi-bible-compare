  "3": "You shall do the same with his ass, or his garment, or anything else which your kinsman loses and you happen to find; you may not be unconcerned about them.",
  "4": "You shall not see your kinsman's ass or ox foundering on the road without showing concern about it; see to it that you help him lift it up.",
  "5": "\"A woman shall not wear an article proper to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's dress; for anyone who does such things is an abomination to the LORD, your God.",
  "6": "\"If, while walking along, you chance upon a bird's nest with young birds or eggs in it, in any tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting on them, you shall not take away the mother bird along with her brood;",

  "17": "and now brings monstrous charges against her, saying: I did not find your daughter a virgin. But here is the evidence of my daughter's virginity!' And they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the city.",
  "18": "Then these city elders shall take the man and chastise him,",
  "19": "besides fining him one hundred silver shekels, which they shall give to the girl's father, because the man defamed a virgin in Israel. Moreover, she shall remain his wife, and he may not divorce her as long as he lives.",
  "20": "\"But if this charge is true, and evidence of the girl's virginity is not found,",

  "25": "\"If, however, it is in the open fields that a man comes upon such a betrothed maiden, seizes her and has relations with her, the man alone shall die.",
  "26": "You shall do nothing to the maiden, since she is not guilty of a capital offense. This case is like that of a man who rises up against his neighbor and murders him:",
  "27": "it was in the open fields that he came upon her, and though the betrothed maiden may have cried out for help, there was no one to come to her aid.",
  "28": "\"If a man comes upon a maiden that is not betrothed, takes her and has relations with her, and their deed is discovered,",
