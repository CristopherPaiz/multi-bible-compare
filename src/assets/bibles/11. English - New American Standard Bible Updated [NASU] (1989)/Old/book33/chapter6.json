  "1": "Hear, then, what the LORD says: Arise, present your plea before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice!",
  "2": "Hear, O mountains, the plea of the LORD, pay attention, O foundations of the earth! For the LORD has a plea against his people, and he enters into trial with Israel.",
  "3": "O my people, what have I done to you, or how have I wearied you? Answer me!",
  "4": "For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, from the place of slavery I released you; And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.",
  "5": "My people, remember what Moab's King Balak planned, and how Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him... from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the just deeds of the LORD.",
  "6": "With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow before God most high? Shall I come before him with holocausts, with calves a year old?",
  "7": "Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with myriad streams of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my crime, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?",
  "8": "You have been told, O man, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do right and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God.",
  "9": "Hark! the LORD cries to the city. (It is wisdom to fear your name!) Hear, O tribe and city council,",
  "10": "Am I to bear any longer criminal hoarding and the meager ephah that is accursed?",
  "11": "Shall I acquit criminal balances, bags of false weights?",
  "12": "You whose rich men are full of violence, whose inhabitants speak falsehood with deceitful tongues in their heads!",
  "13": "Rather I will begin to strike you with devastation because of your sins.",
  "14": "You shall eat, without being satisfied, food that will leave you empty; What you acquire, you cannot save; what you do save, I will deliver up to the sword.",
  "15": "You shall sow, yet not reap, tread out the olive, yet pour no oil, and the grapes, yet drink no wine.",
  "16": "You have kept the decrees of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you have walked in their counsels; Therefore I will deliver you up to ruin, and your citizens to derision; and you shall bear the reproach of the nations."
