  "1": "And I said: Hear, you leaders of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel! Is it not your duty to know what is right,",
  "2": "you who hate what is good, and love evil? You who tear their skin from them, and their flesh from their bones!",
  "3": "They eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from them, and break their bones. They chop them in pieces like flesh in a kettle, and like meat in a caldron.",
  "4": "When they cry to the LORD, he shall not answer them; Rather shall he hide his face from them at that time, because of the evil they have done.",
  "5": "Thus says the LORD regarding the prophets who lead my people astray; Who, when their teeth have something to bite, announce peace, But when one fails to put something in their mouth, proclaim war against him.",
  "6": "Therefore you shall have night, not vision, darkness, not divination; The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them.",
  "7": "Then shall the seers be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; They shall cover their lips, all of them, because there is no answer from God.",
  "8": "But as for me, I am filled with power, with the spirit of the LORD, with authority and with might; To declare to Jacob his crimes and to Israel his sins.",
  "9": "Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel! You who abhor what is just, and pervert all that is right;",
  "10": "Who build up Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness!",
  "11": "Her leaders render judgment for a bribe, her priests give decisions for a salary, her prophets divine for money, While they rely on the LORD, saying, \"Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil can come upon us!\"",
  "12": "Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem reduced to rubble, And the mount of the temple to a forest ridge."
