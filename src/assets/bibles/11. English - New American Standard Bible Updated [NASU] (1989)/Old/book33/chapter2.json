  "3": "Therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I am planning against this race an evil from which you shall not withdraw your necks; Nor shall you walk with head high, for it will be a time of evil.",
  "4": "On that day a satire shall be sung over you, and there shall be a plaintive chant: \"Our ruin is complete, our fields are portioned out among our captors, The fields of my people are measured out, and no one can get them back!\"",
  "5": "Thus you shall have no one to mark out boundaries by lot in the assembly of the LORD.",

  "12": "I will gather you, O Jacob, each and every one, I will assemble all the remnant of Israel; I will group them like a flock in the fold, like a herd in the midst of its corral; they shall not be thrown into panic by men.",
  "13": "With a leader to break the path they shall burst open the gate and go out through it; Their king shall go through before them, and the LORD at their head."
