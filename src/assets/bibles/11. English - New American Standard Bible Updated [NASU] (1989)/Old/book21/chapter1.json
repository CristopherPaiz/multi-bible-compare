  "1": "The words of David's son, Qoheleth, king in Jerusalem:",
  "2": "Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth, vanity of vanities! All things are vanity!",
  "3": "What profit has man from all the labor which he toils at under the sun?",
  "4": "One generation passes and another comes, but the world forever stays.",
  "5": "The sun rises and the sun goes down; then it presses on to the place where it rises.",
  "6": "Blowing now toward the south, then toward the north, the wind turns again and again, resuming its rounds.",
  "7": "All rivers go to the sea, yet never does the sea become full. To the place where they go, the rivers keep on going.",
  "8": "All speech is labored; there is nothing man can say. The eye is not satisfied with seeing nor is the ear filled with hearing.",
  "9": "What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun.",
  "10": "Even the thing of which we say, \"See, this is new!\" has already existed in the ages that preceded us.",
  "11": "There is no remembrance of the men of old; nor of those to come will there be any remembrance among those who come after them.",
  "12": "I, Qoheleth, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,",
  "13": "and I applied my mind to search and investigate in wisdom all things that are done under the sun. A thankless task God has appointed for men to be busied about.",
  "14": "I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a chase after wind.",
  "15": "What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is missing cannot be supplied.",
  "16": "Though I said to myself, \"Behold, I have become great and stored up wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my mind has broad experience of wisdom and knowledge\";",
  "17": "yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind.",
  "18": "For in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and he who stores up knowledge stores up grief."
