  "1": "There is an appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens.",
  "2": "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot the plant.",
  "3": "A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build.",
  "4": "A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.",
  "5": "A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather them; a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embraces.",
  "6": "A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away.",
  "7": "A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak.",
  "8": "A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.",
  "9": "What advantage has the worker from his toil?",
  "10": "I have considered the task which God has appointed for men to be busied about.",
  "11": "He has made everything appropriate to its time, and has put the timeless into their hearts, without men's ever discovering, from beginning to end, the work which God has done.",
  "12": "I recognized that there is nothing better than to be glad and to do well during life.",
  "13": "For every man, moreover, to eat and drink and enjoy the fruit of all his labor is a gift of God.",
  "14": "I recognized that whatever God does will endure forever; there is no adding to it, or taking from it. Thus has God done that he may be revered.",

  "17": "And I said to myself, both the just and the wicked God will judge, since there is a time for every affair and on every work a judgment.",
  "18": "I said to myself: As for the children of men, it is God's way of testing them and of showing that they are in themselves like beasts.",
  "19": "For the lot of man and of beast is one lot; the one dies as well as the other. Both have the same life-breath, and man has no advantage over the beast; but all is vanity.",
  "20": "Both go to the same place; both were made from the dust, and to the dust they both return.",
  "21": "Who knows if the life-breath of the children of men goes upward and the life-breath of beasts goes earthward?",
  "22": "And I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to rejoice in his work; for this is his lot. Who will let him see what is to come after him?"
