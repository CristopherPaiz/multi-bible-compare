  "9": "In Samaria there was a prophet of the LORD by the name of Oded. He went out to meet the army returning to Samaria and said to them: \"It was because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah that he delivered them into your hands. You, however, have slaughtered them with a fury that has reached up to heaven.",
  "10": "And now you are planning to make the children of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves and bondwomen. Are not you yourselves, therefore, guilty of a crime against the LORD, your God?",
  "11": "Now listen to me: send back the captives you have carried off from among your brethren, for the burning anger of the LORD is upon you.\"",
  "12": "At this, some of the Ephraimite leaders, Azariah, son of Johanan, Berechiah, son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, son of Shallum, and Amasa, son of Hadlai, themselves stood up in opposition to those who had returned from the war.",

  "14": "Therefore the soldiers left their captives and the plunder before the princes and the whole assembly.",
  "15": "Then the men just named proceeded to help the captives.

  "22": "While he was already in distress, the same King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.",
  "23": "He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, saying, \"Since it was the gods of the kings of Aram who helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me also.\" However, they only caused further disaster to him and to all Israel.",
