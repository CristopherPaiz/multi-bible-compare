  "4": "He has worn away my flesh and my skin, he has broken my bones;",
  "5": "He has beset me round about with poverty and weariness;",
  "6": "He has left me to dwell in the dark like those long dead.",
  "7": "He has hemmed me in with no escape and weighed me down with chains;",
  "8": "Even when I cry out for help, he stops my prayer;",
  "9": "He has blocked my ways with fitted stones, and turned my paths aside.",
  "10": "A lurking bear he has been to me, a lion in ambush!",
  "11": "He deranged my ways, set me astray, left me desolate.",
  "12": "He bent his bow, and set me up as the target for his arrow.",
  "13": "He pierces my sides with shafts from his quiver.",
  "14": "I have become a laughingstock for all nations, their taunt all the day long;",
  "15": "He has sated me with bitter food, made me drink my fill of wormwood.",

  "30": "Let him offer his cheek to be struck, let him be filled with disgrace.",
  "31": "For the Lord's rejection does not last forever;",
  "32": "Though he punishes, he takes pity, in the abundance of his mercies;",
  "33": "He has no joy in afflicting or grieving the sons of men.",
