  "1": "How tarnished is the gold, how changed the noble metal; How the sacred stones lie strewn at every street corner!",
  "2": "Zion's precious sons, fine gold their counterpart, Now worth no more than earthen jars made by the hands of a potter!",
  "3": "Even the jackals bare their breasts and suckle their young; The daughter of my people has become as cruel as the ostrich in the desert.",
  "4": "The tongue of the suckling cleaves to the roof of its mouth in thirst; The babes cry for food, but there is no one to give it to them.",
  "5": "Those accustomed to dainty food perish in the streets; Those brought up in purple now cling to the ash heaps.",
  "6": "The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the penalty of Sodom, Which was overthrown in an instant without the turning of a hand.",
  "7": "Brighter than snow were her princes, whiter than milk, More ruddy than coral, more precious than sapphire.",
  "8": "Now their appearance is blacker than soot, they are unrecognized on the streets; Their skin shrinks on their bones, as dry as wood.",
  "9": "Better for those who perish by the sword than for those who die of hunger, Who waste away, as though pierced through, lacking the fruits of the field!",
  "10": "The hands of compassionate women boiled their own children, To serve them as mourners' food in the downfall of the daughter of my people.",
  "11": "The LORD has spent his anger, poured out his blazing wrath; He has kindled a fire in Zion that has consumed her foundations.",
  "12": "The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any of the world's inhabitants, That enemy or foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem.",
  "13": "Because of the sins of her prophets and the crimes of her priests, Who shed in her midst the blood of the just!--",
  "14": "They staggered blindly in the streets, soiled with blood, So that people could not touch even their garments:",
  "15": "\"Away you unclean!\" they cried to them, \"Away, away, do not draw near!\" If they left and wandered among the nations, nowhere could they remain.",
  "16": "The LORD himself has dispersed them, he regards them no more; He does not receive the priests with favor, nor show kindness to the elders.",
  "17": "Our eyes ever wasted away, looking in vain for aid; From our watchtower we watched for a nation that could not save us.",
  "18": "Men dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, and came; our time had expired.",
  "19": "Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the air, They harassed us on the mountains and waylaid us in the desert.",
  "20": "The anointed one of the LORD, our breath of life, was caught in their snares, He in whose shadow we thought we could live on among the nations.",
  "21": "Though you rejoice and are glad, O daughter Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz, To you also shall the cup be passed; you shall become drunk and naked.",
  "22": "Your chastisement is completed, O daughter Zion, he will not prolong your exile; But your wickedness, O daughter Edom, he will punish, he will lay bare your sins."
