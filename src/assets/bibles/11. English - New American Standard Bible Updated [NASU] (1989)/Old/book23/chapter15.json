  "1": "Oracle on Moab: Laid waste in a night, Ar of Moab is destroyed; Laid waste in a night, Kir of Moab is destroyed.",
  "2": "Up goes daughter Dibon to the high places to weep; Over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. Every head is shaved, every beard sheared off.",
  "3": "In the streets they wear sackcloth, lamenting and weeping; On the rooftops and in the squares everyone wails.",
  "4": "Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, they are heard as far as Jahaz. At this the loins of Moab tremble, his soul quivers within him;",
  "5": "The heart of Moab cries out, his fugitives reach Zoar (Eglath-shelishiyah). The ascent of Luhith they climb weeping; On the way to Horonaim they utter rending cries.",
  "6": "The waters of Nimrim have become a waste; The grass is withered, new growth is gone, nothing is green.",
  "7": "So now whatever they have acquired or stored away they carry across the Gorge of the Poplars,",
  "8": "For the cry has gone round the land of Moab; As far as Eglaim the wailing, and to Beer-elim, the wail.",
  "9": "The waters of Dimon are filled with blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon: Lions for those who are fleeing from Moab and for those who remain in the land!"
