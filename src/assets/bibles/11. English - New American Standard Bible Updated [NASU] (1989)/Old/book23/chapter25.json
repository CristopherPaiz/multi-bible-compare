  "1": "O LORD, you are my God, I will extol you and praise your name; For you have fulfilled your wonderful plans of old, faithful and true.",
  "2": "For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; The castle of the insolent is a city no more, nor ever to be rebuilt.",
  "3": "Therefore a strong people will honor you, fierce nations will fear you.",
  "4": "For you are a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in distress; Shelter from the rain, shade from the heat. As with the cold rain,",
  "5": "as with the desert heat, even so you quell the uproar of the wanton.",
  "6": "On this mountain the LORD of hosts will provide for all peoples A feast of rich food and choice wines, juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.",
  "7": "On this mountain he will destroy the veil that veils all peoples, The web that is woven over all nations;",
  "8": "he will destroy death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from all faces; The reproach of his people he will remove from the whole earth; for the LORD has spoken.",
  "9": "On that day it will be said: \"Behold our God, to whom we looked to save us! This is the LORD for whom we looked; let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!\"",
  "10": "For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trodden down as a straw is trodden down in the mire.",
  "11": "He will stretch forth his hands in Moab as a swimmer extends his hands to swim; He will bring low their pride as his hands sweep over them.",
  "12": "The high-walled fortress he will raze, and strike it down level with the earth, with the very dust."
