  "1": "For Zion's sake I will not be silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn and her victory like a burning torch.",

  "3": "You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the LORD, a royal diadem held by your God.",
  "4": "No more shall men call you \"Forsaken,\" or your land \"Desolate,\" But you shall be called \"My Delight,\" and your land \"Espoused.\" For the LORD delights in you, and makes your land his spouse.",
  "5": "As a young man marries a virgin, your Builder shall marry you; And as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride so shall your God rejoice in you.",

  "12": "They shall be called the holy people, the redeemed of the LORD, And you shall be called \"Frequented,\" a city that is not forsaken."
