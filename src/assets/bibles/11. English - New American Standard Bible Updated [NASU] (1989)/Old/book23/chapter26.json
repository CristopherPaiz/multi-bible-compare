  "1": "On that day they will sing this song in the land of Judah: \"A strong city have we; he sets up walls and ramparts to protect us.",
  "2": "Open up the gates to let in a nation that is just, one that keeps faith.",
  "3": "A nation of firm purpose you keep in peace; in peace, for its trust in you.\"",
  "4": "Trust in the LORD forever! For the LORD is an eternal Rock.",
  "5": "He humbles those in high places, and the lofty city he brings down; He tumbles it to the ground, levels it with the dust.",
  "6": "It is trampled underfoot by the needy, by the footsteps of the poor.",
  "7": "The way of the just is smooth; the path of the just you make level.",
  "8": "Yes, for your way and your judgments, O LORD, we look to you; Your name and your title are the desire of our souls.",
  "9": "My soul yearns for you in the night, yes, my spirit within me keeps vigil for you; When your judgment dawns upon the earth, the world's inhabitants learn justice.",
  "10": "The wicked man, spared, does not learn justice; in an upright land he acts perversely, and sees not the majesty of the LORD.",
  "11": "O LORD, your hand is uplifted, but they behold it not; Let them be shamed when they see your zeal for your people: let the fire prepared for your enemies consume them.",
  "12": "O LORD, you mete out peace to us, for it is you who have accomplished all we have done.",
  "13": "O LORD, our God, other lords than you have ruled us; it is from you only that we can call upon your name.",
  "14": "Dead they are, they have no life, shades that cannot rise; For you have punished and destroyed them, and wiped out all memory of them.",
  "15": "You have increased the nation, O LORD, increased the nation to your own glory, and extended far all the borders of the land.",
  "16": "O LORD, oppressed by your punishment, we cried out in anguish under your chastising.",
  "17": "As a woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pains, so were we in your presence, O LORD.",
  "18": "We conceived and writhed in pain, giving birth to wind; Salvation we have not achieved for the earth, the inhabitants of the world cannot bring it forth.",
  "19": "But your dead shall live, their corpses shall rise; awake and sing, you who lie in the dust. For your dew is a dew of light, and the land of shades gives birth.",
  "20": "Go, my people, enter your chambers, and close your doors behind you; Hide yourselves for a brief moment, until the wrath is past.",
  "21": "See, the LORD goes forth from his place, to punish the wickedness of the earth's inhabitants; The earth will reveal the blood upon her, and no longer conceal her slain."
