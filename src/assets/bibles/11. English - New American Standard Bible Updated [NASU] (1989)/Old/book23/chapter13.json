  "6": "Howl, for the day of the LORD is near; as destruction from the Almighty it comes.",
  "7": "Therefore all hands fall helpless, the bows of the young men fall from their hands. Every man's heart melts",
  "8": "in terror. Pangs and sorrows take hold of them, like a woman in labor they writhe; They look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.",
  "9": "Lo, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and burning anger; To lay waste the land and destroy the sinners within it!",
  "10": "The stars and constellations of the heavens send forth no light; The sun is dark when it rises, and the light of the moon does not shine.",

  "20": "She shall never be inhabited, nor dwelt in, from age to age; The Arab shall not pitch his tent there, nor shepherds couch their flocks.",

  "22": "Desert beasts shall howl in her castles, and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is near at hand and her days shall not be prolonged."
