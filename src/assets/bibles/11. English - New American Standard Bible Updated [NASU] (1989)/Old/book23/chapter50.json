  "1": "Thus says the LORD: Where is the bill of divorce with which I dismissed your mother? Or to which of my creditors have I sold you? It was for your sins that you were sold, for your crimes that your mother was dismissed.",
  "2": "Why was no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? Is my hand too short to ransom? Have I not the strength to deliver? Lo, with my rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; Their fish rot for lack of water, and die of thirst.",
  "3": "I clothe the heavens in mourning, and make sackcloth their vesture.",
  "4": "The Lord GOD has given me a well-trained tongue, That I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them. Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;",
  "5": "And I have not rebelled, have not turned back.",
  "6": "I gave my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who plucked my beard; My face I did not shield from buffets and spitting.",
  "7": "The Lord GOD is my help, therefore I am not disgraced; I have set my face like flint, knowing that I shall not be put to shame.",
  "8": "He is near who upholds my right; if anyone wishes to oppose me, let us appear together. Who disputes my right? Let him confront me.",
  "9": "See, the Lord GOD is my help; who will prove me wrong? Lo, they will all wear out like cloth, the moth will eat them up.",
  "10": "Who among you fears the LORD, heeds his servant's voice, And walks in darkness without any light, Trusting in the name of the LORD and relying on his God?",
  "11": "All of you kindle flames and carry about you fiery darts; Walk by the light of your own fire and by the flares you have burnt! This is your fate from my hand: you shall lie down in a place of pain."
