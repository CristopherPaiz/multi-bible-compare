  "1": "Lo, the LORD empties the land and lays it waste; he turns it upside down, scattering its inhabitants:",
  "2": "Layman and priest alike, servant and master, The maid as her mistress, the buyer as the seller, The lender as the borrower, the creditor as the debtor.",
  "3": "The earth is utterly laid waste, utterly stripped, for the LORD has decreed this thing.",
  "4": "The earth mourns and fades, the world languishes and fades; both heaven and earth languish.",
  "5": "The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants, who have transgressed laws, violated statutes, broken the ancient covenant.",
  "6": "Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants pay for their guilt; Therefore they who dwell on earth turn pale, and few men are left.",
  "7": "The wine mourns, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted groan.",
  "8": "Stilled are the cheerful timbrels, ended the shouts of the jubilant, stilled is the cheerful harp.",
  "9": "They cannot sing and drink wine; strong drink is bitter to those who partake of it.",
  "10": "Broken down is the city of chaos, shut against entry, every house.",
  "11": "In the streets they cry out for lack of wine; all joy has disappeared and cheer has left the land.",
  "12": "In the city nothing remains but ruin; its gates are battered and desolate.",
  "13": "Thus it is within the land, and among the peoples, As with an olive tree after it is beaten, as with a gleaning when the vintage is done.",
  "14": "These lift up their voice in acclaim; from the sea they proclaim the majesty of the LORD:",
  "15": "\"For this, in the coastlands, give glory to the LORD! In the coastlands of the sea, to the name of the LORD, the God of Israel!\"",
  "16": "From the end of the earth we hear songs: \"Splendor to the Just One!\" But I said, \"I am wasted, wasted away. Woe is me! The traitors betray: with treachery have the traitors betrayed!",
  "17": "Terror, pit, and trap are upon you, inhabitant of the earth;",
  "18": "He who flees at the sound of terror will fall into the pit; He who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap. For the windows on high will be opened and the foundations of the earth will shake.",
  "19": "The earth will burst asunder, the earth will be shaken apart, the earth will be convulsed.",
  "20": "The earth will reel like a drunkard, and it will sway like a hut; Its rebellion will weigh it down, until it falls, never to rise again.\"",
  "21": "On that day the LORD will punish the host of the heavens in the heavens, and the kings of the earth on the earth.",
  "22": "They will be gathered together like prisoners into a pit; They will be shut up in a dungeon, and after many days they will be punished.",
  "23": "Then the moon will blush and the sun grow pale, For the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, glorious in the sight of his elders."
