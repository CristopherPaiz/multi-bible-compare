  "1": "The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, had concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
  "2": "Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the LORD speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have disowned me!",
  "3": "An ox knows its owner, and an ass, its master's manger; But Israel does not know, my people has not understood.",
  "4": "Ah! sinful nation, people laden with wickedness, evil race, corrupt children! They have forsaken the LORD, spurned the Holy One of Israel, apostatized.",
  "5": "Where would you yet be struck, you that rebel again and again? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint.",
  "6": "From the sole of the foot to the head there is no sound spot: Wound and welt and gaping gash, not drained, or bandaged, or eased with salve.",
  "7": "Your country is waste, your cities burnt with fire; Your land before your eyes strangers devour (a waste, like Sodom overthrown)--",
  "8": "And daughter Zion is left like a hut in a vineyard, Like a shed in a melon patch, like a city blockaded.",
  "9": "Unless the LORD of hosts had left us a scanty remnant, We had become as Sodom, we should be like Gomorrah.",
  "10": "Hear the word of the LORD, princes of Sodom! Listen to the instruction of our God, people of Gomorrah!",
  "11": "What care I for the number of your sacrifices? says the LORD. I have had enough of whole-burnt rams and fat of fatlings; In the blood of calves, lambs and goats I find no pleasure.",
  "12": "When you come in to visit me, who asks these things of you?",
  "13": "Trample my courts no more! Bring no more worthless offerings; your incense is loathsome to me. New moon and sabbath, calling of assemblies, octaves with wickedness: these I cannot bear.",
  "14": "Your new moons and festivals I detest; they weigh me down, I tire of the load.",
  "15": "When you spread out your hands, I close my eyes to you; Though you pray the more, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood!",
  "16": "Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes; cease doing evil;",
  "17": "learn to do good. Make justice your aim: redress the wronged, hear the orphan's plea, defend the widow.",
  "18": "Come now, let us set things right, says the LORD: Though your sins be like scarlet, they may become white as snow; Though they be crimson red, they may become white as wool.",
  "19": "If you are willing, and obey, you shall eat the good things of the land;",
  "20": "But if you refuse and resist, the sword shall consume you: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken!",
  "21": "How has she turned adulteress, the faithful city, so upright! Justice used to lodge within her, but now, murderers.",
  "22": "Your silver is turned to dross, your wine is mixed with water.",
  "23": "Your princes are rebels and comrades of thieves; Each one of them loves a bribe and looks for gifts. The fatherless they defend not, and the widow's plea does not reach them.",
  "24": "Now, therefore, says the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will take vengeance on my foes and fully repay my enemies!",
  "25": "I will turn my hand against you, and refine your dross in the furnace, removing all your alloy.",
  "26": "I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as in the beginning; After that you shall be called city of justice, faithful city.",
  "27": "Zion shall be redeemed by judgment, and her repentant ones by justice.",
  "28": "Rebels and sinners alike shall be crushed, those who desert the LORD shall be consumed.",
  "29": "You shall be ashamed of the terebinths which you prized, and blush for the groves which you chose.",
  "30": "You shall become like a tree with falling leaves, like a garden that has no water.",
  "31": "The strong man shall turn to tow, and his work shall become a spark; Both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench the flames."
