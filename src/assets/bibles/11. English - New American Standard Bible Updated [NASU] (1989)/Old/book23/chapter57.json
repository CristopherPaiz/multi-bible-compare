  "1": "The just man perishes, but no one takes it to heart; Devout men are swept away, with no one giving it a thought. Though he is taken away from the presence of evil, the just man",
  "2": "enters into peace; There is rest on his couch for the sincere, straightforward man.",
  "3": "But you, draw near, you sons of a sorceress, adulterous, wanton race!",
  "4": "Of whom do you make sport, at whom do you open wide your mouth, and put out your tongue? Are you not rebellious children, a worthless race;",
  "5": "You who are in heat among the terebinths, under every green tree; You who immolate children in the wadies, behind the crevices in the cliffs?",
  "6": "Among the smooth stones of the wadi is your portion, these are your lot; To these you poured out libations, and brought offerings. Should I decide not to punish these things?",
  "7": "Upon a high and lofty mountain you made your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifice.",
  "8": "Behind the door and the doorpost you placed your indecent symbol. Deserting me, you spread out your high, wide bed; And of those whose embraces you love you carved the symbol and gazed upon it",
  "9": "While you approached the king with scented oil, and multiplied your perfumes; While you sent your ambassadors far away, down even to the nether world.",
  "10": "Though worn out by your many misdeeds, you never said, \"It is hopeless\"; New strength you found, and so you did not weaken.",

  "12": "I will expose your justice and your works;",
  "13": "They shall not help you when you cry out, nor save you in your distress. All these the wind shall carry off, the breeze shall bear away; But he who takes refuge in me shall inherit the land, and possess my holy mountain.",
  "14": "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove the stumbling blocks from my people's path.",
  "15": "For thus says he who is high and exalted, living eternally, whose name is the Holy One: On high I dwell, and in holiness, and with the crushed and dejected in spirit, To revive the spirits of the dejected, to revive the hearts of the crushed.",
  "16": "I will not accuse forever, nor always be angry; For their spirits would faint before me, the souls that I have made.",
  "17": "Because of their wicked avarice I was angry, and struck them, hiding myself in wrath, as they went their own rebellious way.",
  "18": "I saw their ways, but I will heal them and lead them; I will give full comfort to them and to those who mourn for them,",
  "19": "I, the Creator, who gave them life. Peace, peace to the far and the near, says the LORD; and I will heal them.",
  "20": "But the wicked are like the tossing sea which cannot be calmed, And its waters cast up mud and filth.",
  "21": "No peace for the wicked! says my God."
