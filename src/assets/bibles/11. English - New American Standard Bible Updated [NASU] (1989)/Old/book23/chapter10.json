  "7": "But this is not what he intends, nor does he have this in mind; Rather, it is in his heart to destroy, to make an end of nations not a few.",
  "8": "\"Are not my commanders all kings?\" he says,",
  "9": "\"Is not Calno like Carchemish, Or Hamath like Arpad, or Samaria like Damascus?",
  "10": "Just as my hand reached out to idolatrous kingdoms that had more images than Jerusalem and Samaria,",
  "11": "Just as I treated Samaria and her idols, shall I not do to Jerusalem and her graven images?\"",
  "12": "(But when the LORD has brought to an end all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the utterance of the king of Assyria's proud heart,",
  "13": "and the boastfulness of his haughty eyes. For he says:) \"By my own power I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am shrewd. I have moved the boundaries of peoples, their treasures I have pillaged, and, like a giant, I have put down the enthroned.",
  "14": "My hand has seized like a nest the riches of nations; As one takes eggs left alone, so I took in all the earth; No one fluttered a wing, or opened a mouth, or chirped!\"",
  "15": "Will the axe boast against him who hews with it? Will the saw exalt itself above him who wields it? As if a rod could sway him who lifts it, or a staff him who is not wood!",

  "17": "The Light of Israel will become a fire, Israel's Holy One a flame, That burns and consumes his briers and his thorns in a single day.",
  "18": "His splendid forests and orchards will be consumed, soul and body;",
  "19": "And the remnant of the trees in his forest will be so few, Like poles set up for signals, that any boy can record them.",
  "20": "On that day The remnant of Israel, the survivors of the house of Jacob, will no more lean upon him who struck them; But they lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.",
  "21": "A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.",
  "22": "For though your people, O Israel, were like the sand of the sea, Only a remnant of them will return; their destruction is decreed as overwhelming justice demands.",

  "24": "Therefore thus says the Lord, the GOD of hosts: O my people, who dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian, though he strikes you with a rod, and raises his staff against you.",
  "25": "For only a brief moment more, and my anger shall be over; but them I will destroy in wrath.",
