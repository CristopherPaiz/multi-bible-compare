  "1": "In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the train of his garment filling the temple.",
  "2": "Seraphim were stationed above; each of them had six wings: with two they veiled their faces, with two they veiled their feet, and with two they hovered aloft.",
  "3": "\"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts!\" they cried one to the other. \"All the earth is filled with his glory!\"",
  "4": "At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.",
  "5": "Then I said, \"Woe is me, I am doomed! For I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!\"",
  "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding an ember which he had taken with tongs from the altar.",
  "7": "He touched my mouth with it. \"See,\" he said, \"now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, your sin purged.\"",
  "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \"Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?\" \"Here I am,\" I said; \"send me!\"",
  "9": "And he replied: Go and say to this people: Listen carefully, but you shall not understand! Look intently, but you shall know nothing!",
  "10": "You are to make the heart of this people sluggish, to dull their ears and close their eyes; Else their eyes will see, their ears hear, their heart understand, and they will turn and be healed.",
  "11": "\"How long, O Lord?\" I asked. And he replied: Until the cities are desolate, without inhabitants, Houses, without a man, and the earth is a desolate waste.",
  "12": "Until the LORD removes men far away, and the land is abandoned more and more.",
  "13": "If there be still a tenth part in it, then this in turn shall be laid waste; As with a terebinth or an oak whose trunk remains when its leaves have fallen. (Holy offspring is the trunk.)"
