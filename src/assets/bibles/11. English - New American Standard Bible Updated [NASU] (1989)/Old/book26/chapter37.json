  "8": "I saw the sinews and the flesh come upon them, and the skin cover them, but there was no spirit in them.",

  "17": "Then join the two sticks together, so that they form one stick in your hand.",
  "18": "When your countrymen ask you, \"Will you not tell us what you mean by all this?\",",
  "19": "answer them: Thus says the Lord GOD: (I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and of the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will join to it the stick of Judah, making them a single stick; they shall be one in my hand.",

  "26": "I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will multiply them, and put my sanctuary among them forever.",
  "27": "My dwelling shall be with them; I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",
  "28": "Thus the nations shall know that it is I, the LORD, who make Israel holy, when my sanctuary shall be set up among them forever."
