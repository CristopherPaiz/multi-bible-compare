  "1": "As for you, son of man, raise a lamentation over the prince of Israel:",
  "2": "What a lioness was your mother, a lion of lions! Among young lions she couched to rear her whelps.",
  "3": "One whelp she raised up, a young lion he became; He learned to seize prey, men he devoured.",
  "4": "Then nations raised cries against him, in their pit he was caught; They took him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.",
  "5": "Then she saw that in vain she had waited, her hope was destroyed. She took another of her whelps, him she made a young lion.",
  "6": "He prowled among the lions, a young lion he became; He learned to seize prey, men he devoured;",
  "7": "He ravaged their strongholds, their cities he wasted. The land and all in it were appalled at the noise of his roar.",
  "8": "Nations laid out against him snares all about him; They spread their net to take him, in their pit he was caught.",
  "9": "They put him in a cage and took him away to the king of Babylon, So that his voice would not be heard on the mountains of Israel.",
  "10": "Your mother was like a vine planted by the water; Fruitful and branchy was she because of the abundant water.",
  "11": "One strong branch she put out as a royal scepter. Stately was her height amid the dense foliage; Notably tall was she with her many clusters.",
  "12": "But she was torn up in fury and flung to the ground; The east wind withered her up, her fruit was torn off; Then her strong branch withered up, fire devoured it.",
  "13": "So now she is planted in the desert, in a land dry and parched,",
  "14": "For fire came out of the branch and devoured her shoots; She is now without a strong branch, a ruler's scepter. This is a lamentation and serves as a lamentation."
