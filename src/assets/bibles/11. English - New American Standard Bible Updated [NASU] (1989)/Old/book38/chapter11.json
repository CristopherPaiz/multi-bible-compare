  "1": "Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars!",
  "2": "Wail, you cypress trees, for the cedars are fallen, the mighty have been despoiled. Wail, you oaks of Bashan, for the impenetrable forest is cut down!",
  "3": "Hark! the wailing of the shepherds, their glory has been ruined. Hark! the roaring of the young lions, the jungle of the Jordan is laid waste.",
  "4": "Thus said the LORD, my God: Shepherd the flock to be slaughtered.",
  "5": "For they who buy them slay them with impunity; while those who sell them say, \"Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich!\" Even their own shepherds do not feel for them.",
  "6": "(Nor shall I spare the inhabitants of the earth any more, says the LORD. Yes, I will deliver each of them into the power of his neighbor, or into the power of his king; they shall crush the earth, and I will not deliver it out of their power.)",
  "7": "So I became the shepherd of the flock to be slaughtered for the sheep merchants. I took two staffs, one of which I called \"Favor,\" and the other, \"Bonds,\" and I fed the flock.",
  "8": "In a single month I did away with the three shepherds. I wearied of them, and they behaved badly toward me.",
  "9": "\"I will not feed you,\" I said. \"What is to die, let it die; what is to perish, let it perish, and let those that are left devour one another's flesh.\"",
  "10": "Then I took my staff \"Favor\" and snapped it asunder, breaking off the covenant which I had made with all peoples;",
  "11": "that day it was broken off. The sheep merchants who were watching me understood that this was the word of the LORD.",
  "12": "I said to them, \"If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, let it go.\" And they counted out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.",
  "13": "But the LORD said to me, \"Throw it in the treasury, the handsome price at which they valued me.\" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury in the house of the LORD.",
  "14": "Then I snapped asunder my other staff, \"Bonds,\" breaking off the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.",
  "15": "The LORD said to me: This time take the gear of a foolish shepherd.",
  "16": "For I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will take no note of those that perish, nor seek the strays, nor heal the injured, nor feed what survives-- he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs!",
  "17": "Woe to my foolish shepherd who forsakes the flock! May the sword fall upon his arm and upon his right eye; Let his arm wither away entirely, and his right eye be blind forever!"
