  "3": "For behold, the days will come, says the LORD, when I will change the lot of my people (of Israel and Judah, says the LORD), and bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers; they shall have it as their possession.",
  "4": "These are the words which the LORD spoke to Israel and to Judah:",
  "5": "thus says the LORD: A cry of dismay we hear; fear reigns, not peace.",
  "6": "Inquire, and see: since when do men bear children? Why, then, do I see all these men, with their hands on their loins like women in childbirth? Why have all their faces turned deathly pale?",
  "7": "How mighty is that day-- none like it! A time of distress for Jacob, though he shall be saved from it.",
  "8": "On that day, says the LORD of hosts, \"I will break his yoke from off your necks and snap your bonds.\" Strangers shall no longer enslave them;",
  "9": "instead, they shall serve the LORD, their God, and David, their king, whom I will raise up for them.",

  "11": "for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you. I will make an end of all the nations among which I have scattered you; but of you I will not make an end. I will chastise you as you deserve, I will not let you go unpunished.",
  "12": "For thus says the LORD: Incurable is your wound, grievous your bruise;",
  "13": "There is none to plead your cause, no remedy for your running sore, no healing for you.",
  "14": "All your lovers have forgotten you, they do not seek you. I struck you as an enemy would strike, punished you cruelly;",
  "15": "Why cry out over your wound? your pain is without relief. Because of your great guilt, your numerous sins, I have done this to you.",
  "16": "Yet all who devour you shall be devoured, all your enemies shall go into exile. All who plunder you shall be plundered, all who pillage you I will hand over to pillage.",
  "17": "For I will restore you to health; of your wounds I will heal you, says the LORD. \"The outcast\" they have called you, \"with no avenger.\"",
  "18": "Thus says the LORD: See! I will restore the tents of Jacob, his dwellings I will pity; City shall be rebuilt upon hill, and palace restored as it was.",
  "19": "From them will resound songs of praise, the laughter of happy men. I will make them not few, but many; they will not be tiny, for I will glorify them.",
  "20": "His sons shall be as of old, his assembly before me shall stand firm; I will punish all his oppressors.",
  "21": "His leader shall be one of his own, and his rulers shall come from his kin. When I summon him, he shall approach me; how else should one take the deadly risk of approaching me? says the LORD.",
  "22": "You shall be my people, and I will be your God.",
  "23": "See, the storm of the LORD! His wrath breaks forth In a whirling storm that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.",
  "24": "The anger of the LORD will not abate until he has done and fulfilled what he has determined in his heart. When the time comes, you will fully understand."
