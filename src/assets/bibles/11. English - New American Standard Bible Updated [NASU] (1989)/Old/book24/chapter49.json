  "19": "As when a lion comes up from the thicket of Jordan to the permanent feeding grounds, So I, in an instant, will drive men off; and whom I choose I will establish there! For who is like me? who can call me to account? What shepherd can stand against me?",

  "25": "How can the city of glory be forsaken, the town of delight!",
  "26": "But now her young men shall fall in her streets, and all her warriors shall be stilled. On that day, says the LORD of hosts,",
  "27": "I will set fire to the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.",

  "31": "Rise up! set out against a nation that is at peace, that lives secure, says the LORD, That has no gates or bars, and dwells alone.",
