  "3": "Let the LORD, your God, show us what way we should take and what we should do.\"",
  "4": "Very well! the prophet Jeremiah answered them: I will pray to the LORD, your God, as you desire; whatever the LORD answers you, I will tell you; I will withhold nothing from you.",
  "5": "And they said to Jeremiah, \"May the LORD be our witness: we will truly and faithfully follow all the instructions the LORD, your God, will send us.",
