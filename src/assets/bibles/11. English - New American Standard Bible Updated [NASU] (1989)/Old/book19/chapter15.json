  "1": "A psalm of David. I LORD, who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy mountain?",
  "2": "Whoever walks without blame, doing what is right, speaking truth from the heart;",
  "3": "Who does not slander a neighbor, does no harm to another, never defames a friend;",
  "4": "Who disdains the wicked, but honors those who fear the LORD; Who keeps an oath despite the cost,",
  "5": "lends no money at interest, accepts no bribe against the innocent. III Whoever acts like this shall never be shaken."
