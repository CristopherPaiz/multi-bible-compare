  "1": "Bless the LORD, my soul! LORD, my God, you are great indeed! You are clothed with majesty and glory,",
  "2": "robed in light as with a cloak. You spread out the heavens like a tent;",
  "3": "you raised your palace upon the waters. You make the clouds your chariot; you travel on the wings of the wind.",
  "4": "You make the winds your messengers; flaming fire, your ministers.",
  "5": "You fixed the earth on its foundation, never to be moved.",
  "6": "The ocean covered it like a garment; above the mountains stood the waters.",
  "7": "At your roar they took flight; at the sound of your thunder they fled.",
  "8": "They rushed up the mountains, down the valleys to the place you had fixed for them.",
  "9": "You set a limit they cannot pass; never again will they cover the earth.",
  "10": "You made springs flow into channels that wind among the mountains.",
  "11": "They give drink to every beast of the field; here wild asses quench their thirst.",
  "12": "Beside them the birds of heaven nest; among the branches they sing.",
  "13": "You water the mountains from your palace; by your labor the earth abounds.",
  "14": "You raise grass for the cattle and plants for our beasts of burden. You bring bread from the earth,",
  "15": "and wine to gladden our hearts, Oil to make our faces gleam, food to build our strength.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon, which you planted.",
  "17": "There the birds build their nests; junipers are the home of the stork.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for wild goats; the rocky cliffs, a refuge for badgers.",
  "19": "You made the moon to mark the seasons, the sun that knows the hour of its setting.",
  "20": "You bring darkness and night falls, then all the beasts of the forest roam abroad.",
  "21": "Young lions roar for prey; they seek their food from God.",
  "22": "When the sun rises, they steal away and rest in their dens.",
  "23": "People go forth to their work, to their labor till evening falls.",
  "24": "How varied are your works, LORD! In wisdom you have wrought them all; the earth is full of your creatures.",
  "25": "Look at the sea, great and wide! It teems with countless beings, living things both large and small.",
  "26": "Here ships ply their course; here Leviathan, your creature, plays.",
  "27": "All of these look to you to give them food in due time.",
  "28": "When you give to them, they gather; when you open your hand, they are well filled.",
  "29": "When you hide your face, they are lost. When you take away their breath, they perish and return to the dust from which they came.",
  "30": "When you send forth your breath, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.",
  "31": "May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD be glad in these works!",
  "32": "If God glares at the earth, it trembles; if God touches the mountains, they smoke!",
  "33": "I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live.",
  "34": "May my theme be pleasing to God; I will rejoice in the LORD.",
  "35": "May sinners vanish from the earth, and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, my soul! Hallelujah!"
