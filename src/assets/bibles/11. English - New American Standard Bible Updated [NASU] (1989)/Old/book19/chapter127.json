  "1": "A song of ascents. Of Solomon. I Unless the LORD build the house, they labor in vain who build. Unless the LORD guard the city, in vain does the guard keep watch.",
  "2": "It is vain for you to rise early and put off your rest at night, To eat bread earned by hard toil-- all this God gives to his beloved in sleep.",
  "3": "Children too are a gift from the LORD, the fruit of the womb, a reward.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children born in one's youth.",
  "5": "Blessed are they whose quivers are full. They will never be shamed contending with foes at the gate."
