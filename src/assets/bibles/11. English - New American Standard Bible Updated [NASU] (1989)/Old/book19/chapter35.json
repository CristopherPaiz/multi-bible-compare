  "25": "Do not let them say in their hearts, \"Aha! Just what we wanted!\" Do not let them say, \"We have devoured that one!\"",
  "26": "Put to shame and confound all who relish my misfortune. Clothe with shame and disgrace those who lord it over me.",
  "27": "But let those who favor my just cause shout for joy and be glad. May they ever say, \"Exalted be the LORD who delights in the peace of his loyal servant.\"",
  "28": "Then my tongue shall recount your justice, declare your praise, all the day long."
