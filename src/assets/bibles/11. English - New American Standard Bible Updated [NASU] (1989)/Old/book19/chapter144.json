  "1": "Of David. I Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for battle, my fingers for war;",
  "2": "My safe guard and my fortress, my stronghold, my deliverer, My shield, in whom I trust, who subdues peoples under me.",
  "3": "LORD, what are mortals that you notice them; human beings, that you take thought of them?",
  "4": "They are but a breath; their days are like a passing shadow.",
  "5": "LORD, incline your heavens and come; touch the mountains and make them smoke.",
  "6": "Flash forth lightning and scatter my foes; shoot your arrows and rout them.",
  "7": "Reach out your hand from on high; deliver me from the many waters; rescue me from the hands of foreign foes.",
  "8": "Their mouths speak untruth; their right hands are raised in lying oaths.",
  "9": "O God, a new song I will sing to you; on a ten-stringed lyre I will play for you.",
  "10": "You give victory to kings; you delivered David your servant. From the menacing sword",
  "11": "deliver me; rescue me from the hands of foreign foes. Their mouths speak untruth; their right hands are raised in lying oaths.",
  "12": "May our sons be like plants well nurtured from their youth, Our daughters, like carved columns, shapely as those of the temple.",
  "13": "May our barns be full with every kind of store. May our sheep increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields; may our oxen be well fattened.",
  "14": "May there be no breach in the walls, no exile, no outcry in our streets.",
  "15": "Happy the people so blessed; happy the people whose God is the LORD."
