  "1": "A prayer of David. I Hear, LORD, my plea for justice; pay heed to my cry; Listen to my prayer spoken without guile.",
  "2": "From you let my vindication come; your eyes see what is right.",
  "3": "You have tested my heart, searched it in the night. You have tried me by fire, but find no malice in me. My mouth has not transgressed",
  "4": "as humans often do. As your lips have instructed me, I have kept the way of the law.",
  "5": "My steps have kept to your paths; my feet have not faltered.",
  "6": "I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your ear to me; hear my prayer.",
  "7": "Show your wonderful love, you who deliver with your right arm those who seek refuge from their foes.",
  "8": "Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings",
  "9": "from the violence of the wicked.",
  "10": "My ravenous enemies press upon me; they close their hearts, they fill their mouths with proud roaring.",
  "11": "Their steps even now encircle me; they watch closely, keeping low to the ground,",
  "12": "Like lions eager for prey, like young lions lurking in ambush.",
  "13": "Rise, O LORD, confront and cast them down; rescue me so from the wicked.",
  "14": "Slay them with your sword; with your hand, LORD, slay them; snatch them from the world in their prime. Their bellies are being filled with your friends; their children are satisfied too, for they share what is left with their young.",
  "15": "I am just-- let me see your face; when I awake, let me be filled with your presence."
