  "1": "A psalm of Asaph. How good God is to the upright, the Lord, to those who are clean of heart!",
  "2": "But, as for me, I lost my balance; my feet all but slipped,",
  "3": "Because I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.",
  "4": "For they suffer no pain; their bodies are healthy and sleek.",
  "5": "They are free of the burdens of life; they are not afflicted like others.",
  "6": "Thus pride adorns them as a necklace; violence clothes them as a robe.",
  "7": "Out of their stupidity comes sin; evil thoughts flood their hearts.",
  "8": "They scoff and spout their malice; from on high they utter threats.",
  "9": "They set their mouths against the heavens, their tongues roam the earth.",
  "10": "So my people turn to them and drink deeply of their words.",
  "11": "They say, \"Does God really know?\" \"Does the Most High have any knowledge?\"",
  "12": "Such, then, are the wicked, always carefree, increasing their wealth.",
  "13": "Is it in vain that I have kept my heart clean, washed my hands in innocence?",
  "14": "For I am afflicted day after day, chastised every morning.",
  "15": "Had I thought, \"I will speak as they do,\" I would have betrayed your people.",
  "16": "Though I tried to understand all this, it was too difficult for me,",
  "17": "Till I entered the sanctuary of God and came to understand their end.",
  "18": "You set them, indeed, on a slippery road; you hurl them down to ruin.",
  "19": "How suddenly they are devastated; undone by disasters forever!",
  "20": "They are like a dream after waking, Lord, dismissed like shadows when you arise.",
  "21": "Since my heart was embittered and my soul deeply wounded,",
  "22": "I was stupid and could not understand; I was like a brute beast in your presence.",
  "23": "Yet I am always with you; you take hold of my right hand.",
  "24": "With your counsel you guide me, and at the end receive me with honor.",
  "25": "Whom else have I in the heavens? None beside you delights me on earth.",
  "26": "Though my flesh and my heart fail, God is the rock of my heart, my portion forever.",
  "27": "But those who are far from you perish; you destroy those unfaithful to you.",
  "28": "As for me, to be near God is my good, to make the Lord GOD my refuge. I shall declare all your works in the gates of daughter Zion."
