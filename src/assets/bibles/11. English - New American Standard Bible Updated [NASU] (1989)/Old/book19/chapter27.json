  "1": "Of David I The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom do I fear? The LORD is my life's refuge; of whom am I afraid?",
  "2": "When evildoers come at me to devour my flesh, These my enemies and foes themselves stumble and fall.",

  "4": "One thing I ask of the LORD; this I seek: To dwell in the LORD'S house all the days of my life, To gaze on the LORD'S beauty, to visit his temple.",
  "5": "For God will hide me in his shelter in time of trouble, Will conceal me in the cover of his tent; and set me high upon a rock.",
  "6": "Even now my head is held high above my enemies on every side! I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and chant praise to the LORD.",
  "7": "Hear my voice, LORD, when I call; have mercy on me and answer me.",
  "8": "\"Come,\" says my heart, \"seek God's face\"; your face, LORD, do I seek!",

  "10": "Even if my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will take me in.",
  "11": "LORD, show me your way; lead me on a level path because of my enemies.",

  "13": "But I believe I shall enjoy the LORD'S goodness in the land of the living.",
  "14": "Wait for the LORD, take courage; be stouthearted, wait for the LORD!"
