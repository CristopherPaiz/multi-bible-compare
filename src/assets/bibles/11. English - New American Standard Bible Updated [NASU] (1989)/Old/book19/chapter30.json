  "1": "A psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David.",

  "4": "LORD, you brought me up from Sheol; you kept me from going down to the pit.",
  "5": "Sing praise to the LORD, you faithful; give thanks to God's holy name.",

  "13": "With my whole being I sing endless praise to you. O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks."
