  "1": "A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.",
  "2": "O God, you are my God-- for you I long! For you my body yearns; for you my soul thirsts, Like a land parched, lifeless, and without water.",
  "3": "So I look to you in the sanctuary to see your power and glory.",
  "4": "For your love is better than life; my lips offer you worship!",
  "5": "I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands, calling on your name.",
  "6": "My soul shall savor the rich banquet of praise, with joyous lips my mouth shall honor you!",
  "7": "When I think of you upon my bed, through the night watches I will recall",
  "8": "That you indeed are my help, and in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy.",
  "9": "My soul clings fast to you; your right hand upholds me.",
  "10": "But those who seek my life will come to ruin; they shall go down to the depths of the earth!",
  "11": "They shall be handed over to the sword and become the prey of jackals!",
  "12": "But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by the Lord shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut!"
