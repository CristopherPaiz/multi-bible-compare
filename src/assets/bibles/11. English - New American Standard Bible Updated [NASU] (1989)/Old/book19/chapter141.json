  "1": "A psalm of David. LORD, I call to you; come quickly to help me; listen to my plea when I call.",
  "2": "Let my prayer be incense before you; my uplifted hands an evening sacrifice.",
  "3": "Set a guard, LORD, before my mouth, a gatekeeper at my lips.",
  "4": "Do not let my heart incline to evil, or yield to any sin. I will never feast upon the fine food of evildoers.",
  "5": "Let the just strike me; that is kindness; let them rebuke me; that is oil for my head. All this I shall not refuse, but will pray despite these trials.",
  "6": "When their leaders are cast over the cliff, all will learn that my prayers were heard.",
  "7": "As when a farmer plows a field into broken clods, so their bones will be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.",
  "8": "My eyes are upon you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I take refuge; do not strip me of life.",
  "9": "Guard me from the trap they have set for me, from the snares of evildoers.",
  "10": "Into their own nets let all the wicked fall, while I make good my own escape."
