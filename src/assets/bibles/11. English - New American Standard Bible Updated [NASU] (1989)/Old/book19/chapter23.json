  "1": "A psalm of David. I The LORD is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack.",
  "2": "In green pastures you let me graze; to safe waters you lead me;",
  "3": "you restore my strength. You guide me along the right path for the sake of your name.",
  "4": "Even when I walk through a dark valley, I fear no harm for you are at my side; your rod and staff give me courage.",
  "5": "You set a table before me as my enemies watch; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.",
  "6": "Only goodness and love will pursue me all the days of my life; I will dwell in the house of the LORD for years to come."
