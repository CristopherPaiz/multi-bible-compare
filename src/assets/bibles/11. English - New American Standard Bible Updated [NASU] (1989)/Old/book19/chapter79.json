  "1": "A psalm of Asaph. I O God, the nations have invaded your heritage; they have defiled your holy temple, have laid Jerusalem in ruins.",
  "2": "They have left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of your faithful for the beasts of the earth.",
  "3": "They have spilled their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and no one is left to bury them.",
  "4": "We have become the reproach of our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.",
  "5": "How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your rage keep burning like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out your wrath on nations that reject you, on kingdoms that do not call on your name,",
  "7": "For they have devoured Jacob, laid waste his home.",
  "8": "Do not hold past iniquities against us; may your compassion come quickly, for we have been brought very low.",
  "9": "Help us, God our savior, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, pardon our sins for your name's sake.",
  "10": "Why should the nations say, \"Where is their God?\" Before our eyes make clear to the nations that you avenge the blood of your servants.",
  "11": "Let the groans of prisoners come before you; by your great power free those doomed to death.",
  "12": "Lord, inflict on our neighbors seven fold the disgrace they inflicted on you.",
  "13": "Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; through all ages we will declare your praise."
