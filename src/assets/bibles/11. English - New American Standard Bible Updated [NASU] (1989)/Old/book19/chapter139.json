  "1": "For the leader. A psalm of David. I LORD, you have probed me, you know me:",
  "2": "you know when I sit and stand; you understand my thoughts from afar.",
  "3": "My travels and my rest you mark; with all my ways you are familiar.",
  "4": "Even before a word is on my tongue, LORD, you know it all.",
  "5": "Behind and before you encircle me and rest your hand upon me.",
  "6": "Such knowledge is beyond me, far too lofty for me to reach.",
  "7": "Where can I hide from your spirit? From your presence, where can I flee?",
  "8": "If I ascend to the heavens, you are there; if I lie down in Sheol, you are there too.",
  "9": "If I fly with the wings of dawn and alight beyond the sea,",
  "10": "Even there your hand will guide me, your right hand hold me fast.",
  "11": "If I say, \"Surely darkness shall hide me, and night shall be my light\"--",
  "12": "Darkness is not dark for you, and night shines as the day. Darkness and light are but one.",
  "13": "You formed my inmost being; you knit me in my mother's womb.",
  "14": "I praise you, so wonderfully you made me; wonderful are your works! My very self you knew;",
  "15": "my bones were not hidden from you, When I was being made in secret, fashioned as in the depths of the earth.",
  "16": "Your eyes foresaw my actions; in your book all are written down; my days were shaped, before one came to be.",
  "17": "How precious to me are your designs, O God; how vast the sum of them!",
  "18": "Were I to count, they would outnumber the sands; to finish, I would need eternity.",
  "19": "If only you would destroy the wicked, O God, and the bloodthirsty would depart from me!",
  "20": "Deceitfully they invoke your name; your foes swear faithless oaths.",
  "21": "Do I not hate, LORD, those who hate you? Those who rise against you, do I not loathe?",
  "22": "With fierce hatred I hate them, enemies I count as my own.",
  "23": "Probe me, God, know my heart; try me, know my concerns.",
  "24": "See if my way is crooked, then lead me in the ancient paths."
