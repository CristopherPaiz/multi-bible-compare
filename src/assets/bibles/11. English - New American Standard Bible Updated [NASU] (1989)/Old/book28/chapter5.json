  "1": "Hear this, O priests, Pay attention, O house of Israel, O household of the king, give ear! It is you who are called to judgment. For you have become a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.",
  "2": "In their perversity they have sunk into wickedness, and I am rejected by them all.",
  "3": "I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; Now Ephraim has played the harlot, Israel is defiled.",
  "4": "Their deeds do not allow them to return to their God; For the spirit of harlotry is in them, and they do not recognize the LORD.",
  "5": "The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him; Ephraim stumbles in his guilt, and Judah stumbles with them.",
  "6": "With their flocks and their herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they shall not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.",

  "15": "I will go back to my place until they pay for their guilt and seek my presence."
