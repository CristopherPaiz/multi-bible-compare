  "1": "When I would bring about the restoration of my people, when I would heal Israel, The guilt of Ephraim stands out, the wickedness of Samaria; They practice falsehood, thieves break in, bandits plunder abroad.",
  "2": "Yet they do not remind themselves that I remember all their wickedness. Even now their crimes surround them, present to my sight.",
  "3": "In their wickedness they regale the king, the princes too, with their deceits.",
  "4": "They are all kindled to wrath like a blazing oven, Whose fire the baker desists from stirring once the dough is kneaded until it has risen.",
  "5": "On the day of our king, the princes are overcome with the heat of wine. He extends his hand among dissemblers;",
  "6": "the plotters approach with hearts like ovens. All the night their anger sleeps; in the morning it flares like a blazing fire.",
  "7": "They are all heated like ovens, and consume their rulers. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls upon me.",

  "13": "Woe to them, they have strayed from me! Ruin to them, they have sinned against me! Though I wished to redeem them, they spoke lies against me.",
  "14": "They have not cried to me from their hearts when they wailed upon their beds; For wheat and wine they lacerated themselves, while they rebelled against me.",
  "15": "Though I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devised evil against me.",
  "16": "They have again become useless, like a treacherous bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongues; thus they shall be mocked in the land of Egypt."
