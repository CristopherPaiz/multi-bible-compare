  "2": "The more I called them, the farther they went from me, Sacrificing to the Baals and burning incense to idols.",
  "3": "Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, who took them in my arms;",
  "4": "I drew them with human cords, with bands of love; I fostered them like one who raises an infant to his cheeks; Yet, though I stooped to feed my child, they did not know that I was their healer.",

  "6": "The sword shall begin with his cities and end by consuming his solitudes. Because they refused to repent, their own counsels shall devour them.",
  "7": "His people are in suspense about returning to him; and God, though in unison they cry out to him, shall not raise them up.",
  "8": "How could I give you up, O Ephraim, or deliver you up, O Israel? How could I treat you as Admah, or make you like Zeboiim? My heart is overwhelmed, my pity is stirred.",
  "9": "I will not give vent to my blazing anger, I will not destroy Ephraim again; For I am God and not man, the Holy One present among you; I will not let the flames consume you.",
  "10": "They shall follow the LORD, who roars like a lion; When he roars, his sons shall come frightened from the west,",
  "11": "Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like sparrows, from the land of Assyria, like doves; And I will resettle them in their homes, says the LORD."
