  "1": "Israel is a luxuriant vine whose fruit matches its growth. The more abundant his fruit, the more altars he built; The more productive his land, the more sacred pillars he set up.",
  "2": "Their heart is false, now they pay for their guilt; God shall break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars.",
  "3": "If they would say, \"We have no king\"-- Since they do not fear the LORD, what can the king do for them?",
  "4": "Nothing but make promises, swear false oaths, and make alliances, While justice grows wild like wormwood in a plowed field!",

  "13": "But you have cultivated wickedness, reaped perversity, and eaten the fruit of falsehood. Because you have trusted in your chariots, and in your many warriors,",
  "14": "Turmoil shall break out among your tribes and all your fortresses shall be ravaged As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel in time of war, smashing mothers and their children.",
  "15": "So shall it be done to you, Bethel, because of your utter wickedness: At dawn the king of Israel shall perish utterly."
