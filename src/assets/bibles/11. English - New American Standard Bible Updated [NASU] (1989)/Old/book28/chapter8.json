  "1": "A trumpet to your lips, You who watch over the house of the LORD! Since they have violated my covenant, and sinned against my law,",
  "2": "While to me they cry out, \"O, God of Israel, we know you!\"",
  "3": "The men of Israel have thrown away what is good; the enemy shall pursue them.",
  "4": "They made kings, but not by my authority; they established princes, but without my approval. With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves, to their own destruction.",
  "5": "Cast away your calf, O Samaria! my wrath is kindled against them; How long will they be unable to attain innocence in Israel?",
  "6": "The work of an artisan no god at all, Destined for the flames-- such is the calf of Samaria!",
  "7": "When they sow the wind, they shall reap the whirlwind; The stalk of grain that forms no ear can yield no flour; Even if it could, strangers would swallow it.",
  "8": "Israel is swallowed up; he is now among the nations a thing of no value.",
  "9": "They went up to Assyria-- a wild ass off on its own-- Ephraim bargained for lovers.",
  "10": "Even though they bargain with the nations, I will now gather an army; King and princes shall shortly succumb under the burden.",
  "11": "When Ephraim made many altars to expiate sin, his altars became occasions of sin.",
  "12": "Though I write for him my many ordinances, they are considered as a stranger's.",
  "13": "Though they offer sacrifice, immolate flesh and eat it, the LORD is not pleased with them. He shall still remember their guilt and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.",
  "14": "Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces. Judah, too, has fortified many cities, but I will send fire upon his cities, to devour their castles."
