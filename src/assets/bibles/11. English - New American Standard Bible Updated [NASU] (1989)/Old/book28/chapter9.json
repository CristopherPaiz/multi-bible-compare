  "1": "Rejoice not, O Israel, exult not like the nations! For you have been unfaithful to your God, loving a harlot's hire upon every threshing floor.",
  "2": "Threshing floor and wine press shall not nourish them, the new wine shall fail them.",
  "3": "They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria they shall eat unclean food.",
  "4": "They shall not pour libations of wine to the LORD, or proffer their sacrifices before him. Theirs will be like mourners' bread, that makes unclean all who eat of it; Such food as they have shall be for themselves; it cannot enter the house of the LORD.",
  "5": "What will you do on the festival day, the day of the LORD'S feast?",
  "6": "When they go from the ruins, Egypt shall gather them in, Memphis shall bury them. Weeds shall overgrow their silver treasures, and thorns invade their tents.",
  "7": "They have come, the days of punishment! they have come, the days of recompense! Let Israel know it! \"The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad!\" Because your iniquity is great, great, too, is your hostility.",
  "8": "A prophet is Ephraim's watchman with God, yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, hostility in the house of his God.",
  "9": "They have sunk to the depths of corruption, as in the days of Gibeah; He shall remember their iniquity and punish their sins.",
  "10": "Like grapes in the desert, I found Israel; Like the first fruits of the fig tree in its prime, I considered your fathers. When they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to the Shame, they became as abhorrent as the thing they loved.",
  "11": "The glory of Ephraim flies away like a bird: no birth, no carrying in the womb, no conception. Were they to bear children, I would slay the darlings of their womb.",
  "12": "Even though they bring up their children, I will make them childless, till not one is left. Woe to them when I turn away from them!",
  "13": "Ephraim, as I saw, was like Tyre, planted in a beauteous spot; But Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.",
  "14": "Give them, O LORD! give them what? Give them an unfruitful womb, and dry breasts!",
  "15": "All their wickedness is in Gilgal; yes, there they incurred my hatred. Because of their wicked deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no longer; all their princes are rebels.",
  "16": "Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit.",
  "17": "My God will disown them because they have not listened to him; they shall be wanderers among the nations."
