  "1": "The word of the LORD which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.",
  "2": "Hear this, you elders! Pay attention, all you who dwell in the land! Has the like of this happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?",
  "3": "Tell it to your children, and your children to their children, and their children to the next generation.",
  "4": "What the cutter left, the locust swarm has eaten; What the locust swarm left, the grasshopper has eaten; And what the grasshopper left, the devourer has eaten.",
  "5": "Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you drinkers of wine, Because the juice of the grape will be withheld from your mouths.",
  "6": "For a people has invaded my land, mighty and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and his molars those of a lioness.",
  "7": "He has laid waste my vine, and blighted my fig tree; He has stripped it, sheared off its bark; its branches are made white.",
  "8": "Lament like a virgin girt with sackcloth for the spouse of her youth.",
  "9": "Abolished are offering and libation from the house of the LORD; In mourning are the priests, the ministers of the LORD.",
  "10": "The field is ravaged, the earth mourns, Because the grain is ravaged, the must has failed, the oil languishes.",
  "11": "Be appalled, you husbandmen! wail, you vinedressers! Over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.",
  "12": "The vine has dried up, the fig tree is withered; The pomegranate, the date palm also, and the apple, all the trees of the field are dried up; Yes, joy has withered away from among mankind.",
  "13": "Gird yourselves and weep, O priests! wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! The house of your God is deprived of offering and libation.",
  "14": "Proclaim a fast, call an assembly; Gather the elders, all who dwell in the land, Into the house of the LORD, your God, and cry to the LORD!",
  "15": "Alas, the day! for near is the day of the LORD, and it comes as ruin from the Almighty.",
  "16": "From before our very eyes has not the food been cut off; And from the house of our God, joy and gladness?",
  "17": "The seed lies shriveled under its clods; the stores are destroyed, The barns are broken down, for the grain has failed.",
  "18": "How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered! Because they have no pasturage, even the flocks of sheep have perished.",
  "19": "To you, O LORD, I cry! for fire has devoured the pastures of the plain, and flame has enkindled all the trees of the field.",
  "20": "Even the beasts of the field cry out to you; For the streams of water are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the plain."
