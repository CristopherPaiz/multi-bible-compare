  "1": "Therefore, O Job, hear my discourse, and hearken to all my words.",
  "2": "Behold, now I open my mouth; my tongue and my voice form words.",
  "3": "I will state directly what is in my mind, my lips shall utter knowledge sincerely;",
  "4": "For the spirit of God has made me, the breath of the Almighty keeps me alive.",
  "5": "If you are able, refute me; draw up your arguments and stand forth.",
  "6": "Behold I, like yourself, have been taken from the same clay by God.",
  "7": "Therefore no fear of me should dismay you, nor should my presence weigh heavily upon you.",
  "8": "But you have said in my hearing, as I listened to the sound of your words:",
  "9": "\"I am clean and without transgression; I am innocent; there is no guilt in me.",
  "10": "Yet he invents pretexts against me and reckons me as his enemy.",
  "11": "He puts my feet in the stocks; he watches all my ways!\"",
  "12": "In this you are not just, let me tell you; for God is greater than man.",
  "13": "Why, then, do you make complaint against him that he gives no account of his doings?",
  "14": "For God does speak, perhaps once, or even twice, though one perceive it not.",
  "15": "In a dream, in a vision of the night, (when deep sleep falls upon men) as they slumber in their beds,",
  "16": "It is then he opens the ears of men and as a warning to them, terrifies them;",
  "17": "By turning man from evil and keeping pride away from him,",
  "18": "He withholds his soul from the pit and his life from passing to the grave.",
  "19": "Or a man is chastened on his bed by pain and unceasing suffering within his frame,",
  "20": "So that to his appetite food becomes repulsive, and his senses reject the choicest nourishment.",
  "21": "His flesh is wasted so that it cannot be seen, and his bones, once invisible, appear;",
  "22": "His soul draws near to the pit, his life to the place of the dead.",
  "23": "If then there be for him an angel, one out of a thousand, a mediator, To show him what is right for him and bring the man back to justice,",
  "24": "He will take pity on him and say, \"Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found him a ransom.\"",
  "25": "Then his flesh shall become soft as a boy's; he shall be again as in the days of his youth.",
  "26": "He shall pray and God will favor him; he shall see God's face with rejoicing.",
  "27": "He shall sing before men and say, \"I sinned and did wrong, yet he has not punished me accordingly.",
  "28": "He delivered my soul from passing to the pit, and I behold the light of life.\"",
  "29": "Lo, all these things God does, twice, or thrice, for a man,",
  "30": "Bringing back his soul from the pit to the light, in the land of the living.",
  "31": "Be attentive, O Job; listen to me! Be silent and I will speak.",
  "32": "If you have aught to say, then answer me. Speak out! I should like to see you justified.",
  "33": "If not, then do you listen to me; be silent while I teach you wisdom."
