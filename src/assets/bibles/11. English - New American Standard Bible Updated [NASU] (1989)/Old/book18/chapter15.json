  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite spoke and said:",
  "2": "Should a wise man answer with airy opinions, or puff himself up with wind?",
  "3": "Should he argue in speech which does not avail, and in words which are to no profit?",
  "4": "You in fact do away with piety, and you lessen devotion toward God,",
  "5": "Because your wickedness instructs your mouth, and you choose to speak like the crafty.",
  "6": "Your own mouth condemns you, not I; your own lips refute you.",
  "7": "Are you indeed the first-born of mankind, or were you brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "Are you privy to the counsels of God, and do you restrict wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "What do you know that we do not know? What intelligence have you which we have not?",
  "10": "There are gray-haired old men among us more advanced in years than your father.",
  "11": "Are the consolations of God not enough for you, and speech that deals gently with you?",
  "12": "Why do your notions carry you away, and why do your eyes blink,",
  "13": "So that you turn your anger against God and let such words escape your mouth!",
  "14": "What is a man that he should be blameless, one born of woman that he should be righteous?",
  "15": "If in his holy ones God places no confidence, and if the heavens are not clean in his sight,",
  "16": "How much less so is the abominable, the corrupt: man, who drinks in iniquity like water!",
  "17": "I will show you, if you listen to me; what I have seen I will tell--",
  "18": "What wise men relate and have not contradicted since the days of their fathers,",
  "19": "To whom alone the land was given, when no foreigner moved among them.",
  "20": "The wicked man is in torment all his days, and limited years are in store for the tyrant;",
  "21": "The sound of terrors is in his ears; when all is prosperous, the spoiler comes upon him.",
  "22": "He despairs of escaping the darkness, and looks ever for the sword;",
  "23": "A wanderer, food for the vultures, he knows that his destruction is imminent.",
  "24": "By day the darkness fills him with dread; distress and anguish overpower him.",
  "25": "Because he has stretched out his hand against God and bade defiance to the Almighty,",
  "26": "One shall rush sternly upon him with the stout bosses of his shield, like a king prepared for the charge.",
  "27": "Because he has blinded himself with his crassness, padding his loins with fat,",
  "28": "He shall dwell in ruinous cities, in houses that are deserted, That are crumbling into clay",
  "29": "with no shadow to lengthen over the ground. He shall not be rich, and his possessions shall not endure;",
  "30": "A flame shall wither him up in his early growth, and with the wind his blossoms shall disappear.",
  "31": "for vain shall be his bartering.",
  "32": "His stalk shall wither before its time, and his branches shall be green no more.",
  "33": "He shall be like a vine that sheds its grapes unripened, and like an olive tree casting off its bloom.",
  "34": "For the breed of the impious shall be sterile, and fire shall consume the tents of extortioners.",
  "35": "They conceive malice and bring forth emptiness; they give birth to failure."
