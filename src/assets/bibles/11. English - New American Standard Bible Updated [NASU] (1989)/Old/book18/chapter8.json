  "1": "Bildad the Shuhite spoke out and said:",
  "2": "How long will you utter such things? The words from your mouth are like a mighty wind!",
  "3": "Does God pervert judgment, and does the Almighty distort justice?",
  "4": "If your children have sinned against him and he has left them in the grip of their guilt,",
  "5": "Still, if you yourself have recourse to God and make supplication to the Almighty,",
  "6": "Should you be blameless and upright, surely now he will awake for you and restore your rightful domain;",
  "7": "Your former state will be of little moment, for in time to come you will flourish indeed.",
  "8": "If you inquire of the former generations, and give heed to the experience of the fathers",
  "9": "(As we are but of yesterday and have no knowledge, because our days on earth are but a shadow),",
  "10": "Will they not teach you and tell you and utter their words of understanding?",
  "11": "Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the reed grass flourish without water?",

  "13": "So is the end of everyone who forgets God, and so shall the hope of the godless man perish.",
  "14": "His confidence is but a gossamer thread and his trust is a spider's web.",
  "15": "He shall rely upon his family, but it shall not last; he shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.",
  "16": "He is full of sap before sunrise, and beyond his garden his shoots go forth;",
  "17": "About a heap of stones are his roots entwined; among the rocks he takes hold.",
  "18": "Yet if one tears him from his place, it will disown him: \"I have never seen you!\"",
  "19": "There he lies rotting beside the road, and out of the soil another sprouts.",
  "20": "Behold, God will not cast away the upright; neither will he take the hand of the wicked.",
  "21": "Once more will he fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with rejoicing.",
  "22": "They that hate you shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked shall be no more."
