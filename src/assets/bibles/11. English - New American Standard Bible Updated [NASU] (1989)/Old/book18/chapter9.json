  "1": "Then Job answered and said:",
  "2": "I know well that it is so; but how can a man be justified before God?",
  "3": "Should one wish to contend with him, he could not answer him once in a thousand times.",
  "4": "God is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has withstood him and remained unscathed?",
  "5": "He removes the mountains before they know it; he overturns them in his anger.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars beneath it tremble.",
  "7": "He commands the sun, and it rises not; he seals up the stars.",
  "8": "He alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the crests of the sea.",
  "9": "He made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south;",
  "10": "He does great things past finding out, marvelous things beyond reckoning.",
  "11": "Should he come near me, I see him not; should he pass by, I am not aware of him;",
  "12": "Should he seize me forcibly, who can say him nay? Who can say to him, \"What are you doing?\"",
  "13": "He is God and he does not relent; the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him.",
  "14": "How much less shall I give him any answer, or choose out arguments against him!",
  "15": "Even though I were right, I could not answer him, but should rather beg for what was due me.",
  "16": "If I appealed to him and he answered my call, I could not believe that he would hearken to my words;",
  "17": "With a tempest he might overwhelm me, and multiply my wounds without cause;",
  "18": "He need not suffer me to draw breath, but might fill me with bitter griefs.",
  "19": "If it be a question of strength, he is mighty; and if of judgment, who will call him to account?",
  "20": "Though I were right, my own mouth might condemn me; were I innocent, he might put me in the wrong.",
  "21": "Though I am innocent, I myself cannot know it; I despise my life.",
  "22": "It is all one! therefore I say: Both the innocent and the wicked he destroys.",
  "23": "When the scourge slays suddenly, he laughs at the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges. If it is not he, who then is it?",
  "25": "My days are swifter than a runner, they flee away; they see no happiness;",
  "26": "They shoot by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping upon its prey.",
  "27": "If I say: I will forget my complaining, I will lay aside my sadness and be of good cheer,",
  "28": "Then I am in dread of all my pains; I know that you will not hold me innocent.",
  "29": "If I must be accounted guilty, why then should I strive in vain?",
  "30": "If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,",
  "31": "Yet you would plunge me in the ditch, so that my garments would abhor me.",
  "32": "For he is not a man like myself, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.",
  "33": "Would that there were an arbiter between us, who could lay his hand upon us both",
  "34": "and withdraw his rod from me. Would that his terrors did not frighten me;",
  "35": "that I might speak without being afraid of him. Since this is not the case with me,"
