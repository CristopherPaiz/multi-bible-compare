  "1": "Then Job replied and said:",
  "2": "No doubt you are the intelligent folk, and with you wisdom shall die!",
  "3": "But I have intelligence as well as you; for who does not know such things as these?",
  "4": "I have become the sport of my neighbors: \"The one whom God answers when he calls upon him, The just, the perfect man,\" is a laughing-stock;",
  "5": "The undisturbed esteem my downfall a disgrace such as awaits unsteady feet;",
  "6": "Yet the tents of robbers are prosperous, and those who provoke God are secure.",
  "7": "But now ask the beasts to teach you, and the birds of the air to tell you;",
  "8": "Or the reptiles on earth to instruct you, and the fish of the sea to inform you.",

  "11": "Does not the ear judge words as the mouth tastes food?",

  "16": "With him are strength and prudence; the misled and the misleaders are his.",
  "17": "He sends counselors away barefoot, and of judges he makes fools.",
  "18": "He loosens the bonds imposed by kings and leaves but a waistcloth to bind the king's own loins.",
  "19": "and lets their never-failing waters flow away.",
  "20": "He silences the trusted adviser, and takes discretion from the aged.",
  "21": "He breaks down the barriers of the streams",
  "22": "The recesses of the darkness he discloses, and brings the gloom forth to the light.",
  "23": "He makes nations great and he destroys them; he spreads peoples abroad and he abandons them.",
  "24": "He takes understanding from the leaders of the land,",
  "25": "till they grope in the darkness without light; he makes them stagger like drunken men."
