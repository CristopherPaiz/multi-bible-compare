  "1": "Then Job answered and said:",
  "2": "I have heard this sort of thing many times. Wearisome comforters are you all!",
  "3": "Is there no end to windy words? Or what sickness have you that you speak on?",
  "4": "I also could talk as you do, were you in my place. I could declaim over you, or wag my head at you;",
  "5": "I could strengthen you with talk, or shake my head with silent lips.",
  "6": "If I speak, this pain I have will not be checked; if I leave off, it will not depart from me.",
  "7": "But now that I am exhausted and stunned, all my company has closed in on me.",
  "8": "As a witness there rises up my traducer, speaking openly against me;",
  "9": "I am the prey his wrath assails, he gnashes his teeth against me. My enemies lord it over me;",
  "10": "their mouths are agape to bite me. They smite me on the cheek insultingly; they are all enlisted against me.",
  "11": "God has given me over to the impious; into the clutches of the wicked he has cast me.",
  "12": "I was in peace, but he dislodged me; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces. He has set me up for a target;",
  "13": "his arrows strike me from all directions, He pierces my sides without mercy, he pours out my gall upon the ground.",
  "14": "He pierces me with thrust upon thrust; he attacks me like a warrior.",
  "15": "I have fastened sackcloth over my skin, and have laid my brow in the dust.",
  "16": "My face is inflamed with weeping and there is darkness over my eyes,",
  "17": "Although my hands are free from violence, and my prayer is sincere.",
  "18": "O earth, cover not my blood, nor let my outcry come to rest!",
  "19": "Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my spokesman is on high.",
  "20": "My friends it is who wrong me; before God my eyes drop tears,",
  "21": "That he may do justice for a mortal in his presence and decide between a man and his neighbor.",
  "22": "For my years are numbered now, and I am on a journey from which I shall not return."
