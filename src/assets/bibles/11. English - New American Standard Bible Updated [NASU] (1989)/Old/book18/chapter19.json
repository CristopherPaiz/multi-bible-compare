  "1": "Then Job answered and said:",
  "2": "How long will you vex my soul, grind me down with words?",
  "3": "These ten times you have reviled me, have assailed me without shame!",
  "4": "Be it indeed that I am at fault and that my fault remains with me,",
  "5": "Even so, if you would vaunt yourselves against me and cast up to me any reproach,",
  "6": "Know then that God has dealt unfairly with me, and compassed me round with his net.",
  "7": "If I cry out \"Injustice!\" I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no redress.",
  "8": "He has barred my way and I cannot pass; he has veiled my path in darkness;",
  "9": "He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the diadem from my brow.",
  "10": "He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope he has uprooted like a tree.",
  "11": "His wrath he has kindled against me; he counts me among his enemies.",
  "12": "His troops advance as one man; they build up their road to attack me, and they encamp around my tent.",
  "13": "My brethren have withdrawn from me, and my friends are wholly estranged.",
  "14": "My kinsfolk and companions neglect me, and my guests have forgotten me.",
  "15": "Even my handmaids treat me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.",
  "16": "I call my servant, but he gives no answer, though in my speech I plead with him.",
  "17": "My breath is abhorred by my wife; I am loathsome to the men of my family.",
  "18": "The young children, too, despise me; when I appear, they speak against me.",
  "19": "All my intimate friends hold me in horror; those whom I loved have turned against me!",
  "20": "My bones cleave to my skin, and I have escaped with my flesh between my teeth.",
  "21": "Pity me, pity me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has struck me!",
  "22": "Why do you hound me as though you were divine, and insatiably prey upon me?",
  "23": "Oh, would that my words were written down! Would that they were inscribed in a record:",
  "24": "That with an iron chisel and with lead they were cut in the rock forever!",
  "25": "But as for me, I know that my Vindicator lives, and that he will at last stand forth upon the dust;",
  "26": "And from my flesh I shall see God; my inmost being is consumed with longing.",
  "27": "Whom I myself shall see: my own eyes, not another's, shall behold him,",
  "28": "But you who say, \"How shall we persecute him, seeing that the root of the matter is found in him?\"",
  "29": "Be afraid of the sword for yourselves, for these crimes deserve the sword; that you may know that there is a judgment."
