  "2": "But what is man's lot from God above, his inheritance from the Almighty on high?",
  "3": "Is it not calamity for the unrighteous, and woe for evildoers?",
  "4": "Does he not see my ways, and number all my steps?",
  "5": "If I have walked in falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit;",
  "6": "Let God weigh me in the scales of justice; thus will he know my innocence!",
  "7": "If my steps have turned out of the way, and my heart has followed my eyes, or any stain clings to my hands,",
  "8": "Then may I sow, but another eat of it, or may my planting be rooted up!",
  "9": "If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;",
  "10": "Then may my wife grind for another, and may others cohabit with her!",
  "11": "For that would be heinous, a crime to be condemned;",
  "12": "A fire that should burn down to the abyss till it consumed all my possessions to the roots.",
  "13": "Had I refused justice to my manservant or to my maid, when they had a claim against me,",
  "14": "What then should I do when God rose up; what could I answer when he demanded an account?",
  "15": "Did not he who made me in the womb make him? Did not the same One fashion us before our birth?",

  "17": "While I ate my portion alone, with no share in it for the fatherless,",
  "18": "Though like a father God has reared me from my youth, guiding me even from my mother's womb--",
  "19": "If I have seen a wanderer without clothing, or a poor man without covering,",
  "20": "Whose limbs have not blessed me when warmed with the fleece of my sheep;",
  "21": "If I have raised my hand against the innocent because I saw that I had supporters at the gate--",
  "22": "Then may my arm fall from the shoulder, my forearm be broken at the elbow!",
  "23": "For the dread of God will be upon me, and his majesty will overpower me.",
  "24": "Had I put my trust in gold or called fine gold my security;",

  "26": "Had I looked upon the sun as it shone, or the moon in the splendor of its progress,",
  "27": "And had my heart been secretly enticed to waft them a kiss with my hand;",
  "28": "This too would be a crime for condemnation, for I should have denied God above.",
  "29": "Had I rejoiced at the destruction of my enemy or exulted when evil fell upon him,",
  "30": "Even though I had not suffered my mouth to sin by uttering a curse against his life--",
  "31": "Had not the men of my tent exclaimed, \"Who has not been fed with his meat!\"",

  "33": "Had I, out of human weakness, hidden my sins and buried my guilt in my bosom",

  "36": "Surely, I should wear it on my shoulder or put it on me like a diadem;",
  "37": "Of all my steps I should give him an account; like a prince I should present myself before him. This is my final plea; let the Almighty answer me! The words of Job are ended.",
  "38": "If my land has cried out against me till its very furrows complained;",
  "39": "If I have eaten its produce without payment and grieved the hearts of its tenants;",
  "40": "Then let the thistles grow instead of wheat and noxious weeds instead of barley!"
