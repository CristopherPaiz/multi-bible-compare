  "1": "Then the three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.",
  "2": "But the anger of Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. He was angry with Job for considering himself rather than God to be in the right.",
  "3": "He was angry also with the three friends because they had not found a good answer and had not condemned Job.",
  "4": "But since these men were older than he, Elihu bided his time before addressing Job.",

  "6": "So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, spoke out and said: I am young and you are very old; therefore I held back and was afraid to declare to you my knowledge.",

  "18": "For I am full of matters to utter; the spirit within me compels me.",
  "19": "Like a new wineskin with wine under pressure, my bosom is ready to burst.",
  "20": "Let me speak and obtain relief; let me open my lips, and make reply.",
  "21": "I would not be partial to anyone, nor give flattering titles to any.",
  "22": "For I know nought of flattery; if I did, my Maker would soon take me away."
