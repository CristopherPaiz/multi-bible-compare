  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:",
  "2": "Can a man be profitable to God? Though to himself a wise man be profitable!",
  "3": "Is it of advantage to the Almighty if you are just? Or is it a gain to him if you make your ways perfect?",
  "4": "Is it because of your piety that he reproves you-- that he enters with you into judgment?",
  "5": "Is not your wickedness manifold? Are not your iniquities endless?",
  "6": "You have unjustly kept your kinsmen's goods in pawn, left them stripped naked of their clothing.",
  "7": "To the thirsty you have given no water to drink, and from the hungry you have withheld bread;",
  "8": "As if the land belonged to the man of might, and only the privileged were to dwell in it.",
  "9": "You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the resources of orphans you have destroyed.",
  "10": "Therefore snares are round about you, and a sudden terror causes you dismay,",
  "11": "Or darkness, in which you cannot see; a deluge of waters covers you.",
  "12": "Does not God, in the heights of the heavens, behold the stars, high though they are?",
  "13": "Yet you say, \"What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?",
  "14": "Clouds hide him so that he cannot see; he walks upon the vault of the heavens!\"",
  "15": "Do you indeed keep to the ancient way trodden by worthless men,",
  "16": "Who were snatched away before their time; whose foundations a flood swept away?",
  "17": "These men said to God, \"Depart from us!\" and, \"What can the Almighty do to us?\"",
  "18": "(Yet he had filled their houses with good things! But far be from me the mind of the impious!)",
  "19": "The just look on and are gladdened, and the innocent deride them:",
  "20": "\"Truly these have been destroyed where they stood, and such as were left, fire has consumed!\"",
  "21": "Come to terms with him to be at peace. In this shall good come to you:",
  "22": "Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; if you put iniquity far from your tent,",
  "24": "And treat raw gold like dust, and the fine gold of Ophir as pebbles from the brook,",
  "25": "Then the Almighty himself shall be your gold and your sparkling silver.",
  "26": "For then you shall delight in the Almighty and you shall lift up your face toward God.",
  "27": "You shall entreat him and he will hear you, and your vows you shall fulfill.",
  "28": "When you make a decision, it shall succeed for you, and upon your ways the light shall shine.",
  "29": "For he brings down the pride of the haughty, but the man of humble mien he saves.",
  "30": "God delivers him who is innocent; you shall be delivered through cleanness of hands."
