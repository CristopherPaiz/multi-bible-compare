  "1": "The LORD then said to Job:",
  "2": "Will we have arguing with the Almighty by the critic? Let him who would correct God give answer!",
  "3": "Then Job answered the LORD and said:",
  "4": "Behold, I am of little account; what can I answer you? I put my hand over my mouth.",
  "5": "Though I have spoken once, I will not do so again; though twice, I will do so no more.",
  "6": "Then the LORD addressed Job out of the storm and said:",
  "7": "Gird up your loins now, like a man. I will question you, and you tell me the answers!",
  "8": "Would you refuse to acknowledge my right? Would you condemn me that you may be justified?",
  "9": "Have you an arm like that of God, or can you thunder with a voice like his?",
  "10": "Adorn yourself with grandeur and majesty, and array yourself with glory and splendor.",
  "11": "Let loose the fury of your wrath;",
  "12": "tear down the wicked and shatter them. Bring down the haughty with a glance;",
  "13": "bury them in the dust together; in the hidden world imprison them.",
  "14": "Then will I too acknowledge that your own right hand can save you.",
  "15": "See, besides you I made Behemoth, that feeds on grass like an ox.",
  "16": "Behold the strength in his loins, and his vigor in the sinews of his belly.",
  "17": "He carries his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are like cables.",
  "18": "His bones are like tubes of bronze; his frame is like iron rods.",
  "19": "He came at the beginning of God's ways, and was made the taskmaster of his fellows;",
  "20": "For the produce of the mountains is brought to him, and of all wild animals he makes sport.",
  "21": "Under the lotus trees he lies, in coverts of the reedy swamp.",
  "22": "The lotus trees cover him with their shade; all about him are the poplars on the bank.",
  "23": "If the river grows violent, he is not disturbed; he is tranquil though the torrent surges about his mouth.",
  "24": "Who can capture him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a trap?",
  "25": "Can you lead about Leviathan with a hook, or curb his tongue with a bit?",
  "26": "Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce through his cheek with a gaff?",
  "27": "Will he then plead with you, time after time, or address you with tender words?",
  "28": "Will he make an agreement with you that you may have him as a slave forever?",
  "29": "Can you play with him, as with a bird? Can you put him in leash for your maidens?",
  "30": "Will the traders bargain for him? Will the merchants divide him up?",
  "31": "Can you fill his hide with barbs, or his head with fish spears?",
  "32": "Once you but lay a hand upon him, no need to recall any other conflict!"
