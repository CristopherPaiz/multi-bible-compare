  "2": "Oh, that I were as in the months past! as in the days when God watched over me,",

  "4": "As I was in my flourishing days, when God sheltered my tent;",
  "5": "When the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were round about me;",
  "6": "When my footsteps were bathed in milk, and the rock flowed with streams of oil;",
  "7": "When I went forth to the gate of the city and set up my seat in the square-",
  "8": "Then the young men saw me and withdrew, while the elders rose up and stood;",

  "21": "For me they listened and waited; they were silent for my counsel.",
  "22": "Once I spoke, they said no more, but received my pronouncement drop by drop.",
  "23": "They waited for me as for the rain; they drank in my words like the spring rains.",
  "24": "When I smiled on them they were reassured;",
  "25": "mourners took comfort from my cheerful glance. I chose out their way and presided; I took a king's place in the armed forces."
