  "1": "Man born of woman is short-lived and full of trouble,",
  "2": "Like a flower that springs up and fades, swift as a shadow that does not abide.",
  "3": "Upon such a one will you cast your eyes so as to bring him into judgment before you,",
  "4": "Can a man be found who is clean of defilement? There is none,",
  "5": "however short his days. You know the number of his months; you have fixed the limit which he cannot pass.",
  "6": "Look away from him and let him be, while, like a hireling, he completes his day.",
  "7": "For a tree there is hope, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again and that its tender shoots will not cease.",
  "8": "Even though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the dust,",
  "9": "Yet at the first whiff of water it may flourish again and put forth branches like a young plant.",
  "10": "But when a man dies, all vigor leaves him; when man expires, where then is he?",
  "11": "As when the waters of a lake fail, or a stream grows dry and parches,",
  "12": "So men lie down and rise not again. Till the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.",
  "13": "Oh, that you would hide me in the nether world and keep me sheltered till your wrath is past; would fix a time for me, and then remember me!",
  "14": "When a man has died, were he to live again, all the days of my drudgery I would wait, until my relief should come.",
  "15": "You would call, and I would answer you; you would esteem the work of your hands.",
  "16": "Surely then you would count my steps, and not keep watch for sin in me.",
  "17": "My misdeeds would be sealed up in a pouch, and you would cover over my guilt.",
  "18": "But as a mountain falls at last and its rock is moved from its place,",
  "19": "As waters wear away the stones and floods wash away the soil of the land, so you destroy the hope of man.",
  "20": "You prevail once for all against him and he passes on; with changed appearance you send him away.",
  "21": "If his sons are honored, he is not aware of it; if they are in disgrace, he does not know about them.",
  "22": "Only his own flesh pains him, and his soul grieves for him."
