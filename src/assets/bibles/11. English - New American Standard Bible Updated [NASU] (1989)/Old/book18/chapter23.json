  "1": "Again Job answered and said:",
  "2": "Though I know my complaint is bitter, his hand is heavy upon me in my groanings.",
  "3": "Oh, that today I might find him, that I might come to his judgment seat!",
  "4": "I would set out my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments;",
  "5": "I would learn the words with which he would answer, and understand what he would reply to me.",
  "6": "Even should he contend against me with his great power, yet, would that he himself might heed me!",
  "7": "There the upright man might reason with him, and I should once and for all preserve my rights.",
  "8": "But if I go to the east, he is not there; or to the west, I cannot perceive him;",
  "9": "Where the north enfolds him, I behold him not; by the south he is veiled, and I see him not.",
  "10": "Yet he knows my way; if he proved me, I should come forth as gold.",
  "11": "My foot has always walked in his steps; his way I have kept and have not turned aside.",
  "12": "From the commands of his lips I have not departed; the words of his mouth I have treasured in my heart.",

  "14": "For he will carry out what is appointed for me; and many such things may yet be in his mind.",
  "15": "Therefore am I dismayed before him; when I take thought, I fear him.",
  "16": "Indeed God has made my courage fail; the Almighty has put me in dismay.",
  "17": "Yes, would that I had vanished in darkness, and that thick gloom were before me to conceal me."
