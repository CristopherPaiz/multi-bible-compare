  "1": "After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.",
  "2": "Job spoke out and said:",
  "3": "Perish the day on which I was born, the night when they said, \"The child is a boy!\"",
  "4": "May that day be darkness: let not God above call for it, nor light shine upon it!",
  "5": "May darkness and gloom claim it, clouds settle upon it, the blackness of night affright it!",
  "6": "May obscurity seize that day; let it not occur among the days of the year, nor enter into the count of the months!",
  "7": "May that night be barren; let no joyful outcry greet it!",
  "8": "Let them curse it who curse the sea, the appointed disturbers of Leviathan!",
  "9": "May the stars of its twilight be darkened; may it look for daylight, but have none, nor gaze on the eyes of the dawn,",
  "10": "Because it kept not shut the doors of the womb to shield my eyes from trouble!",
  "11": "Why did I not perish at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?",
  "12": "Wherefore did the knees receive me? or why did I suck at the breasts?",
  "13": "For then I should have lain down and been tranquil; had I slept, I should then have been at rest",
  "14": "With kings and counselors of the earth who built where now there are ruins",
  "15": "Or with princes who had gold and filled their houses with silver.",
  "16": "Or why was I not buried away like an untimely birth, like babes that have never seen the light?",
  "17": "There the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "There the captives are at ease together, and hear not the voice of the slave driver.",
  "19": "Small and great are there the same, and the servant is free from his master.",
  "20": "Why is light given to the toilers, and life to the bitter in spirit?",
  "21": "They wait for death and it comes not; they search for it rather than for hidden treasures,",
  "22": "Rejoice in it exultingly, and are glad when they reach the grave:",
  "23": "Men whose path is hidden from them, and whom God has hemmed in!",
  "24": "For sighing comes more readily to me than food, and my groans well forth like water.",
  "25": "For what I fear overtakes me, and what I shrink from comes upon me.",
  "26": "I have no peace nor ease; I have no rest, for trouble comes!"
