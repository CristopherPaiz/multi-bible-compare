  "1": "I loathe my life. I will give myself up to complaint; I will speak from the bitterness of my soul.",
  "2": "I will say to God: Do not put me in the wrong! Let me know why you oppose me.",
  "3": "Is it a pleasure for you to oppress, to spurn the work of your hands, and smile on the plan of the wicked?",
  "4": "Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees?",
  "5": "Are your days as the days of a mortal, and are your years as a man's lifetime,",
  "6": "That you seek for guilt in me and search after my sins,",
  "7": "Even though you know that I am not wicked, and that none can deliver me out of your hand?",
  "8": "Your hands have formed me and fashioned me; will you then turn and destroy me?",
  "9": "Oh, remember that you fashioned me from clay! Will you then bring me down to dust again?",
  "10": "Did you not pour me out as milk, and thicken me like cheese?",
  "11": "With skin and flesh you clothed me, with bones and sinews knit me together.",
  "12": "Grace and favor you granted me, and your providence has preserved my spirit.",
  "13": "Yet these things you have hidden in your heart; I know that they are your purpose:",
  "14": "If I should sin, you would keep a watch against me, and from my guilt you would not absolve me.",
  "15": "If I should be wicked, alas for me! if righteous, I dare not hold up my head, filled with ignominy and sodden with affliction!",
  "16": "Should it lift up, you hunt me like a lion: repeatedly you show your wondrous power against me,",
  "17": "You renew your attack upon me and multiply your harassment of me; in waves your troops come against me.",
  "18": "Why then did you bring me forth from the womb? I should have died and no eye have seen me.",
  "19": "I should be as though I had never lived; I should have been taken from the womb to the grave.",
  "20": "Are not the days of my life few? Let me alone, that I may recover a little",
  "21": "Before I go whence I shall not return, to the land of darkness and of gloom,",
  "22": "The black, disordered land where darkness is the only light."
