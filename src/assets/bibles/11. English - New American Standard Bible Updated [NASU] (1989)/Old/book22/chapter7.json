  "1": "D Turn, turn, O Shulammite, turn, turn, that we may look at you! B Why would you look at the Shulammite as at the dance of the two companies?",
  "2": "D How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of an artist.",
  "3": "Your navel is a round bowl that should never lack for mixed wine. Your body is a heap of wheat encircled with lilies.",
  "4": "Your breasts are like twin fawns, the young of a gazelle.",
  "5": "Your neck is like a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower on Lebanon that looks toward Damascus.",
  "6": "You head rises like Carmel; your hair is like draperies of purple; a king is held captive in its tresses.",
  "7": "G How beautiful you are, how pleasing, my love, my delight!",
  "8": "Your very figure is like a palm tree, your breasts are like clusters.",
  "9": "I said: I will climb the palm tree, I will take hold of its branches. Now let your breasts be like clusters of the vine and the fragrance of your breath like apples,",
  "10": "And your mouth like an excellent wine- B that flows smoothly for my lover, spreading over the lips and the teeth.",
  "11": "I belong to my lover and for me he yearns.",
  "12": "Come, my lover, let us go forth to the fields and spend the night among the villages.",
  "13": "Let us go early to the vineyards, and see if the vines are in bloom, If the buds have opened, if the pomegranates have blossomed; There will I give you my love.",
  "14": "The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all choice fruits; Both fresh and mellowed fruits, my lover, I have kept in store for you."
