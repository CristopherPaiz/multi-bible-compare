  "1": "The Song of Songs by Solomon",
  "2": "B Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth! More delightful is your love than wine!",
  "3": "Your name spoken is a spreading perfume- that is why the maidens love you.",
  "4": "Draw me!- D We will follow you eagerly! B Bring me, O king, to your chambers. D With you we rejoice and exult, we extol your love; it is beyond wine: how rightly you are loved!",
  "5": "B I am as dark-- but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem- As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Salma.",
  "6": "Do not stare at me because I am swarthy, because the sun has burned me. My brothers have been angry with me; they charged me with the care of the vineyards: my own vineyard I have not cared for.",
  "7": "B Tell me, you whom my heart loves, where you pasture your flock, where you give them rest at midday, Lest I be found wandering after the flocks of your companions.",
  "8": "G If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, Follow the tracks of the flock and pasture the young ones near the shepherds' camps.",
  "9": "G To the steeds of Pharaoh's chariots would I liken you, my beloved:",
  "10": "Your cheeks lovely in pendants, your neck in jewels.",
  "11": "We will make pendants of gold for you, and silver ornaments.",
  "12": "B For the king's banquet my nard gives forth its fragrance.",
  "13": "My lover is for me a sachet of myrrh to rest in my bosom.",
  "14": "My lover is for me a cluster of henna from the vineyards of Engedi.",
  "15": "G Ah, you are beautiful, my beloved, ah, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves!",
  "16": "B Ah, you are beautiful, my lover-- yes, you are lovely. Our couch, too, is verdant;",
  "17": "the beams of our house are cedars, our rafters, cypresses."
