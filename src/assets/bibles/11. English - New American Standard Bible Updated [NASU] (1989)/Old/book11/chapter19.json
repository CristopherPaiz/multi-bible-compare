  "1": "Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done-- that he had put all the prophets to the sword.",
  "2": "Jezebel then sent a messenger to Elijah and said, \"May the gods do thus and so to me if by this time tomorrow I have not done with your life what was done to each of them.\"",
  "3": "Elijah was afraid and fled for his life, going to Beer-sheba of Judah. He left his servant there",
  "4": "and went a day's journey into the desert, until he came to a broom tree and sat beneath it. He prayed for death: \"This is enough, O LORD! Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.\"",
  "5": "He lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree, but then an angel touched him and ordered him to get up and eat.",
  "6": "He looked and there at his head was a hearth cake and a jug of water. After he ate and drank, he lay down again,",
  "7": "but the angel of the LORD came back a second time, touched him, and ordered, \"Get up and eat, else the journey will be too long for you!\"",
  "8": "He got up, ate and drank; then strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights to the mountain of God, Horeb.",
  "9": "There he came to a cave, where he took shelter. But the word of the LORD came to him, \"Why are you here, Elijah?\"",
  "10": "He answered: \"I have been most zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts, but the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to the sword. I alone am left, and they seek to take my life.\"",
  "11": "Then the LORD said, \"Go outside and stand on the mountain before the LORD; the LORD will be passing by.\" A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains and crushing rocks before the LORD-- but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake-- but the LORD was not in the earthquake.",
  "12": "After the earthquake there was fire-- but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound.",
  "13": "When he heard this, Elijah hid his face in his cloak and went and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, \"Elijah, why are you here?\"",
  "14": "He replied, \"I have been most zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. But the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to the sword. I alone am left, and they seek to take my life.\"",
  "15": "\"Go, take the road back to the desert near Damascus,\" the LORD said to him. \"When you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael as king of Aram.",
  "16": "Then you shall anoint Jehu, son of Nimshi, as king of Israel, and Elisha, son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, as prophet to succeed you.",
  "17": "If anyone escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill him. If he escapes the sword if Jehu, Elisha will kill him.",
  "18": "Yet I will leave seven thousand men in Israel-- all those who have not knelt to Baal or kissed him.\"",
  "19": "Elijah set out, and came upon Elisha, son of Shaphat, as he was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen; he was following the twelfth. Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak over him.",
  "20": "Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, \"Please, let me kiss my father and mother good-bye, and I will follow you.\" \"Go back!\" Elijah answered. \"Have I done anything to you?\"",
  "21": "Elisha left him and, taking the yoke of oxen, slaughtered them; he used the plowing equipment for fuel to boil their flesh, and gave it to his people to eat. Then he left and followed Elijah as his attendant."
