  "1": "(A:1) In the second year of the reign of the great King Ahasuerus, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream. (A:2) He was a Jew residing in the city of Susa, a prominent man who served at the king's court, (A:3) and one of the captives whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken from Jerusalem with Jeconiah, king of Judah. (A:4) This was his dream. There was noise and tumult, thunder and earthquake-confusion upon the earth. (A:5) Two great dragons came on, both poised for combat. They uttered a mighty cry, (A:6) and at their cry every nation prepared for war, to fight against the race of the just. (A:7) It was a dark and gloomy day. Tribulation and distress, evil and great confusion, lay upon the earth. (A:8) The whole race of the just were dismayed with fear of the evils to come upon them, and were at the point of destruction. (A:9) Then they cried out to God, and as they cried, there appeared to come forth a great river, a flood of water from a little spring. (A:10) The light of the sun broke forth; the lowly were exalted and they devoured the nobles. (A:11) Having seen this dream and what God intended to do, Mordecai awoke. He kept it in mind, and tried in every way, until night, to understand its meaning. (A:12) Mordecai lodged at the court with Bagathan and Thares, two eunuchs of the king who were court guards. (A:13) He overheard them plotting, investigated their plans, and discovered that they were preparing to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. So he informed the king about them, (A:14) and the king had the two eunuchs questioned and, upon their confession, put to death. (A:15) Then the king had these things recorded; Mordecai, too, put them into writing. (A:16) The king also appointed Mordecai to serve at the court, and rewarded him for his actions. (A:17) Haman, however, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who was in high honor with the king, sought to harm Mordecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king. During the reign of Ahasuerus-this was the Ahasuerus who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia-",
