(F:2) I recall the dream I had about these very things, and not a single detail has been left unfulfilled- (F:3) the tiny spring that grew into a river, the light of the sun, the many waters. The river is Esther, whom the king married and made queen. (F:4) The two dragons are myself and Haman. (F:5) The nations are those who assembled to destroy the name of the Jews, (F:6) but my people is Israel, who cried to God and was saved. \"The LORD saved his people and delivered us from all these evils. God worked signs and great wonders, such as have not occurred among the nations. (F:7) For this purpose he arranged two lots: one for the people of God, the second for all the other nations.
