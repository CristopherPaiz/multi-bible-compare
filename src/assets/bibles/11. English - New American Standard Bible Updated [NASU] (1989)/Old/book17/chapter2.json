  "7": "He was foster father to Hadassah, that is, Esther, his cousin; for she had lost both father and mother. The girl was beautifully formed and lovely to behold. On the death of her father and mother, Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter.",

  "16": "Esther was led to King Ahasuerus in his palace in the tenth month, Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.",
