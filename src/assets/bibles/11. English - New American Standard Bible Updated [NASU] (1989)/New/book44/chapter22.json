  "10": "I asked, 'What shall I do, sir?' The Lord answered me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything appointed for you to do.'",
  "11": "Since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light, I was led by hand by my companions and entered Damascus.",
  "12": "\"A certain Ananias, a devout observer of the law, and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,",

  "16": "Now, why delay? Get up and have yourself baptized and your sins washed away, calling upon his name.'",
  "17": "\"After I had returned to Jerusalem and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance",
  "18": "and saw the Lord saying to me, 'Hurry, leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'",
  "19": "But I replied, 'Lord, they themselves know that from synagogue to synagogue I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.",
  "20": "And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself stood by giving my approval and keeping guard over the cloaks of his murderers.'",
  "21": "Then he said to me, 'Go, I shall send you far away to the Gentiles.'\"",
