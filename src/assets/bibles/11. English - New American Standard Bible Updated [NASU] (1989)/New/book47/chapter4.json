  "1": "Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy shown us, we are not discouraged.",
  "2": "Rather, we have renounced shameful, hidden things; not acting deceitfully or falsifying the word of God, but by the open declaration of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.",
  "3": "And even though our gospel is veiled, it is veiled for those who are perishing,",

  "5": "For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for the sake of Jesus.",

  "16": "Therefore, we are not discouraged; rather, although our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.",
  "17": "For this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,",
  "18": "as we look not to what is seen but to what is unseen; for what is seen is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal."
