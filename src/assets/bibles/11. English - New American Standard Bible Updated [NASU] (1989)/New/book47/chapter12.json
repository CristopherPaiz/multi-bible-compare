  "3": "And I know that this person (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows)",
  "4": "was caught up into Paradise and heard ineffable things, which no one may utter.",
  "5": "About this person I will boast, but about myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.",
  "6": "Although if I should wish to boast, I would not be foolish, for I would be telling the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me",
  "7": "because of the abundance of the revelations. Therefore, that I might not become too elated, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.",
  "8": "Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me,",

  "15": "I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your sakes. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?",

  "17": "Did I take advantage of you through any of those I sent to you?",
  "18": "I urged Titus to go and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? And in the same steps?",

  "20": "For I fear that when I come I may find you not such as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish; that there may be rivalry, jealousy, fury, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.",
  "21": "I fear that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and licentiousness they practiced."
