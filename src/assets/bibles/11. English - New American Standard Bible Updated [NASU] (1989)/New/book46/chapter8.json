  "4": "So about the eating of meat sacrificed to idols: we know that \"there is no idol in the world,\" and that \"there is no God but one.\"",
  "5": "Indeed, even though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth (there are, to be sure, many \"gods\" and many \"lords\"),",
  "6": "yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all things are and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and through whom we exist.",

  "12": "When you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their consciences, weak as they are, you are sinning against Christ.",
