  "1": "Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.",
  "2": "You know how, when you were pagans, you were constantly attracted and led away to mute idols.",
  "3": "Therefore, I tell you that nobody speaking by the spirit of God says, \"Jesus be accursed.\" And no one can say, \"Jesus is Lord,\" except by the holy Spirit.",
  "4": "There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;",
  "5": "there are different forms of service but the same Lord;",
  "6": "there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone.",
  "7": "To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit.",
  "8": "To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;",
  "9": "to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;",
  "10": "to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues.",
  "11": "But one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing them individually to each person as he wishes.",
  "12": "As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ.",
  "13": "For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free persons, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.",
  "14": "Now the body is not a single part, but many.",
  "15": "If a foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand I do not belong to the body,\" it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.",
  "16": "Or if an ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye I do not belong to the body,\" it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.",
  "17": "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?",
  "18": "But as it is, God placed the parts, each one of them, in the body as he intended.",
  "19": "If they were all one part, where would the body be?",
  "20": "But as it is, there are many parts, yet one body.",
  "21": "The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I do not need you,\" nor again the head to the feet, \"I do not need you.\"",
  "22": "Indeed, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are all the more necessary,",
  "23": "and those parts of the body that we consider less honorable we surround with greater honor, and our less presentable parts are treated with greater propriety,",
  "24": "whereas our more presentable parts do not need this. But God has so constructed the body as to give greater honor to a part that is without it,",
  "25": "so that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have the same concern for one another.",
  "26": "If (one) part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if one part is honored, all the parts share its joy.",
  "27": "Now you are Christ's body, and individually parts of it.",
  "28": "Some people God has designated in the church to be, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then, mighty deeds; then, gifts of healing, assistance, administration, and varieties of tongues.",
  "29": "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work mighty deeds?",
  "30": "Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?",
  "31": "Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts. But I shall show you a still more excellent way."
