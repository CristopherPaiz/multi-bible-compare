  "1": "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.",
  "2": "And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "If I give away everything I own, and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing.",
  "4": "Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, (love) is not pompous, it is not inflated,",
  "5": "it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,",
  "6": "it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.",
  "7": "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never fails. If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.",
  "9": "For we know partially and we prophesy partially,",
  "10": "but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.",
  "11": "When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish things.",
  "12": "At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am fully known.",
  "13": "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
