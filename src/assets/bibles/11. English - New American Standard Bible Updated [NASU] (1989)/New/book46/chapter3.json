  "1": "Brothers, I could not talk to you as spiritual people, but as fleshly people, as infants in Christ.",
  "2": "I fed you milk, not solid food, because you were unable to take it. Indeed, you are still not able, even now,",
  "3": "for you are still of the flesh. While there is jealousy and rivalry among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving in an ordinary human way?",
  "4": "Whenever someone says, \"I belong to Paul,\" and another, \"I belong to Apollos,\" are you not merely human?",
  "5": "What is Apollos, after all, and what is Paul? Ministers through whom you became believers, just as the Lord assigned each one.",
  "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.",
  "7": "Therefore, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth.",
  "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters are equal, and each will receive wages in proportion to his labor.",
  "9": "For we are God's co-workers; you are God's field, God's building.",
  "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must be careful how he builds upon it,",
  "11": "for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that is there, namely, Jesus Christ.",
  "12": "If anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
  "13": "the work of each will come to light, for the Day will disclose it. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire (itself) will test the quality of each one's work.",
  "14": "If the work stands that someone built upon the foundation, that person will receive a wage.",
  "15": "But if someone's work is burned up, that one will suffer loss; the person will be saved, but only as through fire.",
  "16": "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
  "17": "If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy.",
  "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you considers himself wise in this age, let him become a fool so as to become wise.",
  "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the eyes of God, for it is written: \"He catches the wise in their own ruses,\"",
  "20": "and again: \"The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\"",
  "21": "So let no one boast about human beings, for everything belongs to you,",
  "22": "Paul or Apollos or Kephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future: all belong to you,",
  "23": "and you to Christ, and Christ to God."
