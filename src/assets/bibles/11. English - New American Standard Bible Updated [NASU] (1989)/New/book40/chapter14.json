  "12": "His disciples came and took away the corpse and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.",

  "14": "When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, and he cured their sick.",
  "15": "When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said, \"This is a deserted place and it is already late; dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.\"",

  "18": "Then he said, \"Bring them here to me,\"",

  "20": "They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments left over-- twelve wicker baskets full.",
  "21": "Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and children.",
  "22": "Then he made the disciples get into the boat and precede him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.",
  "23": "After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When it was evening he was there alone.",
