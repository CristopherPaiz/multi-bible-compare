  "1": "At that time the disciples approached Jesus and said, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\"",
  "2": "He called a child over, placed it in their midst,",
  "3": "and said, \"Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.",
  "4": "Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.",
  "5": "And whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me.",
  "6": "\"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.",
  "7": "Woe to the world because of things that cause sin! Such things must come, but woe to the one through whom they come!",
  "8": "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire.",
  "9": "And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into fiery Gehenna.",
  "10": "\"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.",
  "11": "()",
  "12": "What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray?",
  "13": "And if he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray.",
  "14": "In just the same way, it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.",
  "15": "\"If your brother sins (against you), go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won over your brother.",
  "16": "If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that 'every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.'",
  "17": "If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.",
  "18": "Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.",
  "19": "Again, (amen,) I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray, it shall be granted to them by my heavenly Father.",
  "20": "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"",
  "21": "Then Peter approaching asked him, \"Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive him? As many as seven times?\"",
  "22": "Jesus answered, \"I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.",
  "23": "That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.",
  "24": "When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.",
  "25": "Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.",
  "26": "At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'",
  "27": "Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.",
  "28": "When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount. He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, 'Pay back what you owe.'",
  "29": "Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'",
  "30": "But he refused. Instead, he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt.",
  "31": "Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.",
  "32": "His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.",
  "33": "Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'",
  "34": "Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.",
  "35": "So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\""
