  "1": "I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Of course not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?",
  "3": "\"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.\"",
  "4": "But what is God's response to him? \"I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal.\"",
  "5": "So also at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.",
  "6": "But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.",
  "7": "What then? What Israel was seeking it did not attain, but the elect attained it; the rest were hardened,",
  "8": "as it is written: \"God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day.\"",
  "9": "And David says: \"Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;",
  "10": "let their eyes grow dim so that they may not see, and keep their backs bent forever.\"",
  "11": "Hence I ask, did they stumble so as to fall? Of course not! But through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make them jealous.",
  "12": "Now if their transgression is enrichment for the world, and if their diminished number is enrichment for the Gentiles, how much more their full number.",
  "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry",
  "14": "in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them.",
  "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?",
  "16": "If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.",
  "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place and have come to share in the rich root of the olive tree,",
  "18": "do not boast against the branches. If you do boast, consider that you do not support the root; the root supports you.",
  "19": "Indeed you will say, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\"",
  "20": "That is so. They were broken off because of unbelief, but you are there because of faith. So do not become haughty, but stand in awe.",
  "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, (perhaps) he will not spare you either.",
  "22": "See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness to you, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.",
  "23": "And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",
  "24": "For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated one, how much more will they who belong to it by nature be grafted back into their own olive tree.",
  "25": "I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not become wise (in) your own estimation: a hardening has come upon Israel in part, until the full number of the Gentiles comes in,",
  "26": "and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come out of Zion, he will turn away godlessness from Jacob;",
  "27": "and this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\"",
  "28": "In respect to the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but in respect to election, they are beloved because of the patriarchs.",
  "29": "For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.",
  "30": "Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,",
  "31": "so they have now disobeyed in order that, by virtue of the mercy shown to you, they too may (now) receive mercy.",
  "32": "For God delivered all to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.",
  "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!",
  "34": "\"For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor?\"",
  "35": "\"Or who has given him anything that he may be repaid?\"",
  "36": "For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."
