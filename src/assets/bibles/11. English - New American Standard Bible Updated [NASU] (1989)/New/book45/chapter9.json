  "6": "But it is not that the word of God has failed. For not all who are of Israel are Israel,",
  "7": "nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but \"It is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name.\"",
  "8": "This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.",
  "9": "For this is the wording of the promise, \"About this time I shall return and Sarah will have a son.\"",
  "10": "And not only that, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one husband, our father Isaac--",

  "14": "What then are we to say? Is there injustice on the part of God? Of course not!",
  "15": "For he says to Moses: \"I will show mercy to whom I will, I will take pity on whom I will.\"",
  "16": "So it depends not upon a person's will or exertion, but upon God, who shows mercy.",
  "17": "For the scripture says to Pharaoh, \"This is why I have raised you up, to show my power through you that my name may be proclaimed throughout the earth.\"",
  "18": "Consequently, he has mercy upon whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills.",
  "19": "You will say to me then, \"Why (then) does he still find fault? For who can oppose his will?\"",
