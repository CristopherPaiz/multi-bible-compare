  "1": "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God on their behalf is for salvation.",
  "2": "I testify with regard to them that they have zeal for God, but it is not discerning.",
  "3": "For, in their unawareness of the righteousness that comes from God and their attempt to establish their own (righteousness), they did not submit to the righteousness of God.",
  "4": "For Christ is the end of the law for the justification of everyone who has faith.",
  "5": "Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from (the) law, \"The one who does these things will live by them.\"",
  "6": "But the righteousness that comes from faith says, \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will go up into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down)",
  "7": "or 'Who will go down into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\"",
  "8": "But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\" (that is, the word of faith that we preach),",
  "9": "for, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.",

  "16": "But not everyone has heeded the good news; for Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed what was heard from us?\"",
  "17": "Thus faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.",
  "18": "But I ask, did they not hear? Certainly they did; for \"Their voice has gone forth to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\"",
  "19": "But I ask, did not Israel understand? First Moses says: \"I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation I will make you angry.\"",
  "20": "Then Isaiah speaks boldly and says: \"I was found (by) those who were not seeking me; I revealed myself to those who were not asking for me.\"",
  "21": "But regarding Israel he says, \"All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contentious people.\""
