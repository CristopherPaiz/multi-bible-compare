  "1": "Paul, an apostle not from human beings nor through a human being but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,",
  "2": "and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:",
  "3": "grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "4": "who gave himself for our sins that he might rescue us from the present evil age in accord with the will of our God and Father,",
  "5": "to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.",
  "6": "I am amazed that you are so quickly forsaking the one who called you by (the) grace (of Christ) for a different gospel",
  "7": "(not that there is another). But there are some who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.",
  "8": "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach (to you) a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be accursed!",
  "9": "As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be accursed!",
  "10": "Am I now currying favor with human beings or God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.",
  "11": "Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin.",
  "12": "For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.",
  "13": "For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it,",
  "14": "and progressed in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my race, since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral traditions.",
  "15": "But when (God), who from my mother's womb had set me apart and called me through his grace, was pleased",
  "16": "to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him to the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult flesh and blood,",
  "17": "nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; rather, I went into Arabia and then returned to Damascus.",
  "18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to confer with Kephas and remained with him for fifteen days.",
  "19": "But I did not see any other of the apostles, only James the brother of the Lord.",
  "20": "(As to what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.)",
  "21": "Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
  "22": "And I was unknown personally to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;",
  "23": "they only kept hearing that \"the one who once was persecuting us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.\"",
  "24": "So they glorified God because of me."
