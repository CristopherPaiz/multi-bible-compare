  "1": "James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion, greetings.",
  "2": "Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials,",
  "3": "for you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.",
  "4": "And let perseverance be perfect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.",
  "5": "But if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and he will be given it.",
  "6": "But he should ask in faith, not doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind.",
  "7": "For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord,",
  "8": "since he is a man of two minds, unstable in all his ways.",
  "9": "The brother in lowly circumstances should take pride in his high standing,",
  "10": "and the rich one in his lowliness, for he will pass away \"like the flower of the field.\"",
  "11": "For the sun comes up with its scorching heat and dries up the grass, its flower droops, and the beauty of its appearance vanishes. So will the rich person fade away in the midst of his pursuits.",
  "12": "Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation, for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life that he promised to those who love him.",
  "13": "No one experiencing temptation should say, \"I am being tempted by God\"; for God is not subject to temptation to evil, and he himself tempts no one.",
  "14": "Rather, each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.",
  "15": "Then desire conceives and brings forth sin, and when sin reaches maturity it gives birth to death.",
  "16": "Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers:",
  "17": "all good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no alteration or shadow caused by change.",
  "18": "He willed to give us birth by the word of truth that we may be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.",
  "19": "Know this, my dear brothers: everyone should be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath,",
  "20": "for the wrath of a man does not accomplish the righteousness of God.",
  "21": "Therefore, put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the word that has been planted in you and is able to save your souls.",
  "22": "Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.",
  "23": "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his own face in a mirror.",
  "24": "He sees himself, then goes off and promptly forgets what he looked like.",
  "25": "But the one who peers into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres, and is not a hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, such a one shall be blessed in what he does.",
  "26": "If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, his religion is vain.",
  "27": "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
