  "1": "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,",
  "2": "for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also.",
  "3": "If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.",
  "4": "It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot's inclination wishes.",
  "5": "In the same way the tongue is a small member and yet has great pretensions. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.",
  "6": "The tongue is also a fire. It exists among our members as a world of malice, defiling the whole body and setting the entire course of our lives on fire, itself set on fire by Gehenna.",
  "7": "For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,",
  "8": "but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.",
  "9": "With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings who are made in the likeness of God.",

  "14": "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.",
  "15": "Wisdom of this kind does not come down from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.",
  "16": "For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every foul practice.",
  "17": "But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without inconstancy or insincerity.",
  "18": "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who cultivate peace."
