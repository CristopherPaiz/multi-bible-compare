  "1": "\"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.",
  "2": "He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and everyone that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.",
  "3": "You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.",
  "4": "Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.",
  "5": "I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing.",
  "6": "Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither; people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned.",
  "7": "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.",
  "8": "By this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.",
  "9": "As the Father loves me, so I also love you. Remain in my love.",
  "10": "If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love.",
  "11": "\"I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.",
  "12": "This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.",
  "13": "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.",
  "14": "You are my friends if you do what I command you.",
  "15": "I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.",
  "16": "It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.",
  "17": "This I command you: love one another.",
  "18": "\"If the world hates you, realize that it hated me first.",
  "19": "If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.",
  "20": "Remember the word I spoke to you, 'No slave is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.",
  "21": "And they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.",
  "22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but as it is they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "Whoever hates me also hates my Father.",
  "24": "If I had not done works among them that no one else ever did, they would not have sin; but as it is, they have seen and hated both me and my Father.",
  "25": "But in order that the word written in their law might be fulfilled, 'They hated me without cause.'",
  "26": "\"When the Advocate comes whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father, he will testify to me.",
  "27": "And you also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning."
