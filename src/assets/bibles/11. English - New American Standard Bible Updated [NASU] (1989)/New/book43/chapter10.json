  "1": "\"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber.",
  "2": "But whoever enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.",
  "3": "The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice, as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
  "4": "When he has driven out all his own, he walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they recognize his voice.",
  "5": "But they will not follow a stranger; they will run away from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.\"",
  "6": "Although Jesus used this figure of speech, they did not realize what he was trying to tell them.",
  "7": "So Jesus said again, \"Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep.",
  "8": "All who came (before me) are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.",
  "9": "I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.",
  "10": "A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly.",
  "11": "I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
  "12": "A hired man, who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own, sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away, and the wolf catches and scatters them.",
  "13": "This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.",
  "14": "I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me,",
  "15": "just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep.",
  "16": "I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.",
  "17": "This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.",
  "18": "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again. This command I have received from my Father.\"",
  "19": "Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.",
  "20": "Many of them said, \"He is possessed and out of his mind; why listen to him?\"",
  "21": "Others said, \"These are not the words of one possessed; surely a demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?\"",
  "22": "The feast of the Dedication was then taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter.",
  "23": "And Jesus walked about in the temple area on the Portico of Solomon.",
  "24": "So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, \"How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\"",
  "25": "Jesus answered them, \"I told you and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify to me.",
  "26": "But you do not believe, because you are not among my sheep.",
  "27": "My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me.",
  "28": "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can take them out of my hand.",
  "29": "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can take them out of the Father's hand.",
  "30": "The Father and I are one.\"",
  "31": "The Jews again picked up rocks to stone him.",
  "32": "Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of these are you trying to stone me?\"",
  "33": "The Jews answered him, \"We are not stoning you for a good work but for blasphemy. You, a man, are making yourself God.\"",
  "34": "Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, \"You are gods\"'?",
  "35": "If it calls them gods to whom the word of God came, and scripture cannot be set aside,",
  "36": "can you say that the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world blasphemes because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?",
  "37": "If I do not perform my Father's works, do not believe me;",
  "38": "but if I perform them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may realize (and understand) that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\"",
  "39": "(Then) they tried again to arrest him; but he escaped from their power.",
  "40": "He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first baptized, and there he remained.",
  "41": "Many came to him and said, \"John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true.\"",
  "42": "And many there began to believe in him."
