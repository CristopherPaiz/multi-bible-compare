  "15": "Jesus said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\" She thought it was the gardener and said to him, \"Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him.\"",
  "16": "Jesus said to her, \"Mary!\" She turned and said to him in Hebrew, \"Rabbouni,\" which means Teacher.",
  "17": "Jesus said to her, \"Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'\"",

  "19": "On the evening of that first day of the week, when the doors were locked, where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\"",

  "21": "(Jesus) said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.\"",
  "22": "And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, \"Receive the holy Spirit.",

  "29": "Jesus said to him, \"Have you come to believe because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.\"",
  "30": "Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of (his) disciples that are not written in this book.",
