  "6": "But because I told you this, grief has filled your hearts.",
  "7": "But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.",
  "8": "And when he comes he will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation:",
  "9": "sin, because they do not believe in me;",
  "10": "righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me;",
  "11": "condemnation, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.",

  "18": "So they said, \"What is this 'little while' (of which he speaks)? We do not know what he means.\"",
  "19": "Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, \"Are you discussing with one another what I said, 'A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me'?",
  "20": "Amen, amen, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, while the world rejoices; you will grieve, but your grief will become joy.",
  "21": "When a woman is in labor, she is in anguish because her hour has arrived; but when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into the world.",
