  "6": "For it says in scripture: \"Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion, a cornerstone, chosen and precious, and whoever believes in it shall not be put to shame.\"",
  "7": "Therefore, its value is for you who have faith, but for those without faith: \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,\"",

  "21": "For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps.",
  "22": "\"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\"",
  "23": "When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly.",
