  "4": "but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God.",
  "5": "For this is also how the holy women who hoped in God once used to adorn themselves and were subordinate to their husbands;",
  "6": "thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him \"lord.\" You are her children when you do what is good and fear no intimidation.",
