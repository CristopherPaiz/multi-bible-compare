  "4": "Or those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them-- do you think they were more guilty than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem?",
  "5": "By no means! But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did!\"",
  "6": "And he told them this parable: \"There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard, and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none,",
  "7": "he said to the gardener, 'For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none. (So) cut it down. Why should it exhaust the soil?'",

  "19": "It is like a mustard seed that a person took and planted in the garden. When it was fully grown, it became a large bush and 'the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches.'\"",
  "20": "Again he said, \"To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?",
  "21": "It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed (in) with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was leavened.\"",
