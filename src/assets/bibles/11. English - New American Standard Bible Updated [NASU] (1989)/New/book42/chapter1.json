  "3": "I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,",
  "4": "so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received.",
  "5": "In the days of Herod, King of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah; his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.",
  "6": "Both were righteous in the eyes of God, observing all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.",

  "12": "Zechariah was troubled by what he saw, and fear came upon him.",
  "13": "But the angel said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John.",
  "14": "And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,",

  "16": "and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.",
  "17": "He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of fathers toward children and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people fit for the Lord.\"",
  "18": "Then Zechariah said to the angel, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\"",
  "19": "And the angel said to him in reply, \"I am Gabriel, who stand before God. I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.",
  "20": "But now you will be speechless and unable to talk until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.\"",
  "21": "Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.",
  "22": "But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was gesturing to them but remained mute.",
  "23": "Then, when his days of ministry were completed, he went home.",
  "24": "After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she went into seclusion for five months, saying,",
  "25": "\"So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.\"",

  "31": "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.",
  "32": "He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,",
  "33": "and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"",
  "34": "But Mary said to the angel, \"How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?\"",
  "35": "And the angel said to her in reply, \"The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.",
  "36": "And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;",
  "37": "for nothing will be impossible for God.\"",
  "38": "Mary said, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.\" Then the angel departed from her.",
  "39": "During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah,",
  "40": "where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.",
  "41": "When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit,",

  "49": "The Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.",
  "50": "His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him.",
  "51": "He has shown might with his arm, dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.",
  "52": "He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones but lifted up the lowly.",
  "53": "The hungry he has filled with good things; the rich he has sent away empty.",
  "54": "He has helped Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,",
  "55": "according to his promise to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.\"",
  "56": "Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.",
  "57": "When the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son.",
  "58": "Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.",
  "59": "When they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father,",
  "60": "but his mother said in reply, \"No. He will be called John.\"",
  "61": "But they answered her, \"There is no one among your relatives who has this name.\"",
  "62": "So they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called.",
