  "1": "Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.",
  "2": "They brought charges against him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.\"",
  "3": "Pilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"",
  "4": "Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find this man not guilty.\"",
  "5": "But they were adamant and said, \"He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.\"",
  "6": "On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;",
  "7": "and upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.",
  "8": "Herod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.",
  "9": "He questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer.",
  "10": "The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly.",
  "11": "(Even) Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate.",
  "12": "Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly.",
  "13": "Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people",
  "14": "and said to them, \"You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him,",
  "15": "nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him.",
  "16": "Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"",
  "17": "",
  "18": "But all together they shouted out, \"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.\"",
  "19": "(Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.)",
  "20": "Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,",
  "21": "but they continued their shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\"",
  "22": "Pilate addressed them a third time, \"What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"",
  "23": "With loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed.",
  "24": "The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.",
  "25": "So he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.",
  "26": "As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus.",
  "27": "A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him.",
  "28": "Jesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children,",
  "29": "for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.'",
  "30": "At that time people will say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'",
  "31": "for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\"",
  "32": "Now two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.",
  "33": "When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.",
  "34": "(Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\") They divided his garments by casting lots.",
  "35": "The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, \"He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.\"",
  "36": "Even the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine",
  "37": "they called out, \"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.\"",
  "38": "Above him there was an inscription that read, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"",
  "39": "Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\"",
  "40": "The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, \"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation?",
  "41": "And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\"",
  "42": "Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"",
  "43": "He replied to him, \"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"",
  "44": "It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon",
  "45": "because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.",
  "46": "Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last.",
  "47": "The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, \"This man was innocent beyond doubt.\"",
  "48": "When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts;",
  "49": "but all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.",
  "50": "Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council,",
  "51": "had not consented to their plan of action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God.",
  "52": "He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.",
  "53": "After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried.",
  "54": "It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin.",
  "55": "The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it,",
  "56": "they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils. Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment."
