  "1": "The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to him,",
  "2": "but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying, \"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.\"",
  "3": "So to them he addressed this parable.",
  "4": "\"What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it?",
  "5": "And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy",
  "6": "and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.'",
  "7": "I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.",
  "8": "\"Or what woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully until she finds it?",
  "9": "And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.'",
  "10": "In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"",
  "11": "Then he said, \"A man had two sons,",
  "12": "and the younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.' So the father divided the property between them.",
  "13": "After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.",
  "14": "When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need.",
  "15": "So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.",
  "16": "And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any.",
  "17": "Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I, dying from hunger.",
  "18": "I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.",
  "19": "I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.\"'",
  "20": "So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.",
  "21": "His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.'",
  "22": "But his father ordered his servants, 'Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.",
  "23": "Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast,",
  "24": "because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.' Then the celebration began.",
  "25": "Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing.",
  "26": "He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.",
  "27": "The servant said to him, 'Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'",
  "28": "He became angry, and when he refused to enter the house, his father came out and pleaded with him.",
  "29": "He said to his father in reply, 'Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.",
  "30": "But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'",
  "31": "He said to him, 'My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours.",
  "32": "But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.'\""
