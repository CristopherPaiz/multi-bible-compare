  "1": "Now the feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was drawing near,",
  "2": "and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to put him to death, for they were afraid of the people.",
  "3": "Then Satan entered into Judas, the one surnamed Iscariot, who was counted among the Twelve,",
  "4": "and he went to the chief priests and temple guards to discuss a plan for handing him over to them.",
  "5": "They were pleased and agreed to pay him money.",
  "6": "He accepted their offer and sought a favorable opportunity to hand him over to them in the absence of a crowd.",
  "7": "When the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread arrived, the day for sacrificing the Passover lamb,",
  "8": "he sent out Peter and John, instructing them, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\"",
  "9": "They asked him, \"Where do you want us to make the preparations?\"",
  "10": "And he answered them, \"When you go into the city, a man will meet you carrying a jar of water. Follow him into the house that he enters",
  "11": "and say to the master of the house, 'The teacher says to you, \"Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\"'",
  "12": "He will show you a large upper room that is furnished. Make the preparations there.\"",
  "13": "Then they went off and found everything exactly as he had told them, and there they prepared the Passover.",
  "14": "When the hour came, he took his place at table with the apostles.",
  "15": "He said to them, \"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,",
  "16": "for, I tell you, I shall not eat it (again) until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\"",
  "17": "Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, \"Take this and share it among yourselves;",
  "18": "for I tell you (that) from this time on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\"",
  "19": "Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me.\"",
  "20": "And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you.",
  "21": "\"And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me is with me on the table;",
  "22": "for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.\"",
  "23": "And they began to debate among themselves who among them would do such a deed.",
  "24": "Then an argument broke out among them about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.",
  "25": "He said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors';",
  "26": "but among you it shall not be so. Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.",
  "27": "For who is greater: the one seated at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one seated at table? I am among you as the one who serves.",
  "28": "It is you who have stood by me in my trials;",
  "29": "and I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one on me,",
  "30": "that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
  "31": "\"Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,",
  "32": "but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.\"",
  "33": "He said to him, \"Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.\"",
  "34": "But he replied, \"I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.\"",
  "35": "He said to them, \"When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?\" \"No, nothing,\" they replied.",
  "36": "He said to them, \"But now one who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.",
  "37": "For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, namely, 'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.\"",
  "38": "Then they said, \"Lord, look, there are two swords here.\" But he replied, \"It is enough!\"",
  "39": "Then going out he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.",
  "40": "When he arrived at the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not undergo the test.\"",
  "41": "After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he prayed,",
  "42": "saying, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.\"",
  "43": "(And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.",
  "44": "He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.)",
  "45": "When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.",
  "46": "He said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\"",
  "47": "While he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him.",
  "48": "Jesus said to him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"",
  "49": "His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked, \"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?\"",
  "50": "And one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.",
  "51": "But Jesus said in reply, \"Stop, no more of this!\" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.",
  "52": "And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders who had come for him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?",
  "53": "Day after day I was with you in the temple area, and you did not seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.\"",
  "54": "After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.",
  "55": "They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.",
  "56": "When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, \"This man too was with him.\"",
  "57": "But he denied it saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\"",
  "58": "A short while later someone else saw him and said, \"You too are one of them\"; but Peter answered, \"My friend, I am not.\"",
  "59": "About an hour later, still another insisted, \"Assuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.\"",
  "60": "But Peter said, \"My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.\" Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,",
  "61": "and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\"",
  "62": "He went out and began to weep bitterly.",
  "63": "The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.",
  "64": "They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\"",
  "65": "And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.",
  "66": "When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.",
  "67": "They said, \"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\" but he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe,",
  "68": "and if I question, you will not respond.",
  "69": "But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\"",
  "70": "They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied to them, \"You say that I am.\"",
  "71": "Then they said, \"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\""
