  "6": "through these the world that then existed was destroyed, deluged with water.",
  "7": "The present heavens and earth have been reserved by the same word for fire, kept for the day of judgment and of destruction of the godless.",

  "17": "Therefore, beloved, since you are forewarned, be on your guard not to be led into the error of the unprincipled and to fall from your own stability.",
  "18": "But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and to the day of eternity. (Amen.)"
