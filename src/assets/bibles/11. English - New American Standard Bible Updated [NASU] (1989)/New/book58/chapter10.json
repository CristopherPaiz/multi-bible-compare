  "8": "First he says, \"Sacrifices and offerings, holocausts and sin offerings, you neither desired nor delighted in.\" These are offered according to the law.",
  "9": "Then he says, \"Behold, I come to do your will.\" He takes away the first to establish the second.",
  "10": "By this \"will,\" we have been consecrated through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.",
  "11": "Every priest stands daily at his ministry, offering frequently those same sacrifices that can never take away sins.",
  "12": "But this one offered one sacrifice for sins, and took his seat forever at the right hand of God;",
  "13": "now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool.",
  "14": "For by one offering he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated.",
  "15": "The holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying:",
  "16": "\"This is the covenant I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord: 'I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them upon their minds,'\"",
  "17": "he also says: \"Their sins and their evildoing I will remember no more.\"",
  "18": "Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer offering for sin.",
  "19": "Therefore, brothers, since through the blood of Jesus we have confidence of entrance into the sanctuary",
  "20": "by the new and living way he opened for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,",
  "21": "and since we have \"a great priest over the house of God,\"",
  "22": "let us approach with a sincere heart and in absolute trust, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.",
  "23": "Let us hold unwaveringly to our confession that gives us hope, for he who made the promise is trustworthy.",
  "24": "We must consider how to rouse one another to love and good works.",
  "25": "We should not stay away from our assembly, as is the custom of some, but encourage one another, and this all the more as you see the day drawing near.",

  "29": "Do you not think that a much worse punishment is due the one who has contempt for the Son of God, considers unclean the covenant-blood by which he was consecrated, and insults the spirit of grace?",
