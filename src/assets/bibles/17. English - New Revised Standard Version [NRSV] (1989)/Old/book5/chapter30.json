  "17": "But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to bow down to other gods and serve them,",
  "18": "I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.",
  "19": "I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live,",
  "20": "loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the LORD swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
