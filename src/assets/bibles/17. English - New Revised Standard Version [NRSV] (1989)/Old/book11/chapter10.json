  "3": "Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.",

  "5": "the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his valets, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.",
  "6": "So she said to the king, \"The report was true that I heard in my own land of your accomplishments and of your wisdom,",
  "7": "but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. Not even half had been told me; your wisdom and prosperity far surpass the report that I had heard.",
  "8": "Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend you and hear your wisdom!",
  "9": "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king to execute justice and righteousness.\"",

  "12": "From the almug wood the king made supports for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.",
  "13": "Meanwhile King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desire that she expressed, as well as what he gave her out of Solomon's royal bounty. Then she returned to her own land, with her servants.",
  "14": "The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,",
  "15": "besides that which came from the traders and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land.",
  "16": "King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each large shield.",
  "17": "He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.",
  "18": "The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold.",
  "19": "The throne had six steps. The top of the throne was rounded in the back, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,",
  "20": "while twelve lions were standing, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made in any kingdom.",
  "21": "All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver-- it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.",

  "27": "The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as numerous as the sycamores of the Shephelah.",
  "28": "Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price.",
  "29": "A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram."
