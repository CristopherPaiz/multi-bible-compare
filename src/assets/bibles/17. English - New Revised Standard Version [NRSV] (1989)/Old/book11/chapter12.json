  "9": "He said to them, \"What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?\"",
  "10": "The young men who had grown up with him said to him, \"Thus you should say to this people who spoke to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must lighten it for us'; thus you should say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.",
  "11": "Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'\"",
