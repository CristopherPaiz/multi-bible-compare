  "3": "Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?",
  "4": "Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts,",
  "5": "according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.",

  "13": "Then Haggai said, \"If one who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?\" The priests answered, \"Yes, it becomes unclean.\"",
  "14": "Haggai then said, So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, says the LORD; and so with every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.",

  "17": "I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and mildew and hail; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.",
  "18": "Consider from this day on, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider:",
