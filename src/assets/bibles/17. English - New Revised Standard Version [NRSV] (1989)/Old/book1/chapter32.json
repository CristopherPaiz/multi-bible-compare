  "1": "Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him;",
  "2": "and when Jacob saw them he said, \"This is God's camp!\" So he called that place Mahanaim.",
  "3": "Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,",
  "4": "instructing them, \"Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have lived with Laban as an alien, and stayed until now;",
  "5": "and I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'\"",
  "6": "The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \"We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.\"",
  "7": "Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies,",
  "8": "thinking, \"If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company that is left will escape.\"",
  "9": "And Jacob said, \"O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will do you good,'",
  "10": "I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.",
  "11": "Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him; he may come and kill us all, the mothers with the children.",
  "12": "Yet you have said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted because of their number.'\"",
  "13": "So he spent that night there, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,",
  "14": "two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,",
  "15": "thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.",
  "16": "These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, \"Pass on ahead of me, and put a space between drove and drove.\"",
  "17": "He instructed the foremost, \"When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'",
  "18": "then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.'\"",
  "19": "He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, \"You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him,",
  "20": "and you shall say, 'Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.'\" For he thought, \"I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me.\"",
  "21": "So the present passed on ahead of him; and he himself spent that night in the camp.",
  "22": "The same night he got up and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.",
  "23": "He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had.",
  "24": "Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.",
  "25": "When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he struck him on the hip socket; and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.",
  "26": "Then he said, \"Let me go, for the day is breaking.\" But Jacob said, \"I will not let you go, unless you bless me.\"",
  "27": "So he said to him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Jacob.\"",
  "28": "Then the man said, \"You shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with humans, and have prevailed.\"",
  "29": "Then Jacob asked him, \"Please tell me your name.\" But he said, \"Why is it that you ask my name?\" And there he blessed him.",
  "30": "So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, \"For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved.\"",
  "31": "The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.",
  "32": "Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the hip socket, because he struck Jacob on the hip socket at the thigh muscle."
