  "10": "And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.",
  "11": "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.",
  "12": "The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.",
  "13": "On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,",

  "15": "They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.",
  "16": "And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.",
  "17": "The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.",
  "18": "The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.",

  "21": "And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;",
  "22": "everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.",
  "23": "He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.",
  "24": "And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days."
