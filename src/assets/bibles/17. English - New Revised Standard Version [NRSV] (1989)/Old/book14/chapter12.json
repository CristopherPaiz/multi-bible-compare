  "4": "He took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.",
  "5": "Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the officers of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, \"Thus says the LORD: You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.\"",
  "6": "Then the officers of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, \"The LORD is in the right.\"",
  "7": "When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying: \"They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.",
