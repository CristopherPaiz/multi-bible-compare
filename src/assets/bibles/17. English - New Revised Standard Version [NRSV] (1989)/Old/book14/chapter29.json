  "1": "Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.",
  "2": "He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his ancestor David had done.",
  "3": "In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.",
  "4": "He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east.",
  "5": "He said to them, \"Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and carry out the filth from the holy place.",
  "6": "For our ancestors have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God; they have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the dwelling of the LORD, and turned their backs.",
  "7": "They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps, and have not offered incense or made burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.",
  "8": "Therefore the wrath of the LORD came upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.",
  "9": "Our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.",
  "10": "Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger may turn away from us.",
  "11": "My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence to minister to him, and to be his ministers and make offerings to him.\"",
  "12": "Then the Levites arose, Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;",
  "13": "and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;",
  "14": "and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.",
  "15": "They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.",
  "16": "The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the unclean things that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD; and the Levites took them and carried them out to the Wadi Kidron.",
  "17": "They began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD; then for eight days they sanctified the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.",
  "18": "Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, \"We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils.",
  "19": "All the utensils that King Ahaz repudiated during his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and sanctified; see, they are in front of the altar of the LORD.\"",
  "20": "Then King Hezekiah rose early, assembled the officials of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.",
  "21": "They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded the priests the descendants of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.",
  "22": "So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and dashed it against the altar; they slaughtered the rams and their blood was dashed against the altar; they also slaughtered the lambs and their blood was dashed against the altar.",
  "23": "Then the male goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly; they laid their hands on them,",
  "24": "and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood at the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.",
  "25": "He stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king's seer and of the prophet Nathan, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets.",
  "26": "The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.",
  "27": "Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of King David of Israel.",
  "28": "The whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.",
  "29": "When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.",
  "30": "King Hezekiah and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of the seer Asaph. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.",
  "31": "Then Hezekiah said, \"You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD; come near, bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.\" The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings; and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.",
  "32": "The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.",
  "33": "The consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.",
  "34": "But the priests were too few and could not skin all the burnt offerings, so, until other priests had sanctified themselves, their kindred, the Levites, helped them until the work was finished-- for the Levites were more conscientious than the priests in sanctifying themselves.",
  "35": "Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of the offerings of well-being, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored.",
  "36": "And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for the people; for the thing had come about suddenly."
