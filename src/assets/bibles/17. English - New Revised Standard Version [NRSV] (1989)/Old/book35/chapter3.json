  "1": "A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk according to Shigionoth.",
  "2": "O LORD, I have heard of your renown, and I stand in awe, O LORD, of your work. In our own time revive it; in our own time make it known; in wrath may you remember mercy.",
  "3": "God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.",
  "4": "The brightness was like the sun; rays came forth from his hand, where his power lay hidden.",
  "5": "Before him went pestilence, and plague followed close behind.",
  "6": "He stopped and shook the earth; he looked and made the nations tremble. The eternal mountains were shattered; along his ancient pathways the everlasting hills sank low.",
  "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction; the tent-curtains of the land of Midian trembled.",
  "8": "Was your wrath against the rivers, O LORD? Or your anger against the rivers, or your rage against the sea, when you drove your horses, your chariots to victory?",
  "9": "You brandished your naked bow, sated were the arrows at your command. Selah You split the earth with rivers.",
  "10": "The mountains saw you, and writhed; a torrent of water swept by; the deep gave forth its voice. The sun raised high its hands;",
  "11": "the moon stood still in its exalted place, at the light of your arrows speeding by, at the gleam of your flashing spear.",
  "12": "In fury you trod the earth, in anger you trampled nations.",
  "13": "You came forth to save your people, to save your anointed. You crushed the head of the wicked house, laying it bare from foundation to roof. Selah",
  "14": "You pierced with their own arrows the head of his warriors, who came like a whirlwind to scatter us, gloating as if ready to devour the poor who were in hiding.",
  "15": "You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the mighty waters.",
  "16": "I hear, and I tremble within; my lips quiver at the sound. Rottenness enters into my bones, and my steps tremble beneath me. I wait quietly for the day of calamity to come upon the people who attack us.",
  "17": "Though the fig tree does not blossom, and no fruit is on the vines; though the produce of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food; though the flock is cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls,",
  "18": "yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will exult in the God of my salvation.",
  "19": "GOD, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, and makes me tread upon the heights. To the leader: with stringed instruments."
