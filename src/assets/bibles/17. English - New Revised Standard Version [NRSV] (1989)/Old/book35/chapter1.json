  "1": "The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw.",
  "2": "O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Or cry to you \"Violence!\" and you will not save?",
  "3": "Why do you make me see wrongdoing and look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.",
  "4": "So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails. The wicked surround the righteous-- therefore judgment comes forth perverted.",
  "5": "Look at the nations, and see! Be astonished! Be astounded! For a work is being done in your days that you would not believe if you were told.",
  "6": "For I am rousing the Chaldeans, that fierce and impetuous nation, who march through the breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own.",
  "7": "Dread and fearsome are they; their justice and dignity proceed from themselves.",
  "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards, more menacing than wolves at dusk; their horses charge. Their horsemen come from far away; they fly like an eagle swift to devour.",
  "9": "They all come for violence, with faces pressing forward; they gather captives like sand.",
  "10": "At kings they scoff, and of rulers they make sport. They laugh at every fortress, and heap up earth to take it.",
  "11": "Then they sweep by like the wind; they transgress and become guilty; their own might is their god!",
  "12": "Are you not from of old, O LORD my God, my Holy One? You shall not die. O LORD, you have marked them for judgment; and you, O Rock, have established them for punishment.",
  "13": "Your eyes are too pure to behold evil, and you cannot look on wrongdoing; why do you look on the treacherous, and are silent when the wicked swallow those more righteous than they?",
  "14": "You have made people like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler.",
  "15": "The enemy brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net, he gathers them in his seine; so he rejoices and exults.",
  "16": "Therefore he sacrifices to his net and makes offerings to his seine; for by them his portion is lavish, and his food is rich.",
  "17": "Is he then to keep on emptying his net, and destroying nations without mercy?"
