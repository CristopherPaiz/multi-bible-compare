  "1": "Alas for those who devise wickedness and evil deeds on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in their power.",
  "2": "They covet fields, and seize them; houses, and take them away; they oppress householder and house, people and their inheritance.",
  "3": "Therefore thus says the LORD: Now, I am devising against this family an evil from which you cannot remove your necks; and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be an evil time.",
  "4": "On that day they shall take up a taunt song against you, and wail with bitter lamentation, and say, \"We are utterly ruined; the LORD alters the inheritance of my people; how he removes it from me! Among our captors he parcels out our fields.\"",
  "5": "Therefore you will have no one to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.",
  "6": "\"Do not preach\"-- thus they preach-- \"one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us.\"",
  "7": "Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Is the LORD's patience exhausted? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to one who walks uprightly?",
  "8": "But you rise up against my people as an enemy; you strip the robe from the peaceful, from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war.",
  "9": "The women of my people you drive out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my glory forever.",
  "10": "Arise and go; for this is no place to rest, because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction.",
  "11": "If someone were to go about uttering empty falsehoods, saying, \"I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,\" such a one would be the preacher for this people!",
  "12": "I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob, I will gather the survivors of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture; it will resound with people.",
  "13": "The one who breaks out will go up before them; they will break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king will pass on before them, the LORD at their head."
