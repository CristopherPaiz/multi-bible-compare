  "1": "Woe is me! For I have become like one who, after the summer fruit has been gathered, after the vintage has been gleaned, finds no cluster to eat; there is no first-ripe fig for which I hunger.",
  "2": "The faithful have disappeared from the land, and there is no one left who is upright; they all lie in wait for blood, and they hunt each other with nets.",
  "3": "Their hands are skilled to do evil; the official and the judge ask for a bribe, and the powerful dictate what they desire; thus they pervert justice.",
  "4": "The best of them is like a brier, the most upright of them a thorn hedge. The day of their sentinels, of their punishment, has come; now their confusion is at hand.",
  "5": "Put no trust in a friend, have no confidence in a loved one; guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your embrace;",
  "6": "for the son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; your enemies are members of your own household.",
  "7": "But as for me, I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.",
  "8": "Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.",
  "9": "I must bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he takes my side and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall see his vindication.",
  "10": "Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, \"Where is the LORD your God?\" My eyes will see her downfall; now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.",
  "11": "A day for the building of your walls! In that day the boundary shall be far extended.",
  "12": "In that day they will come to you from Assyria to Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.",
  "13": "But the earth will be desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their doings.",
  "14": "Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock that belongs to you, which lives alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.",
  "15": "As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, show us marvelous things.",
  "16": "The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf;",
  "17": "they shall lick dust like a snake, like the crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their fortresses; they shall turn in dread to the LORD our God, and they shall stand in fear of you.",
  "18": "Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of your possession? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in showing clemency.",
  "19": "He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.",
  "20": "You will show faithfulness to Jacob and unswerving loyalty to Abraham, as you have sworn to our ancestors from the days of old."
