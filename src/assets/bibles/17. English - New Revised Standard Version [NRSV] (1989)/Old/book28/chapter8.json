  "1": "Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have broken my covenant, and transgressed my law.",

  "3": "Israel has spurned the good; the enemy shall pursue him.",
  "4": "They made kings, but not through me; they set up princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.",

  "14": "Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds."
