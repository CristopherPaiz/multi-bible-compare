  "2": "Swearing, lying, and murder, and stealing and adultery break out; bloodshed follows bloodshed.",
  "3": "Therefore the land mourns, and all who live in it languish; together with the wild animals and the birds of the air, even the fish of the sea are perishing.",
  "4": "Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest.",
  "5": "You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night, and I will destroy your mother.",
  "6": "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.",
  "7": "The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; they changed their glory into shame.",
