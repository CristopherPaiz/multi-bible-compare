  "1": "when I would heal Israel, the corruption of Ephraim is revealed, and the wicked deeds of Samaria; for they deal falsely, the thief breaks in, and the bandits raid outside.",
  "2": "But they do not consider that I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds surround them, they are before my face.",
  "3": "By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the officials by their treachery.",
  "4": "They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven, whose baker does not need to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.",
  "5": "On the day of our king the officials became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.",
  "6": "For they are kindled like an oven, their heart burns within them; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.",
  "7": "All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls upon me.",
  "8": "Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.",
  "9": "Foreigners devour his strength, but he does not know it; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, but he does not know it.",

  "11": "Ephraim has become like a dove, silly and without sense; they call upon Egypt, they go to Assyria.",

  "13": "Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.",
  "14": "They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; they gash themselves for grain and wine; they rebel against me.",
  "15": "It was I who trained and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me.",
  "16": "They turn to that which does not profit; they have become like a defective bow; their officials shall fall by the sword because of the rage of their tongue. So much for their babbling in the land of Egypt."
