  "1": "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.",
  "2": "The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.",
  "3": "Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them.",
  "4": "I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.",
  "5": "They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.",
  "6": "The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes.",
  "7": "My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all.",
  "8": "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender.",
  "9": "I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.",
  "10": "They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.",
  "11": "They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD.",
  "12": "Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God, and is faithful to the Holy One."
