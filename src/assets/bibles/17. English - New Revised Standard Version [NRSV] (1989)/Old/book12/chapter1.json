  "3": "But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, \"Get up, go to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?'",
  "4": "Now therefore thus says the LORD, 'You shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.'\" So Elijah went.",

  "8": "They answered him, \"A hairy man, with a leather belt around his waist.\" He said, \"It is Elijah the Tishbite.\"",

  "16": "and said to him, \"Thus says the LORD: Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,-- is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?-- therefore you shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.\"",
  "17": "So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. His brother, Jehoram succeeded him as king in the second year of King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.",
