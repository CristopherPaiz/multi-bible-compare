  "5": "He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.",

  "9": "But they did not listen; Manasseh misled them to do more evil than the nations had done that the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.",
  "10": "The LORD said by his servants the prophets,",
  "11": "\"Because King Manasseh of Judah has committed these abominations, has done things more wicked than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has caused Judah also to sin with his idols;",

  "13": "I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line for Samaria, and the plummet for the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.",
  "14": "I will cast off the remnant of my heritage, and give them into the hand of their enemies; they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,",
  "15": "because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, even to this day.\"",
