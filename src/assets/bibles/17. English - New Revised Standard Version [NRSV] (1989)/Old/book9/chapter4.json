  "4": "So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
  "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.",
  "6": "When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, \"What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?\" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,",
  "7": "the Philistines were afraid; for they said, \"Gods have come into the camp.\" They also said, \"Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.",
  "8": "Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.",
  "9": "Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, in order not to become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.\"",
  "10": "So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated, and they fled, everyone to his home. There was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.",
  "11": "The ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",

  "16": "The man said to Eli, \"I have just come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.\" He said, \"How did it go, my son?\"",
  "17": "The messenger replied, \"Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the troops; your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\"",
  "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.",

  "20": "As she was about to die, the women attending her said to her, \"Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.\" But she did not answer or give heed.",
  "21": "She named the child Ichabod, meaning, \"The glory has departed from Israel,\" because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",
  "22": "She said, \"The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.\""
