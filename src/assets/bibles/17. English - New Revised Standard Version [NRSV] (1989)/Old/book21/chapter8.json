  "2": "Keep the king's command because of your sacred oath.",
  "3": "Do not be terrified; go from his presence, do not delay when the matter is unpleasant, for he does whatever he pleases.",
  "4": "For the word of the king is powerful, and who can say to him, \"What are you doing?\"",
  "5": "Whoever obeys a command will meet no harm, and the wise mind will know the time and way.",
  "6": "For every matter has its time and way, although the troubles of mortals lie heavy upon them.",
