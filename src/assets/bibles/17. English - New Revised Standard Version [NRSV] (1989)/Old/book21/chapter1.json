  "1": "The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.",
  "2": "Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.",
  "3": "What do people gain from all the toil at which they toil under the sun?",
  "4": "A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.",
  "5": "The sun rises and the sun goes down, and hurries to the place where it rises.",
  "6": "The wind blows to the south, and goes around to the north; round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.",
  "7": "All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they continue to flow.",
  "8": "All things are wearisome; more than one can express; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, or the ear filled with hearing.",
  "9": "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.",
  "10": "Is there a thing of which it is said, \"See, this is new\"? It has already been, in the ages before us.",
  "11": "The people of long ago are not remembered, nor will there be any remembrance of people yet to come by those who come after them.",
  "12": "I, the Teacher, when king over Israel in Jerusalem,",
  "13": "applied my mind to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven; it is an unhappy business that God has given to human beings to be busy with.",
  "14": "I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun; and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.",
  "15": "What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.",
  "16": "I said to myself, \"I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.\"",
  "17": "And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a chasing after wind.",
  "18": "For in much wisdom is much vexation, and those who increase knowledge increase sorrow."
