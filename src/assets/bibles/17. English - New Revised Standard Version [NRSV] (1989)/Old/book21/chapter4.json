  "1": "Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. Look, the tears of the oppressed-- with no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power-- with no one to comfort them.",
  "2": "And I thought the dead, who have already died, more fortunate than the living, who are still alive;",
  "3": "but better than both is the one who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.",
  "4": "Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from one person's envy of another. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.",
  "5": "Fools fold their hands and consume their own flesh.",
  "6": "Better is a handful with quiet than two handfuls with toil, and a chasing after wind.",

  "13": "Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king, who will no longer take advice.",
  "14": "One can indeed come out of prison to reign, even though born poor in the kingdom.",
  "15": "I saw all the living who, moving about under the sun, follow that youth who replaced the king;",
  "16": "there was no end to all those people whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind."
