  "1": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "O Mortal, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one of their number as their sentinel;",
  "3": "and if the sentinel sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people;",
  "4": "then if any who hear the sound of the trumpet do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes them away, their blood shall be upon their own heads.",
  "5": "They heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; their blood shall be upon themselves. But if they had taken warning, they would have saved their lives.",
  "6": "But if the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any of them, they are taken away in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at the sentinel's hand.",
  "7": "So you, mortal, I have made a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.",
  "8": "If I say to the wicked, \"O wicked ones, you shall surely die,\" and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at your hand.",
  "9": "But if you warn the wicked to turn from their ways, and they do not turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but you will have saved your life.",
  "10": "Now you, mortal, say to the house of Israel, Thus you have said: \"Our transgressions and our sins weigh upon us, and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?\"",
  "11": "Say to them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from their ways and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?",
  "12": "And you, mortal, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not save them when they transgress; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, it shall not make them stumble when they turn from their wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by their righteousness when they sin.",
  "13": "Though I say to the righteous that they shall surely live, yet if they trust in their righteousness and commit iniquity, none of their righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that they have committed they shall die.",
  "14": "Again, though I say to the wicked, \"You shall surely die,\" yet if they turn from their sin and do what is lawful and right--",
  "15": "if the wicked restore the pledge, give back what they have taken by robbery, and walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity-- they shall surely live, they shall not die.",
  "16": "None of the sins that they have committed shall be remembered against them; they have done what is lawful and right, they shall surely live.",
  "17": "Yet your people say, \"The way of the Lord is not just,\" when it is their own way that is not just.",
  "18": "When the righteous turn from their righteousness, and commit iniquity, they shall die for it.",
  "19": "And when the wicked turn from their wickedness, and do what is lawful and right, they shall live by it.",
  "20": "Yet you say, \"The way of the Lord is not just.\" O house of Israel, I will judge all of you according to your ways!",
  "21": "In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, someone who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, \"The city has fallen.\"",
  "22": "Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; but he had opened my mouth by the time the fugitive came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer unable to speak.",
  "23": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "24": "Mortal, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, \"Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.\"",
  "25": "Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?",
  "26": "You depend on your swords, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?",
  "27": "Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and those who are in the open field I will give to the wild animals to be devoured; and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.",
  "28": "I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and its proud might shall come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through.",
  "29": "Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.",
  "30": "As for you, mortal, your people who talk together about you by the walls, and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to a neighbor, \"Come and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.\"",
  "31": "They come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not obey them. For flattery is on their lips, but their heart is set on their gain.",
  "32": "To them you are like a singer of love songs, one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; they hear what you say, but they will not do it.",
  "33": "When this comes-- and come it will!-- then they shall know that a prophet has been among them."
