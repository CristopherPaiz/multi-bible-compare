  "3": "speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon sprawling in the midst of its channels, saying, \"My Nile is my own; I made it for myself.\"",
  "4": "I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your channels stick to your scales. I will draw you up from your channels, with all the fish of your channels sticking to your scales.",
  "5": "I will fling you into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your channels; you shall fall in the open field, and not be gathered and buried. To the animals of the earth and to the birds of the air I have given you as food.",
  "6": "Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD because you were a staff of reed to the house of Israel;",
  "7": "when they grasped you with the hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and made all their legs unsteady.",

  "9": "and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they shall know that I am the LORD. Because you said, \"The Nile is mine, and I made it,\"",

  "11": "No human foot shall pass through it, and no animal foot shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.",
  "12": "I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.",
  "13": "Further, thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered;",
  "14": "and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin; and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.",
  "15": "It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations; and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.",
  "16": "The Egyptians shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel; they will recall their iniquity, when they turned to them for aid. Then they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.",
  "17": "In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:",
  "18": "Mortal, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had expended against it.",
  "19": "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will give the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army.",
  "20": "I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored, because they worked for me, says the Lord GOD.",
  "21": "On that day I will cause a horn to sprout up for the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they shall know that I am the LORD."
