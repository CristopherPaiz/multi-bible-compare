  "1": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "O mortal, how does the wood of the vine surpass all other wood-- the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?",
  "3": "Is wood taken from it to make anything? Does one take a peg from it on which to hang any object?",
  "4": "It is put in the fire for fuel; when the fire has consumed both ends of it and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?",
  "5": "When it was whole it was used for nothing; how much less-- when the fire has consumed it, and it is charred-- can it ever be used for anything!",
  "6": "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.",
  "7": "I will set my face against them; although they escape from the fire, the fire shall still consume them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.",
  "8": "And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, says the Lord GOD."
