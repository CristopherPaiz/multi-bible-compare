  "1": "And you, mortal, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.",
  "2": "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, \"Aha!\" and, \"The ancient heights have become our possession,\"",
  "3": "therefore prophesy, and say: Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they made you desolate indeed, and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became an object of gossip and slander among the people;",
  "4": "therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted towns, which have become a source of plunder and an object of derision to the rest of the nations all around;",
  "5": "therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I am speaking in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who, with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, took my land as their possession, because of its pasture, to plunder it.",
  "6": "Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the watercourses and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am speaking in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the insults of the nations;",
  "7": "therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer insults.",
  "8": "But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they shall soon come home.",
  "9": "See now, I am for you; I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown;",

  "16": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "17": "Mortal, when the house of Israel lived on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds; their conduct in my sight was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual period.",
  "18": "So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it.",
  "19": "I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them.",
  "20": "But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, \"These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.\"",
  "21": "But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.",
  "22": "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.",
  "23": "I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.",
  "24": "I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.",
  "25": "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.",
  "26": "A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.",
  "27": "I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.",
  "28": "Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.",
  "29": "I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you.",
  "30": "I will make the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field abundant, so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.",
  "31": "Then you shall remember your evil ways, and your dealings that were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable deeds.",
  "32": "It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and dismayed for your ways, O house of Israel.",

  "34": "The land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.",
  "35": "And they will say, \"This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are now inhabited and fortified.\"",
  "36": "Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it.",
  "37": "Thus says the Lord GOD: I will also let the house of Israel ask me to do this for them: to increase their population like a flock.",
  "38": "Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so shall the ruined towns be filled with flocks of people. Then they shall know that I am the LORD."
