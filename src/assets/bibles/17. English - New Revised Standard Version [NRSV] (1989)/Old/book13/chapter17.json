  "1": "Now when David settled in his house, David said to the prophet Nathan, \"I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.\"",
  "2": "Nathan said to David, \"Do all that you have in mind, for God is with you.\"",
  "3": "But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying:",
  "4": "Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the LORD: You shall not build me a house to live in.",
  "5": "For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought out Israel to this very day, but I have lived in a tent and a tabernacle.",
  "6": "Wherever I have moved about among all Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?",
  "7": "Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people Israel;",
  "8": "and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.",
  "9": "I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall wear them down no more, as they did formerly,",
  "10": "from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.",
  "11": "When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.",
  "12": "He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.",
  "13": "I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,",
  "14": "but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.",
  "15": "In accordance with all these words and all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.",
  "16": "Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, \"Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?",
  "17": "And even this was a small thing in your sight, O God; you have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come. You regard me as someone of high rank, O LORD God!",
  "18": "And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know your servant.",
  "19": "For your servant's sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all these great deeds, making known all these great things.",
  "20": "There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.",
  "21": "Who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and terrible things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt?",
  "22": "And you made your people Israel to be your people forever; and you, O LORD, became their God.",
  "23": "\"And now, O LORD, as for the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as you have promised.",
  "24": "Thus your name will be established and magnified forever in the saying, 'The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God'; and the house of your servant David will be established in your presence.",
  "25": "For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him; therefore your servant has found it possible to pray before you.",
  "26": "And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant;",
  "27": "therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you. For you, O LORD, have blessed and are blessed forever.\""
