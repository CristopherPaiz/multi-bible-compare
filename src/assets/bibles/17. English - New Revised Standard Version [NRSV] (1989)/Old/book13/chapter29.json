  "10": "Then David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly; David said: \"Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of our ancestor Israel, forever and ever.",
  "11": "Yours, O LORD, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.",
  "12": "Riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might; and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.",
  "13": "And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your glorious name.",
  "14": "\"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to make this freewill offering? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.",
  "15": "For we are aliens and transients before you, as were all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.",
  "16": "O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.",
  "17": "I know, my God, that you search the heart, and take pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.",
  "18": "O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.",
  "19": "Grant to my son Solomon that with single mind he may keep your commandments, your decrees, and your statutes, performing all of them, and that he may build the temple for which I have made provision.\"",
  "20": "Then David said to the whole assembly, \"Bless the LORD your God.\" And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king.",

  "22": "and they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great joy. They made David's son Solomon king a second time; they anointed him as the LORD's prince, and Zadok as priest.",
  "23": "Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD, succeeding his father David as king; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.",
  "24": "All the leaders and the mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.",
