  "3": "the officials of the Ammonites said to Hanun, \"Do you think, because David has sent consolers to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?\"",
  "4": "So Hanun seized David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at their hips, and sent them away;",
