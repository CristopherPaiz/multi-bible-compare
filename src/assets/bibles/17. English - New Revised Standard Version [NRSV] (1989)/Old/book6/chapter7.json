  "1": "But the Israelites broke faith in regard to the devoted things: Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.",
  "2": "Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, \"Go up and spy out the land.\" And the men went up and spied out Ai.",
  "3": "Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, \"Not all the people need go up; about two or three thousand men should go up and attack Ai. Since they are so few, do not make the whole people toil up there.\"",
  "4": "So about three thousand of the people went up there; and they fled before the men of Ai.",
  "5": "The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim and killing them on the slope. The hearts of the people melted and turned to water.",
  "6": "Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.",
  "7": "Joshua said, \"Ah, Lord GOD! Why have you brought this people across the Jordan at all, to hand us over to the Amorites so as to destroy us? Would that we had been content to settle beyond the Jordan!",
  "8": "O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned their backs to their enemies!",
  "9": "The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will you do for your great name?\"",
  "10": "The LORD said to Joshua, \"Stand up! Why have you fallen upon your face?",
  "11": "Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I imposed on them. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their own belongings.",
  "12": "Therefore the Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs to their enemies, because they have become a thing devoted for destruction themselves. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.",
  "13": "Proceed to sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \"There are devoted things among you, O Israel; you will be unable to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.\"",
  "14": "In the morning therefore you shall come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come near by clans, the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household that the LORD takes shall come near one by one.",
  "15": "And the one who is taken as having the devoted things shall be burned with fire, together with all that he has, for having transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and for having done an outrageous thing in Israel.'\"",
  "16": "So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.",
  "17": "He brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the clan of the Zerahites, family by family, and Zabdi was taken.",
  "18": "And he brought near his household one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",
  "19": "Then Joshua said to Achan, \"My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.\"",
  "20": "And Achan answered Joshua, \"It is true; I am the one who sinned against the LORD God of Israel. This is what I did:",
  "21": "when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. They now lie hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.\"",
  "22": "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.",
  "23": "They took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites; and they spread them out before the LORD.",
  "24": "Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, with the silver, the mantle, and the bar of gold, with his sons and daughters, with his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, and his tent and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.",
  "25": "Joshua said, \"Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD is bringing trouble on you today.\" And all Israel stoned him to death; they burned them with fire, cast stones on them,",
  "26": "and raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore that place to this day is called the Valley of Achor."
