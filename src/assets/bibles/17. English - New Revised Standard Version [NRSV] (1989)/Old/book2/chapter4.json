  "5": "\"so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.\"",

  "14": "Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, \"What of your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know that he can speak fluently; even now he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you his heart will be glad.",
  "15": "You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.",
  "16": "He indeed shall speak for you to the people; he shall serve as a mouth for you, and you shall serve as God for him.",
