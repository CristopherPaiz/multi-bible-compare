  "17": "In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.",
  "18": "Moses set up the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars;",
  "19": "and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it; as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "20": "He took the covenant and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above the ark;",
  "21": "and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the curtain for screening, and screened the ark of the covenant; as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "22": "He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain,",
  "23": "and set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.",

  "30": "He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing,",
  "31": "with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.",
  "32": "When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed; as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "33": "He set up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the screen at the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.",
  "34": "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.",
  "35": "Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.",
  "36": "Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on each stage of their journey;",
  "37": "but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up.",
  "38": "For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel at each stage of their journey."
