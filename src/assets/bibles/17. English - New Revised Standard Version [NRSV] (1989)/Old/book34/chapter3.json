  "1": "Ah! City of bloodshed, utterly deceitful, full of booty-- no end to the plunder!",
  "2": "The crack of whip and rumble of wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!",
  "3": "Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, piles of dead, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end-- they stumble over the bodies!",
  "4": "Because of the countless debaucheries of the prostitute, gracefully alluring, mistress of sorcery, who enslaves nations through her debaucheries, and peoples through her sorcery,",
  "5": "I am against you, says the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will let nations look on your nakedness and kingdoms on your shame.",
  "6": "I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt, and make you a spectacle.",
  "7": "Then all who see you will shrink from you and say, \"Nineveh is devastated; who will bemoan her?\" Where shall I seek comforters for you?",
  "8": "Are you better than Thebes that sat by the Nile, with water around her, her rampart a sea, water her wall?",
  "9": "Ethiopia was her strength, Egypt too, and that without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers.",
  "10": "Yet she became an exile, she went into captivity; even her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; lots were cast for her nobles, all her dignitaries were bound in fetters.",
  "11": "You also will be drunken, you will go into hiding; you will seek a refuge from the enemy.",
  "12": "All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs-- if shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.",
  "13": "Look at your troops: they are women in your midst. The gates of your land are wide open to your foes; fire has devoured the bars of your gates.",
  "14": "Draw water for the siege, strengthen your forts; trample the clay, tread the mortar, take hold of the brick mold!",
  "15": "There the fire will devour you, the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust, multiply like the grasshopper!",
  "16": "You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust sheds its skin and flies away.",
  "17": "Your guards are like grasshoppers, your scribes like swarms of locusts settling on the fences on a cold day-- when the sun rises, they fly away; no one knows where they have gone.",
  "18": "Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.",
  "19": "There is no assuaging your hurt, your wound is mortal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For who has ever escaped your endless cruelty?"
