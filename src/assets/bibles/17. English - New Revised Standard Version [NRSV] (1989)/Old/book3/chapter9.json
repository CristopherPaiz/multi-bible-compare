  "3": "And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;",
  "4": "and an ox and a ram for an offering of well-being to sacrifice before the LORD; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'\"",
  "5": "They brought what Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting; and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.",
  "6": "And Moses said, \"This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.\"",

  "8": "Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.",
  "9": "The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.",
  "10": "But the fat, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering he turned into smoke on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses;",
  "11": "and the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.",
  "12": "Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he dashed it against all sides of the altar.",
  "13": "And they brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, and the head, which he turned into smoke on the altar.",
  "14": "He washed the entrails and the legs and, with the burnt offering, turned them into smoke on the altar.",
  "15": "Next he presented the people's offering. He took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people, and slaughtered it, and presented it as a sin offering like the first one.",
  "16": "He presented the burnt offering, and sacrificed it according to regulation.",
  "17": "He presented the grain offering, and, taking a handful of it, he turned it into smoke on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.",
  "18": "He slaughtered the ox and the ram as a sacrifice of well-being for the people. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, which he dashed against all sides of the altar,",
  "19": "and the fat of the ox and of the ram-- the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the appendage of the liver.",
  "20": "They first laid the fat on the breasts, and the fat was turned into smoke on the altar;",
  "21": "and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron raised as an elevation offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.",
  "22": "Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the offering of well-being.",
  "23": "Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting, and then came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.",
  "24": "Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
