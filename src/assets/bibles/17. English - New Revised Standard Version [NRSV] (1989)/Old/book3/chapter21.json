  "5": "They shall not make bald spots upon their heads, or shave off the edges of their beards, or make any gashes in their flesh.",
  "6": "They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the LORD's offerings by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy.",

  "19": "or one who has a broken foot or a broken hand,",
  "20": "or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a blemish in his eyes or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles.",
  "21": "No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD's offerings by fire; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God.",
  "22": "He may eat the food of his God, of the most holy as well as of the holy.",
