  "3": "And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, \"Although you are barren, having borne no children, you shall conceive and bear a son.",
  "4": "Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or to eat anything unclean,",

  "6": "Then the woman came and told her husband, \"A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, most awe-inspiring; I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name;",
  "7": "but he said to me, 'You shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.'\"",
  "8": "Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, \"O, LORD, I pray, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born.\"",
  "9": "God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.",

  "13": "The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, \"Let the woman give heed to all that I said to her.",

  "16": "The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, \"If you detain me, I will not eat your food; but if you want to prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD.\" (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)",
  "17": "Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, \"What is your name, so that we may honor you when your words come true?\"",
  "18": "But the angel of the LORD said to him, \"Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful.\"",
  "19": "So Manoah took the kid with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to him who works wonders.",
