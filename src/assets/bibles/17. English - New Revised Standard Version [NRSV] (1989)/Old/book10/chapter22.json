  "21": "The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.",
  "22": "For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.",

  "29": "Indeed, you are my lamp, O LORD, the LORD lightens my darkness.",
  "30": "By you I can crush a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.",
  "31": "This God-- his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all who take refuge in him.",
  "32": "For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?",
  "33": "The God who has girded me with strength has opened wide my path.",
  "34": "He made my feet like the feet of deer, and set me secure on the heights.",
  "35": "He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.",
  "36": "You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your help has made me great.",

  "38": "I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.",
  "39": "I consumed them; I struck them down, so that they did not rise; they fell under my feet.",
  "40": "For you girded me with strength for the battle; you made my assailants sink under me.",
  "41": "You made my enemies turn their backs to me, those who hated me, and I destroyed them.",
  "42": "They looked, but there was no one to save them; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.",
  "43": "I beat them fine like the dust of the earth, I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.",
  "44": "You delivered me from strife with the peoples; you kept me as the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.",
  "45": "Foreigners came cringing to me; as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.",
  "46": "Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their strongholds.",
