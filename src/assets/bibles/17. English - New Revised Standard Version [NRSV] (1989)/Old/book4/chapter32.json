  "5": "They continued, \"If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not make us cross the Jordan.\"",
  "6": "But Moses said to the Gadites and to the Reubenites, \"Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?",
  "7": "Why will you discourage the hearts of the Israelites from going over into the land that the LORD has given them?",
  "8": "Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.",
  "9": "When they went up to the Wadi Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the hearts of the Israelites from going into the land that the LORD had given them.",
  "10": "The LORD's anger was kindled on that day and he swore, saying,",
  "11": "'Surely none of the people who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not unreservedly followed me--",
  "12": "none except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have unreservedly followed the LORD.'",
  "13": "And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD had disappeared.",
  "14": "And now you, a brood of sinners, have risen in place of your fathers, to increase the LORD's fierce anger against Israel!",
  "15": "If you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.\"",
  "16": "Then they came up to him and said, \"We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks, and towns for our little ones,",

  "19": "We will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.\"",
