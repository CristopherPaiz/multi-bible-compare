  "3": "So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them leading men among the Israelites.",
  "4": "These were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;",
  "5": "from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;",

  "18": "and see what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,",
  "19": "and whether the land they live in is good or bad, and whether the towns that they live in are unwalled or fortified,",
  "20": "and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be bold, and bring some of the fruit of the land.\" Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes.",
  "21": "So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.",
  "22": "They went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the Anakites, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)",
  "23": "And they came to the Wadi Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them. They also brought some pomegranates and figs.",
  "24": "That place was called the Wadi Eshcol, because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there.",
  "25": "At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.",
  "26": "And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.",
  "27": "And they told him, \"We came to the land to which you sent us; it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.",

  "31": "Then the men who had gone up with him said, \"We are not able to go up against this people, for they are stronger than we.\"",
  "32": "So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out, saying, \"The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size.",
  "33": "There we saw the Nephilim (the Anakites come from the Nephilim); and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.\""
