  "6": "And he said, \"Hear my words: When there are prophets among you, I the LORD make myself known to them in visions; I speak to them in dreams.",
  "7": "Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.",
  "8": "With him I speak face to face-- clearly, not in riddles; and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\"",

  "15": "So Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days; and the people did not set out on the march until Miriam had been brought in again.",
  "16": "After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran."
