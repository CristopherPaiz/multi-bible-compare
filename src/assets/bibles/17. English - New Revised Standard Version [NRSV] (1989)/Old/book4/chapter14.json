  "3": "Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become booty; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?\"",
  "4": "So they said to one another, \"Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt.\"",
  "5": "Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites.",
  "6": "And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes",

  "8": "If the LORD is pleased with us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.",
  "9": "Only, do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are no more than bread for us; their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them.\"",
  "10": "But the whole congregation threatened to stone them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.",
  "11": "And the LORD said to Moses, \"How long will this people despise me? And how long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?",
  "12": "I will strike them with pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.\"",
  "13": "But Moses said to the LORD, \"Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for in your might you brought up this people from among them,",

  "15": "Now if you kill this people all at one time, then the nations who have heard about you will say,",
  "16": "'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them that he has slaughtered them in the wilderness.'",
  "17": "And now, therefore, let the power of the LORD be great in the way that you promised when you spoke, saying,",
  "18": "'The LORD is slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and the fourth generation.'",
  "19": "Forgive the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have pardoned this people, from Egypt even until now.\"",

  "32": "But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.",
  "33": "And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.",
  "34": "According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.\"",
  "35": "I the LORD have spoken; surely I will do thus to all this wicked congregation gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.",
