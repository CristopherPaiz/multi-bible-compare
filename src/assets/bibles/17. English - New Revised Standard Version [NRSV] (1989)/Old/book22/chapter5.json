  "1": "I come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gather my myrrh with my spice, I eat my honeycomb with my honey, I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love.",
  "2": "I slept, but my heart was awake. Listen! my beloved is knocking. \"Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.\"",
  "3": "I had put off my garment; how could I put it on again? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?",
  "4": "My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, and my inmost being yearned for him.",
  "5": "I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.",
  "6": "I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but did not find him; I called him, but he gave no answer.",

  "9": "What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?",
  "10": "My beloved is all radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.",
  "11": "His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.",
  "12": "His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.",
  "13": "His cheeks are like beds of spices, yielding fragrance. His lips are lilies, distilling liquid myrrh.",
  "14": "His arms are rounded gold, set with jewels. His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.",
  "15": "His legs are alabaster columns, set upon bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.",
  "16": "His speech is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."
