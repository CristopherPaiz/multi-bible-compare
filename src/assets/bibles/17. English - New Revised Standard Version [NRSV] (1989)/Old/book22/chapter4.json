  "1": "How beautiful you are, my love, how very beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes of Gilead.",
  "2": "Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them is bereaved.",
  "3": "Your lips are like a crimson thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.",
  "4": "Your neck is like the tower of David, built in courses; on it hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors.",
  "5": "Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.",
  "6": "Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will hasten to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.",
  "7": "You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.",
  "8": "Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.",
  "9": "You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, you have ravished my heart with a glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.",
  "10": "How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! how much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!",
  "11": "Your lips distill nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.",
  "12": "A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a garden locked, a fountain sealed.",
  "13": "Your channel is an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,",
  "14": "nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices--",
  "15": "a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.",
  "16": "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden that its fragrance may be wafted abroad. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits."
