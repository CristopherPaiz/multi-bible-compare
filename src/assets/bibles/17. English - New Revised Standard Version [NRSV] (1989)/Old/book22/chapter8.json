  "2": "I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother, and into the chamber of the one who bore me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranates.",
  "3": "O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand embraced me!",
  "4": "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir up or awaken love until it is ready!",
  "5": "Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.",

  "11": "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.",
  "12": "My vineyard, my very own, is for myself; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred!",
  "13": "O you who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening for your voice; let me hear it.",
  "14": "Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of spices!"
