  "1": "How graceful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.",
  "2": "Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.",
  "3": "Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.",
  "4": "Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, overlooking Damascus.",
  "5": "Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.",
  "6": "How fair and pleasant you are, O loved one, delectable maiden!",
  "7": "You are stately as a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.",
  "8": "I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its branches. Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,",
  "9": "and your kisses like the best wine that goes down smoothly, gliding over lips and teeth.",
  "10": "I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.",
  "11": "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and lodge in the villages;",
  "12": "let us go out early to the vineyards, and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.",
  "13": "The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved."
