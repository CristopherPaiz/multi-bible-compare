  "1": "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.",
  "2": "As a lily among brambles, so is my love among maidens.",
  "3": "As an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.",
  "4": "He brought me to the banqueting house, and his intention toward me was love.",
  "5": "Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love.",
  "6": "O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand embraced me!",
  "7": "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the wild does: do not stir up or awaken love until it is ready!",
  "8": "The voice of my beloved! Look, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills.",
  "9": "My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he stands behind our wall, gazing in at the windows, looking through the lattice.",
  "10": "My beloved speaks and says to me: \"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away;",
  "11": "for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.",
  "12": "The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.",
  "13": "The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.",
  "14": "O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.",
  "15": "Catch us the foxes, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyards are in blossom.\"",
  "16": "My beloved is mine and I am his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.",
  "17": "Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on the cleft mountains."
