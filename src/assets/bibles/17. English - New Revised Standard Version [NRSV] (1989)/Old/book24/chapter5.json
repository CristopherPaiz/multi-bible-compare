  "11": "For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly faithless to me, says the LORD.",
  "12": "They have spoken falsely of the LORD, and have said, \"He will do nothing. No evil will come upon us, and we shall not see sword or famine.\"",
  "13": "The prophets are nothing but wind, for the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them!",
  "14": "Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: Because they have spoken this word, I am now making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall devour them.",

  "16": "Their quiver is like an open tomb; all of them are mighty warriors.",
  "17": "They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; they shall destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.",
  "18": "But even in those days, says the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.",
  "19": "And when your people say, \"Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?\" you shall say to them, \"As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.\"",
