  "3": "King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah saying, \"Please pray for us to the LORD our God.\"",

  "8": "And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.",
  "9": "Thus says the LORD: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, \"The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,\" for they will not go away.",
  "10": "Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.",

  "18": "Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, \"What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?",
  "19": "Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?",
  "20": "Now please hear me, my lord king: be good enough to listen to my plea, and do not send me back to the house of the secretary Jonathan to die there.\"",
  "21": "So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
