  "3": "Through breaches in the wall you shall leave, each one straight ahead; and you shall be flung out into Harmon, says the LORD.",
  "4": "Come to Bethel-- and transgress; to Gilgal-- and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days;",
  "5": "bring a thank offering of leavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel! says the Lord GOD.",
  "6": "I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.",
  "7": "And I also withheld the rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest; I would send rain on one city, and send no rain on another city; one field would be rained upon, and the field on which it did not rain withered;",

  "13": "For lo, the one who forms the mountains, creates the wind, reveals his thoughts to mortals, makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth-- the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name!"
