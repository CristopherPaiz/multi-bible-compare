  "5": "The Lord, GOD of hosts, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile, and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;",
  "6": "who builds his upper chambers in the heavens, and founds his vault upon the earth; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the surface of the earth-- the LORD is his name.",
  "7": "Are you not like the Ethiopians to me, O people of Israel? says the LORD. Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?",
  "8": "The eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth-- except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says the LORD.",

  "15": "I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be plucked up out of the land that I have given them, says the LORD your God."
