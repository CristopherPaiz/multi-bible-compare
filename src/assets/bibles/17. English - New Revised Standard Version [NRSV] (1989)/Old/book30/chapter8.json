  "1": "This is what the Lord GOD showed me-- a basket of summer fruit.",

  "3": "The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,\" says the Lord GOD; \"the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!\"",
  "4": "Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,",
  "5": "saying, \"When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,",

  "13": "In that day the beautiful young women and the young men shall faint for thirst.",
  "14": "Those who swear by Ashimah of Samaria, and say, \"As your god lives, O Dan,\" and, \"As the way of Beer-sheba lives\"-- they shall fall, and never rise again."
