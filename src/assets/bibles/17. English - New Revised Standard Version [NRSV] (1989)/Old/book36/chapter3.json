  "1": "Ah, soiled, defiled, oppressing city!",
  "2": "It has listened to no voice; it has accepted no correction. It has not trusted in the LORD; it has not drawn near to its God.",
  "3": "The officials within it are roaring lions; its judges are evening wolves that leave nothing until the morning.",
  "4": "Its prophets are reckless, faithless persons; its priests have profaned what is sacred, they have done violence to the law.",
  "5": "The LORD within it is righteous; he does no wrong. Every morning he renders his judgment, each dawn without fail; but the unjust knows no shame.",
  "6": "I have cut off nations; their battlements are in ruins; I have laid waste their streets so that no one walks in them; their cities have been made desolate, without people, without inhabitants.",
  "7": "I said, \"Surely the city will fear me, it will accept correction; it will not lose sight of all that I have brought upon it.\" But they were the more eager to make all their deeds corrupt.",
  "8": "Therefore wait for me, says the LORD, for the day when I arise as a witness. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all the heat of my anger; for in the fire of my passion all the earth shall be consumed.",
  "9": "At that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord.",
  "10": "From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, my scattered ones, shall bring my offering.",
  "11": "On that day you shall not be put to shame because of all the deeds by which you have rebelled against me; for then I will remove from your midst your proudly exultant ones, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain.",
  "12": "For I will leave in the midst of you a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD--",
  "13": "the remnant of Israel; they shall do no wrong and utter no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. Then they will pasture and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.",
  "14": "Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!",
  "15": "The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies. The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more.",
  "16": "On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.",
  "17": "The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing",
  "18": "as on a day of festival. I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.",
  "19": "I will deal with all your oppressors at that time. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.",
  "20": "At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you; for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD."
