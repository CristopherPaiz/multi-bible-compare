  "1": "An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone; because Kir is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone.",
  "2": "Dibon has gone up to the temple, to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. On every head is baldness, every beard is shorn;",
  "3": "in the streets they bind on sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears.",
  "4": "Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the loins of Moab quiver; his soul trembles.",
  "5": "My heart cries out for Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction;",
  "6": "the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the new growth fails, the verdure is no more.",
  "7": "Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Wadi of the Willows.",
  "8": "For a cry has gone around the land of Moab; the wailing reaches to Eglaim, the wailing reaches to Beer-elim.",
  "9": "For the waters of Dibon are full of blood; yet I will bring upon Dibon even more-- a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land."
