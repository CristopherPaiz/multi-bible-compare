  "1": "Ah, you destroyer, who yourself have not been destroyed; you treacherous one, with whom no one has dealt treacherously! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have stopped dealing treacherously, you will be dealt with treacherously.",
  "2": "O LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for you. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.",
  "3": "At the sound of tumult, peoples fled; before your majesty, nations scattered.",
  "4": "Spoil was gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, they leaped upon it.",
  "5": "The LORD is exalted, he dwells on high; he filled Zion with justice and righteousness;",
  "6": "he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.",
  "7": "Listen! the valiant cry in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.",
  "8": "The highways are deserted, travelers have quit the road. The treaty is broken, its oaths are despised, its obligation is disregarded.",
  "9": "The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.",
  "10": "\"Now I will arise,\" says the LORD, \"now I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.",
  "11": "You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.",
  "12": "And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.\"",
  "13": "Hear, you who are far away, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.",
  "14": "The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: \"Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting flames?\"",
  "15": "Those who walk righteously and speak uprightly, who despise the gain of oppression, who wave away a bribe instead of accepting it, who stop their ears from hearing of bloodshed and shut their eyes from looking on evil,",
  "16": "they will live on the heights; their refuge will be the fortresses of rocks; their food will be supplied, their water assured.",
  "17": "Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches far away.",
  "18": "Your mind will muse on the terror: \"Where is the one who counted? Where is the one who weighed the tribute? Where is the one who counted the towers?\"",
  "19": "No longer will you see the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a language that you cannot understand.",
  "20": "Look on Zion, the city of our appointed festivals! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be pulled up, and none of whose ropes will be broken.",
  "21": "But there the LORD in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass.",
  "22": "For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our ruler, the LORD is our king; he will save us.",
  "23": "Your rigging hangs loose; it cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out. Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will fall to plundering.",
  "24": "And no inhabitant will say, \"I am sick\"; the people who live there will be forgiven their iniquity."
