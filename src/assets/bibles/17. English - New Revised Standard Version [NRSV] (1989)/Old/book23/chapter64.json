  "1": "O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence--",
  "2": "as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!",
  "3": "When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.",
  "4": "From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.",
  "5": "You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways. But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.",
  "6": "We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.",
  "7": "There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.",
  "8": "Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.",

  "10": "Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.",
  "11": "Our holy and beautiful house, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.",
  "12": "After all this, will you restrain yourself, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and punish us so severely?"
