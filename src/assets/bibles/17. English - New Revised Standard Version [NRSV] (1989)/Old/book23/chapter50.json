  "1": "Thus says the LORD: Where is your mother's bill of divorce with which I put her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? No, because of your sins you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.",
  "2": "Why was no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? By my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water, and die of thirst.",
  "3": "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering.",
  "4": "The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. Morning by morning he wakens-- wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.",
  "5": "The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.",
  "6": "I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.",
  "7": "The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame;",

  "9": "It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty? All of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.",
  "10": "Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light, yet trusts in the name of the LORD and relies upon his God?",
  "11": "But all of you are kindlers of fire, lighters of firebrands. Walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled! This is what you shall have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment."
