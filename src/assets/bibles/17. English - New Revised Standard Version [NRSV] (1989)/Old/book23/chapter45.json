  "5": "I am the LORD, and there is no other; besides me there is no god. I arm you, though you do not know me,",
  "6": "so that they may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is no one besides me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.",
  "7": "I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe; I the LORD do all these things.",
  "8": "Shower, O heavens, from above, and let the skies rain down righteousness; let the earth open, that salvation may spring up, and let it cause righteousness to sprout up also; I the LORD have created it.",
  "9": "Woe to you who strive with your Maker, earthen vessels with the potter! Does the clay say to the one who fashions it, \"What are you making\"? or \"Your work has no handles\"?",
  "10": "Woe to anyone who says to a father, \"What are you begetting?\" or to a woman, \"With what are you in labor?\"",
  "11": "Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Will you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands?",

  "16": "All of them are put to shame and confounded, the makers of idols go in confusion together.",
  "17": "But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.",
  "18": "For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): I am the LORD, and there is no other.",
  "19": "I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, \"Seek me in chaos.\" I the LORD speak the truth, I declare what is right.",
  "20": "Assemble yourselves and come together, draw near, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge-- those who carry about their wooden idols, and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.",
  "21": "Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is no one besides me.",
  "22": "Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.",
  "23": "By myself I have sworn, from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return: \"To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.\"",
