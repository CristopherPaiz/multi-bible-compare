  "1": "On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; he sets up victory like walls and bulwarks.",

  "3": "Those of steadfast mind you keep in peace-- in peace because they trust in you.",
  "4": "Trust in the LORD forever, for in the LORD GOD you have an everlasting rock.",
  "5": "For he has brought low the inhabitants of the height; the lofty city he lays low. He lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.",
  "6": "The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.",
  "7": "The way of the righteous is level; O Just One, you make smooth the path of the righteous.",
  "8": "In the path of your judgments, O LORD, we wait for you; your name and your renown are the soul's desire.",
  "9": "My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.",
  "10": "If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the LORD.",

  "20": "Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the wrath is past.",
  "21": "For the LORD comes out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no longer cover its slain."
