  "1": "Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion! Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall enter you no more.",
  "2": "Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, O captive Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter Zion!",
  "3": "For thus says the LORD: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.",
  "4": "For thus says the Lord GOD: Long ago, my people went down into Egypt to reside there as aliens; the Assyrian, too, has oppressed them without cause.",
  "5": "Now therefore what am I doing here, says the LORD, seeing that my people are taken away without cause? Their rulers howl, says the LORD, and continually, all day long, my name is despised.",
  "6": "Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here am I.",
  "7": "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, \"Your God reigns.\"",

  "14": "Just as there were many who were astonished at him-- so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals--",
  "15": "so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate."
