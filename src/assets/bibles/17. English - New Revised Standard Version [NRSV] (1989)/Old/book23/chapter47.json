  "1": "Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.",
  "2": "Take the millstones and grind meal, remove your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.",
  "3": "Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one.",
  "4": "Our Redeemer-- the LORD of hosts is his name-- is the Holy One of Israel.",
  "5": "Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.",
  "6": "I was angry with my people, I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand, you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.",
  "7": "You said, \"I shall be mistress forever,\" so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.",
  "8": "Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, \"I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children\"--",

  "14": "See, they are like stubble, the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!",
  "15": "Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have trafficked with you from your youth; they all wander about in their own paths; there is no one to save you."
