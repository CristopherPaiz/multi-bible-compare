  "1": "I was ready to be sought out by those who did not ask, to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, \"Here I am, here I am,\" to a nation that did not call on my name.",
  "2": "I held out my hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;",
  "3": "a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and offering incense on bricks;",
  "4": "who sit inside tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat swine's flesh, with broth of abominable things in their vessels;",
  "5": "who say, \"Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.\" These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.",
  "6": "See, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their laps",
  "7": "their iniquities and their ancestors' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they offered incense on the mountains and reviled me on the hills, I will measure into their laps full payment for their actions.",
  "8": "Thus says the LORD: As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, \"Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,\" so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all.",
  "9": "I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there.",
  "10": "Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.",
  "11": "But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;",
  "12": "I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my sight, and chose what I did not delight in.",
  "13": "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;",
  "14": "my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.",
  "15": "You shall leave your name to my chosen to use as a curse, and the Lord GOD will put you to death; but to his servants he will give a different name.",
  "16": "Then whoever invokes a blessing in the land shall bless by the God of faithfulness, and whoever takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of faithfulness; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my sight.",
  "17": "For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.",
  "18": "But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating; for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.",
  "19": "I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.",
  "20": "No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime; for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.",
  "21": "They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.",
  "22": "They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.",
  "23": "They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; for they shall be offspring blessed by the LORD-- and their descendants as well.",
  "24": "Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.",
  "25": "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent-- its food shall be dust! They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the LORD."
