  "1": "Now the LORD is about to lay waste the earth and make it desolate, and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.",
  "2": "And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.",
  "3": "The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly despoiled; for the LORD has spoken this word.",
  "4": "The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers; the heavens languish together with the earth.",
  "5": "The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.",
  "6": "Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt; therefore the inhabitants of the earth dwindled, and few people are left.",
  "7": "The wine dries up, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.",
  "8": "The mirth of the timbrels is stilled, the noise of the jubilant has ceased, the mirth of the lyre is stilled.",
  "9": "No longer do they drink wine with singing; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.",
  "10": "The city of chaos is broken down, every house is shut up so that no one can enter.",
  "11": "There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine; all joy has reached its eventide; the gladness of the earth is banished.",
  "12": "Desolation is left in the city, the gates are battered into ruins.",
  "13": "For thus it shall be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is ended.",
  "14": "They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; they shout from the west over the majesty of the LORD.",
  "15": "Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea glorify the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.",
  "16": "From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! For the treacherous deal treacherously, the treacherous deal very treacherously.",
  "17": "Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!",
  "18": "Whoever flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit; and whoever climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.",
  "19": "The earth is utterly broken, the earth is torn asunder, the earth is violently shaken.",
  "20": "The earth staggers like a drunkard, it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.",
  "21": "On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and on earth the kings of the earth.",
  "22": "They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.",
  "23": "Then the moon will be abashed, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders he will manifest his glory."
