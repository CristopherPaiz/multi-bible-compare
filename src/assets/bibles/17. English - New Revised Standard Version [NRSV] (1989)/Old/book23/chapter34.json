  "1": "Draw near, O nations, to hear; O peoples, give heed! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it; the world, and all that comes from it.",
  "2": "For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, and furious against all their hoards; he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter.",
  "3": "Their slain shall be cast out, and the stench of their corpses shall rise; the mountains shall flow with their blood.",
  "4": "All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall wither like a leaf withering on a vine, or fruit withering on a fig tree.",
  "5": "When my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, lo, it will descend upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to judgment.",
  "6": "The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood, it is gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.",
  "7": "Wild oxen shall fall with them, and young steers with the mighty bulls. Their land shall be soaked with blood, and their soil made rich with fat.",
  "8": "For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of vindication by Zion's cause.",
  "9": "And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch.",
  "10": "Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and ever.",
  "11": "But the hawk and the hedgehog shall possess it; the owl and the raven shall live in it. He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, and the plummet of chaos over its nobles.",
  "12": "They shall name it No Kingdom There, and all its princes shall be nothing.",
  "13": "Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches.",
  "14": "Wildcats shall meet with hyenas, goat-demons shall call to each other; there too Lilith shall repose, and find a place to rest.",
  "15": "There shall the owl nest and lay and hatch and brood in its shadow; there too the buzzards shall gather, each one with its mate.",
  "16": "Seek and read from the book of the LORD: Not one of these shall be missing; none shall be without its mate. For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, and his spirit has gathered them.",
  "17": "He has cast the lot for them, his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; they shall possess it forever, from generation to generation they shall live in it."
