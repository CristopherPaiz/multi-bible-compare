  "1": "See, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.",
  "2": "Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.",
  "3": "Then the eyes of those who have sight will not be closed, and the ears of those who have hearing will listen.",
  "4": "The minds of the rash will have good judgment, and the tongues of stammerers will speak readily and distinctly.",
  "5": "A fool will no longer be called noble, nor a villain said to be honorable.",
  "6": "For fools speak folly, and their minds plot iniquity: to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink.",
  "7": "The villainies of villains are evil; they devise wicked devices to ruin the poor with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is right.",
  "8": "But those who are noble plan noble things, and by noble things they stand.",
  "9": "Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice; you complacent daughters, listen to my speech.",
  "10": "In little more than a year you will shudder, you complacent ones; for the vintage will fail, the fruit harvest will not come.",
  "11": "Tremble, you women who are at ease, shudder, you complacent ones; strip, and make yourselves bare, and put sackcloth on your loins.",
  "12": "Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,",
  "13": "for the soil of my people growing up in thorns and briers; yes, for all the joyous houses in the jubilant city.",
  "14": "For the palace will be forsaken, the populous city deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become dens forever, the joy of wild asses, a pasture for flocks;",
  "15": "until a spirit from on high is poured out on us, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.",
  "16": "Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.",
  "17": "The effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.",
  "18": "My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.",
  "19": "The forest will disappear completely, and the city will be utterly laid low.",
  "20": "Happy will you be who sow beside every stream, who let the ox and the donkey range freely."
