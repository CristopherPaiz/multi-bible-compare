  "1": "My child, if you have given your pledge to your neighbor, if you have bound yourself to another,",
  "2": "you are snared by the utterance of your lips, caught by the words of your mouth.",
  "3": "So do this, my child, and save yourself, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go, hurry, and plead with your neighbor.",
  "4": "Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;",
  "5": "save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, you lazybones; consider its ways, and be wise.",
  "7": "Without having any chief or officer or ruler,",
  "8": "it prepares its food in summer, and gathers its sustenance in harvest.",
  "9": "How long will you lie there, O lazybones? When will you rise from your sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,",
  "11": "and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want, like an armed warrior.",
  "12": "A scoundrel and a villain goes around with crooked speech,",
  "13": "winking the eyes, shuffling the feet, pointing the fingers,",
  "14": "with perverted mind devising evil, continually sowing discord;",
  "15": "on such a one calamity will descend suddenly; in a moment, damage beyond repair.",
  "16": "There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:",

  "22": "When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.",
  "23": "For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,",
  "24": "to preserve you from the wife of another, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.",
  "25": "Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;",

  "27": "Can fire be carried in the bosom without burning one's clothes?",
  "28": "Or can one walk on hot coals without scorching the feet?",
  "29": "So is he who sleeps with his neighbor's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.",
  "30": "Thieves are not despised who steal only to satisfy their appetite when they are hungry.",
  "31": "Yet if they are caught, they will pay sevenfold; they will forfeit all the goods of their house.",
  "32": "But he who commits adultery has no sense; he who does it destroys himself.",
