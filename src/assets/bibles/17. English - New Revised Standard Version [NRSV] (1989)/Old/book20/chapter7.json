  "8": "passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house",

  "22": "Right away he follows her, and goes like an ox to the slaughter, or bounds like a stag toward the trap",
  "23": "until an arrow pierces its entrails. He is like a bird rushing into a snare, not knowing that it will cost him his life.",
  "24": "And now, my children, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.",
  "25": "Do not let your hearts turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.",
