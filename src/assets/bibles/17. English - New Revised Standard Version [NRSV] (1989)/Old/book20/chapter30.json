  "1": "The words of Agur son of Jakeh. An oracle. Thus says the man: I am weary, O God, I am weary, O God. How can I prevail?",
  "2": "Surely I am too stupid to be human; I do not have human understanding.",
  "3": "I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the holy ones.",
  "4": "Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of the hand? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is the person's name? And what is the name of the person's child? Surely you know!",
  "5": "Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.",
  "6": "Do not add to his words, or else he will rebuke you, and you will be found a liar.",
  "7": "Two things I ask of you; do not deny them to me before I die:",
  "8": "Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that I need,",
  "9": "or I shall be full, and deny you, and say, \"Who is the LORD?\" or I shall be poor, and steal, and profane the name of my God.",
  "10": "Do not slander a servant to a master, or the servant will curse you, and you will be held guilty.",
  "11": "There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.",
  "12": "There are those who are pure in their own eyes yet are not cleansed of their filthiness.",
  "13": "There are those-- how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!",
  "14": "There are those whose teeth are swords, whose teeth are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mortals.",
  "15": "The leech has two daughters; \"Give, give,\" they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, \"Enough\":",
  "16": "Sheol, the barren womb, the earth ever thirsty for water, and the fire that never says, \"Enough.\"",
  "17": "The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.",
  "18": "Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:",
  "19": "the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a girl.",
  "20": "This is the way of an adulteress: she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, \"I have done no wrong.\"",
  "21": "Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:",
  "22": "a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when glutted with food;",
  "23": "an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.",
  "24": "Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:",
  "25": "the ants are a people without strength, yet they provide their food in the summer;",
  "26": "the badgers are a people without power, yet they make their homes in the rocks;",
  "27": "the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;",
  "28": "the lizard can be grasped in the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.",
  "29": "Three things are stately in their stride; four are stately in their gait:",
  "30": "the lion, which is mightiest among wild animals and does not turn back before any;",
  "31": "the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king striding before his people.",
  "32": "If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.",
  "33": "For as pressing milk produces curds, and pressing the nose produces blood, so pressing anger produces strife."
