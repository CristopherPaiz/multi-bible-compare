  "1": "My child, if you accept my words and treasure up my commandments within you,",
  "2": "making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;",
  "3": "if you indeed cry out for insight, and raise your voice for understanding;",
  "4": "if you seek it like silver, and search for it as for hidden treasures--",
  "5": "then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.",
  "6": "For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;",
  "7": "he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk blamelessly,",
  "8": "guarding the paths of justice and preserving the way of his faithful ones.",
  "9": "Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;",
  "10": "for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;",
  "11": "prudence will watch over you; and understanding will guard you.",
  "12": "It will save you from the way of evil, from those who speak perversely,",
  "13": "who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,",
  "14": "who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil;",
  "15": "those whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.",
  "16": "You will be saved from the loose woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,",
  "17": "who forsakes the partner of her youth and forgets her sacred covenant;",
  "18": "for her way leads down to death, and her paths to the shades;",
  "19": "those who go to her never come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.",
  "20": "Therefore walk in the way of the good, and keep to the paths of the just.",
  "21": "For the upright will abide in the land, and the innocent will remain in it;",
  "22": "but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it."
