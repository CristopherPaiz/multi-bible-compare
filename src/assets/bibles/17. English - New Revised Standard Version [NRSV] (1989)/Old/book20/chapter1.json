  "1": "The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:",
  "2": "For learning about wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight,",
  "3": "for gaining instruction in wise dealing, righteousness, justice, and equity;",
  "4": "to teach shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and prudence to the young--",
  "5": "Let the wise also hear and gain in learning, and the discerning acquire skill,",
  "6": "to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.",
  "7": "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
  "8": "Hear, my child, your father's instruction, and do not reject your mother's teaching;",
  "9": "for they are a fair garland for your head, and pendants for your neck.",
  "10": "My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.",
  "11": "If they say, \"Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us wantonly ambush the innocent;",
  "12": "like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole, like those who go down to the Pit.",
  "13": "We shall find all kinds of costly things; we shall fill our houses with booty.",
  "14": "Throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse\"--",
  "15": "my child, do not walk in their way, keep your foot from their paths;",
  "16": "for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood.",
  "17": "For in vain is the net baited while the bird is looking on;",
  "18": "yet they lie in wait-- to kill themselves! and set an ambush-- for their own lives!",
  "19": "Such is the end of all who are greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.",
  "20": "Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.",
  "21": "At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:",
  "22": "\"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?",
  "23": "Give heed to my reproof; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.",
  "24": "Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,",
  "25": "and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,",
  "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,",
  "27": "when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.",
  "28": "Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.",
  "29": "Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,",
  "30": "would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,",
  "31": "therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.",
  "32": "For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;",
  "33": "but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster.\""
