  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
  "2": "\"Can a mortal be of use to God? Can even the wisest be of service to him?",
  "3": "Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?",
  "4": "Is it for your piety that he reproves you, and enters into judgment with you?",
  "5": "Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.",
  "6": "For you have exacted pledges from your family for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.",
  "7": "You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.",
  "8": "The powerful possess the land, and the favored live in it.",
  "9": "You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the orphans you have crushed.",
  "10": "Therefore snares are around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,",
  "11": "or darkness so that you cannot see; a flood of water covers you.",
  "12": "\"Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!",
  "13": "Therefore you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?",
  "14": "Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the dome of heaven.'",
  "15": "Will you keep to the old way that the wicked have trod?",
  "16": "They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away by a flood.",
  "17": "They said to God, 'Leave us alone,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'",
  "18": "Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.",
  "19": "The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent laugh them to scorn,",
  "20": "saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left, the fire has consumed.'",
  "21": "\"Agree with God, and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.",
  "22": "Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored, if you remove unrighteousness from your tents,",
  "24": "if you treat gold like dust, and gold of Ophir like the stones of the torrent-bed,",
  "25": "and if the Almighty is your gold and your precious silver,",
  "26": "then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and lift up your face to God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.",
  "28": "You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.",
  "29": "When others are humiliated, you say it is pride; for he saves the humble.",
  "30": "He will deliver even those who are guilty; they will escape because of the cleanness of your hands.\""
