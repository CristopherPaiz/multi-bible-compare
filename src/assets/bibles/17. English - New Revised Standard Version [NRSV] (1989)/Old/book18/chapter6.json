  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"O that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!",
  "3": "For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.",
  "4": "For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.",
  "5": "Does the wild ass bray over its grass, or the ox low over its fodder?",
  "6": "Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any flavor in the juice of mallows?",
  "7": "My appetite refuses to touch them; they are like food that is loathsome to me.",
  "8": "\"O that I might have my request, and that God would grant my desire;",
  "9": "that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!",
  "10": "This would be my consolation; I would even exult in unrelenting pain; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?",
  "12": "Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?",
  "13": "In truth I have no help in me, and any resource is driven from me.",
  "14": "\"Those who withhold kindness from a friend forsake the fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed, like freshets that pass away,",
  "16": "that run dark with ice, turbid with melting snow.",
  "17": "In time of heat they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.",
  "18": "The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste, and perish.",
  "19": "The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.",
  "20": "They are disappointed because they were confident; they come there and are confounded.",
  "21": "Such you have now become to me; you see my calamity, and are afraid.",
  "22": "Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?",
  "23": "Or, 'Save me from an opponent's hand'? Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of oppressors'?",
  "24": "\"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone wrong.",
  "25": "How forceful are honest words! But your reproof, what does it reprove?",
  "26": "Do you think that you can reprove words, as if the speech of the desperate were wind?",
  "27": "You would even cast lots over the orphan, and bargain over your friend.",
  "28": "\"But now, be pleased to look at me; for I will not lie to your face.",
  "29": "Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done. Turn now, my vindication is at stake.",
  "30": "Is there any wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?"
