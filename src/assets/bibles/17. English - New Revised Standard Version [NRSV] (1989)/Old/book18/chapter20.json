  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:",
  "2": "\"Pay attention! My thoughts urge me to answer, because of the agitation within me.",
  "3": "I hear censure that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.",
  "4": "Do you not know this from of old, ever since mortals were placed on earth,",
  "5": "that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless is but for a moment?",
  "6": "Even though they mount up high as the heavens, and their head reaches to the clouds,",
  "7": "they will perish forever like their own dung; those who have seen them will say, 'Where are they?'",
  "8": "They will fly away like a dream, and not be found; they will be chased away like a vision of the night.",
  "9": "The eye that saw them will see them no more, nor will their place behold them any longer.",
  "10": "Their children will seek the favor of the poor, and their hands will give back their wealth.",
  "11": "Their bodies, once full of youth, will lie down in the dust with them.",
  "12": "\"Though wickedness is sweet in their mouth, though they hide it under their tongues,",
  "13": "though they are loath to let it go, and hold it in their mouths,",
  "14": "yet their food is turned in their stomachs; it is the venom of asps within them.",
  "15": "They swallow down riches and vomit them up again; God casts them out of their bellies.",
  "16": "They will suck the poison of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill them.",
  "17": "They will not look on the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.",
  "18": "They will give back the fruit of their toil, and will not swallow it down; from the profit of their trading they will get no enjoyment.",
  "19": "For they have crushed and abandoned the poor, they have seized a house that they did not build.",
  "20": "\"They knew no quiet in their bellies; in their greed they let nothing escape.",
  "21": "There was nothing left after they had eaten; therefore their prosperity will not endure.",
  "22": "In full sufficiency they will be in distress; all the force of misery will come upon them.",
  "23": "To fill their belly to the full God will send his fierce anger into them, and rain it upon them as their food.",
  "24": "They will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike them through.",
  "25": "It is drawn forth and comes out of their body, and the glittering point comes out of their gall; terrors come upon them.",
  "26": "Utter darkness is laid up for their treasures; a fire fanned by no one will devour them; what is left in their tent will be consumed.",
  "27": "The heavens will reveal their iniquity, and the earth will rise up against them.",
  "28": "The possessions of their house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath.",
  "29": "This is the portion of the wicked from God, the heritage decreed for them by God.\""
