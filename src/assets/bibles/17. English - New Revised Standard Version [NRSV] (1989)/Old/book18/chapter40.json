  "1": "And the LORD said to Job:",
  "2": "\"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Anyone who argues with God must respond.\"",
  "3": "Then Job answered the LORD:",
  "4": "\"See, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.",
  "5": "I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but will proceed no further.\"",
  "6": "Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:",
  "7": "\"Gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you declare to me.",
  "8": "Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?",
  "9": "Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?",
  "10": "\"Deck yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor.",
  "11": "Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on all who are proud, and abase them.",
  "12": "Look on all who are proud, and bring them low; tread down the wicked where they stand.",
  "13": "Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below.",
  "14": "Then I will also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can give you victory.",
  "15": "\"Look at Behemoth, which I made just as I made you; it eats grass like an ox.",
  "16": "Its strength is in its loins, and its power in the muscles of its belly.",
  "17": "It makes its tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are knit together.",
  "18": "Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron.",
  "19": "\"It is the first of the great acts of God-- only its Maker can approach it with the sword.",
  "20": "For the mountains yield food for it where all the wild animals play.",
  "21": "Under the lotus plants it lies, in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh.",
  "22": "The lotus trees cover it for shade; the willows of the wadi surround it.",
  "23": "Even if the river is turbulent, it is not frightened; it is confident though Jordan rushes against its mouth.",
  "24": "Can one take it with hooks or pierce its nose with a snare?"
