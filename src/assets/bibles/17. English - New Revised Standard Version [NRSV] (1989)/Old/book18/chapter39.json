  "2": "Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,",
  "3": "when they crouch to give birth to their offspring, and are delivered of their young?",
  "4": "Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open; they go forth, and do not return to them.",
  "5": "\"Who has let the wild ass go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,",
  "6": "to which I have given the steppe for its home, the salt land for its dwelling place?",
  "7": "It scorns the tumult of the city; it does not hear the shouts of the driver.",
  "8": "It ranges the mountains as its pasture, and it searches after every green thing.",
  "9": "\"Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will it spend the night at your crib?",
  "10": "Can you tie it in the furrow with ropes, or will it harrow the valleys after you?",
  "11": "Will you depend on it because its strength is great, and will you hand over your labor to it?",
  "12": "Do you have faith in it that it will return, and bring your grain to your threshing floor?",

  "20": "Do you make it leap like the locust? Its majestic snorting is terrible.",
  "21": "It paws violently, exults mightily; it goes out to meet the weapons.",
  "22": "It laughs at fear, and is not dismayed; it does not turn back from the sword.",
  "23": "Upon it rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin.",

  "25": "When the trumpet sounds, it says 'Aha!' From a distance it smells the battle, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.",
  "26": "\"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and spreads its wings toward the south?",
  "27": "Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes its nest on high?",

  "29": "From there it spies the prey; its eyes see it from far away.",
