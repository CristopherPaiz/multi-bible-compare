  "1": "Job again took up his discourse and said:",
  "2": "\"As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,",
  "3": "as long as my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,",
  "4": "my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.",
  "5": "Far be it from me to say that you are right; until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.",
  "6": "I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.",
  "7": "\"May my enemy be like the wicked, and may my opponent be like the unrighteous.",
  "8": "For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts them off, when God takes away their lives?",
  "9": "Will God hear their cry when trouble comes upon them?",
  "10": "Will they take delight in the Almighty? Will they call upon God at all times?",
  "11": "I will teach you concerning the hand of God; that which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.",
  "12": "All of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?",

  "17": "they may pile it up, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.",
  "18": "They build their houses like nests, like booths made by sentinels of the vineyard.",
  "19": "They go to bed with wealth, but will do so no more; they open their eyes, and it is gone.",
  "20": "Terrors overtake them like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries them off.",
  "21": "The east wind lifts them up and they are gone; it sweeps them out of their place.",
  "22": "It hurls at them without pity; they flee from its power in headlong flight.",
  "23": "It claps its hands at them, and hisses at them from its place."
