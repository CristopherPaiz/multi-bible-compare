  "1": "\"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down its tongue with a cord?",
  "2": "Can you put a rope in its nose, or pierce its jaw with a hook?",
  "3": "Will it make many supplications to you? Will it speak soft words to you?",
  "4": "Will it make a covenant with you to be taken as your servant forever?",
  "5": "Will you play with it as with a bird, or will you put it on leash for your girls?",
  "6": "Will traders bargain over it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill its skin with harpoons, or its head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "Lay hands on it; think of the battle; you will not do it again!",
  "9": "Any hope of capturing it will be disappointed; were not even the gods overwhelmed at the sight of it?",
  "10": "No one is so fierce as to dare to stir it up. Who can stand before it?",
  "11": "Who can confront it and be safe?-- under the whole heaven, who?",
  "12": "\"I will not keep silence concerning its limbs, or its mighty strength, or its splendid frame.",
  "13": "Who can strip off its outer garment? Who can penetrate its double coat of mail?",
  "14": "Who can open the doors of its face? There is terror all around its teeth.",
  "15": "Its back is made of shields in rows, shut up closely as with a seal.",
  "16": "One is so near to another that no air can come between them.",
  "17": "They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.",
  "18": "Its sneezes flash forth light, and its eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.",
  "19": "From its mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap out.",
  "20": "Out of its nostrils comes smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.",
  "21": "Its breath kindles coals, and a flame comes out of its mouth.",
  "22": "In its neck abides strength, and terror dances before it.",
  "23": "The folds of its flesh cling together; it is firmly cast and immovable.",
  "24": "Its heart is as hard as stone, as hard as the lower millstone.",
  "25": "When it raises itself up the gods are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.",
  "26": "Though the sword reaches it, it does not avail, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.",
  "27": "It counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.",
  "28": "The arrow cannot make it flee; slingstones, for it, are turned to chaff.",
  "29": "Clubs are counted as chaff; it laughs at the rattle of javelins.",
  "30": "Its underparts are like sharp potsherds; it spreads itself like a threshing sledge on the mire.",
  "31": "It makes the deep boil like a pot; it makes the sea like a pot of ointment.",
  "32": "It leaves a shining wake behind it; one would think the deep to be white-haired.",
  "33": "On earth it has no equal, a creature without fear.",
  "34": "It surveys everything that is lofty; it is king over all that are proud.\""
