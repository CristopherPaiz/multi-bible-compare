  "2": "\"Today also my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.",
  "3": "Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his dwelling!",
  "4": "I would lay my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.",
  "5": "I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.",
  "6": "Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.",
  "7": "There an upright person could reason with him, and I should be acquitted forever by my judge.",
  "8": "\"If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him;",

  "10": "But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I shall come out like gold.",
  "11": "My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.",
  "12": "I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured in my bosom the words of his mouth.",

  "14": "For he will complete what he appoints for me; and many such things are in his mind.",

  "16": "God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;",
  "17": "If only I could vanish in darkness, and thick darkness would cover my face!"
