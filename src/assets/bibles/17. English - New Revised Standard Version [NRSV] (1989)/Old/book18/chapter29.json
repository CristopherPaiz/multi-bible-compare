  "1": "Job again took up his discourse and said:",
  "2": "\"Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;",
  "3": "when his lamp shone over my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;",
  "4": "when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent;",
  "5": "when the Almighty was still with me, when my children were around me;",
  "6": "when my steps were washed with milk, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!",
  "7": "When I went out to the gate of the city, when I took my seat in the square,",
  "8": "the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose up and stood;",
  "9": "the nobles refrained from talking, and laid their hands on their mouths;",
  "10": "the voices of princes were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.",
  "11": "When the ear heard, it commended me, and when the eye saw, it approved;",
  "12": "because I delivered the poor who cried, and the orphan who had no helper.",
  "13": "The blessing of the wretched came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.",
  "14": "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.",
  "15": "I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.",
  "16": "I was a father to the needy, and I championed the cause of the stranger.",
  "17": "I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made them drop their prey from their teeth.",
  "18": "Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days like the phoenix;",

  "20": "my glory was fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'",
  "21": "\"They listened to me, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.",
  "22": "After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them like dew.",
  "23": "They waited for me as for the rain; they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.",
  "24": "I smiled on them when they had no confidence; and the light of my countenance they did not extinguish.",
  "25": "I chose their way, and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners."
