  "1": "Then Job answered the LORD:",
  "2": "\"I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.",
  "3": "'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.",
  "4": "'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to me.'",
  "5": "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;",
  "6": "therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\"",
  "7": "After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: \"My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.",
  "8": "Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done.\"",
  "9": "So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.",
  "10": "And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.",
  "11": "Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.",
  "12": "The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys.",
  "13": "He also had seven sons and three daughters.",
  "14": "He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.",
  "15": "In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.",
  "16": "After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children's children, four generations.",
  "17": "And Job died, old and full of days."
