  "3": "I will bring my knowledge from far away, and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.",
  "4": "For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.",
  "5": "\"Surely God is mighty and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.",
  "6": "He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.",
  "7": "He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.",
  "8": "And if they are bound in fetters and caught in the cords of affliction,",
  "9": "then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.",
  "10": "He opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.",
  "11": "If they listen, and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.",

  "21": "Beware! Do not turn to iniquity; because of that you have been tried by affliction.",

  "24": "\"Remember to extol his work, of which mortals have sung.",
  "25": "All people have looked on it; everyone watches it from far away.",
  "26": "Surely God is great, and we do not know him; the number of his years is unsearchable.",
  "27": "For he draws up the drops of water; he distills his mist in rain,",
  "28": "which the skies pour down and drop upon mortals abundantly.",
  "29": "Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?",
  "30": "See, he scatters his lightning around him and covers the roots of the sea.",
  "31": "For by these he governs peoples; he gives food in abundance.",
  "32": "He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.",
  "33": "Its crashing tells about him; he is jealous with anger against iniquity."
