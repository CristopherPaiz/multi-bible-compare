  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "\"I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.",
  "3": "Have windy words no limit? Or what provokes you that you keep on talking?",
  "4": "I also could talk as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you.",
  "5": "I could encourage you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.",

  "18": "\"O earth, do not cover my blood; let my outcry find no resting place.",
  "19": "Even now, in fact, my witness is in heaven, and he that vouches for me is on high.",
  "20": "My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,",
  "21": "that he would maintain the right of a mortal with God, as one does for a neighbor.",
  "22": "For when a few years have come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return."
