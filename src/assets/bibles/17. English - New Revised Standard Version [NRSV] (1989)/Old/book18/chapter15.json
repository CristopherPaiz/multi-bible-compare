  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
  "2": "\"Should the wise answer with windy knowledge, and fill themselves with the east wind?",
  "3": "Should they argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which they can do no good?",
  "4": "But you are doing away with the fear of God, and hindering meditation before God.",
  "5": "For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.",
  "6": "Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you.",
  "7": "\"Are you the firstborn of the human race? Were you brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us?",
  "10": "The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, those older than your father.",
  "11": "Are the consolations of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?",
  "12": "Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,",
  "13": "so that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?",
  "14": "What are mortals, that they can be clean? Or those born of woman, that they can be righteous?",
  "15": "God puts no trust even in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his sight;",
  "16": "how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, one who drinks iniquity like water!",
  "17": "\"I will show you; listen to me; what I have seen I will declare--",

  "20": "The wicked writhe in pain all their days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.",
  "21": "Terrifying sounds are in their ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon them.",
  "22": "They despair of returning from darkness, and they are destined for the sword.",
  "23": "They wander abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' They know that a day of darkness is ready at hand;",
  "24": "distress and anguish terrify them; they prevail against them, like a king prepared for battle.",
  "25": "Because they stretched out their hands against God, and bid defiance to the Almighty,",
  "26": "running stubbornly against him with a thick-bossed shield;",
  "27": "because they have covered their faces with their fat, and gathered fat upon their loins,",
  "28": "they will live in desolate cities, in houses that no one should inhabit, houses destined to become heaps of ruins;",
  "29": "they will not be rich, and their wealth will not endure, nor will they strike root in the earth;",
  "30": "they will not escape from darkness; the flame will dry up their shoots, and their blossom will be swept away by the wind.",
  "31": "Let them not trust in emptiness, deceiving themselves; for emptiness will be their recompense.",
  "32": "It will be paid in full before their time, and their branch will not be green.",
  "33": "They will shake off their unripe grape, like the vine, and cast off their blossoms, like the olive tree.",
  "34": "For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery.",
  "35": "They conceive mischief and bring forth evil and their heart prepares deceit.\""
