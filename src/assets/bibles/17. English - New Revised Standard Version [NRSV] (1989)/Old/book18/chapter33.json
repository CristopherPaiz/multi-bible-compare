  "1": "\"But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.",
  "2": "See, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.",
  "3": "My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.",
  "4": "The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.",
  "6": "See, before God I am as you are; I too was formed from a piece of clay.",
  "7": "No fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy on you.",
  "8": "\"Surely, you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the sound of your words.",
  "9": "You say, 'I am clean, without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.",
  "10": "Look, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy;",
  "11": "he puts my feet in the stocks, and watches all my paths.'",
  "12": "\"But in this you are not right. I will answer you: God is greater than any mortal.",
  "13": "Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of my words'?",
  "14": "For God speaks in one way, and in two, though people do not perceive it.",
  "15": "In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on mortals, while they slumber on their beds,",
  "16": "then he opens their ears, and terrifies them with warnings,",
  "17": "that he may turn them aside from their deeds, and keep them from pride,",
  "18": "to spare their souls from the Pit, their lives from traversing the River.",
  "19": "They are also chastened with pain upon their beds, and with continual strife in their bones,",
  "20": "so that their lives loathe bread, and their appetites dainty food.",
  "21": "Their flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen; and their bones, once invisible, now stick out.",
  "22": "Their souls draw near the Pit, and their lives to those who bring death.",
  "23": "Then, if there should be for one of them an angel, a mediator, one of a thousand, one who declares a person upright,",
  "24": "and he is gracious to that person, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the Pit; I have found a ransom;",
  "25": "let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.'",
  "26": "Then he prays to God, and is accepted by him, he comes into his presence with joy, and God repays him for his righteousness.",
  "27": "That person sings to others and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, and it was not paid back to me.",
  "28": "He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.'",
  "29": "\"God indeed does all these things, twice, three times, with mortals,",
  "30": "to bring back their souls from the Pit, so that they may see the light of life.",
  "31": "Pay heed, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.",
  "32": "If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.",
  "33": "If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.\""
