{
  "1": "\"A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble,",
  "2": "comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow and does not last.",
  "3": "Do you fix your eyes on such a one? Do you bring me into judgment with you?",
  "4": "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one can.",
  "5": "Since their days are determined, and the number of their months is known to you, and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,",
  "6": "look away from them, and desist, that they may enjoy, like laborers, their days.",
  "7": "\"For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.",
  "8": "Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,",
  "9": "yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.",
  "10": "But mortals die, and are laid low; humans expire, and where are they?",
  "11": "As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,",
  "12": "so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused out of their sleep.",
  "13": "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!",
  "14": "If mortals die, will they live again? All the days of my service I would wait until my release should come.",
  "15": "You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands.",
  "16": "For then you would not number my steps, you would not keep watch over my sin;",
  "17": "my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity.",
  "18": "\"But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place;",
  "19": "the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of mortals.",
  "20": "You prevail forever against them, and they pass away; you change their countenance, and send them away.",
  "21": "Their children come to honor, and they do not know it; they are brought low, and it goes unnoticed.",
  "22": "They feel only the pain of their own bodies, and mourn only for themselves.\""
