  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:",
  "2": "\"Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and should one full of talk be vindicated?",
  "3": "Should your babble put others to silence, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?",
  "4": "For you say, 'My conduct is pure, and I am clean in God's sight.'",
  "5": "But oh, that God would speak, and open his lips to you,",
  "6": "and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For wisdom is many-sided. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.",
  "7": "\"Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?",
  "8": "It is higher than heaven-- what can you do? Deeper than Sheol-- what can you know?",
  "9": "Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.",
  "10": "If he passes through, and imprisons, and assembles for judgment, who can hinder him?",
  "11": "For he knows those who are worthless; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?",
  "12": "But a stupid person will get understanding, when a wild ass is born human.",
  "13": "\"If you direct your heart rightly, you will stretch out your hands toward him.",
  "14": "If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and do not let wickedness reside in your tents.",
  "15": "Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure, and will not fear.",
  "16": "You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.",
  "17": "And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.",
  "18": "And you will have confidence, because there is hope; you will be protected and take your rest in safety.",
  "19": "You will lie down, and no one will make you afraid; many will entreat your favor.",
  "20": "But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last.\""
