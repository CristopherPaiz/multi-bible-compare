  "1": "After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.",
  "2": "Job said:",
  "3": "\"Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man-child is conceived.'",
  "4": "Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, or light shine on it.",
  "5": "Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds settle upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.",
  "6": "That night-- let thick darkness seize it! let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.",
  "7": "Yes, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry be heard in it.",
  "8": "Let those curse it who curse the Sea, those who are skilled to rouse up Leviathan.",
  "9": "Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none; may it not see the eyelids of the morning--",
  "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, and hide trouble from my eyes.",
  "11": "\"Why did I not die at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?",
  "12": "Why were there knees to receive me, or breasts for me to suck?",
  "13": "Now I would be lying down and quiet; I would be asleep; then I would be at rest",
  "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuild ruins for themselves,",
  "15": "or with princes who have gold, who fill their houses with silver.",
  "16": "Or why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like an infant that never sees the light?",
  "17": "There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.",
  "19": "The small and the great are there, and the slaves are free from their masters.",
  "20": "\"Why is light given to one in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,",
  "21": "who long for death, but it does not come, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;",
  "22": "who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they find the grave?",
  "23": "Why is light given to one who cannot see the way, whom God has fenced in?",
  "24": "For my sighing comes like my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.",
  "25": "Truly the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.",
  "26": "I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest; but trouble comes.\""
