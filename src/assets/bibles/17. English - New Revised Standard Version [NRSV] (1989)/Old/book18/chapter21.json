  "4": "As for me, is my complaint addressed to mortals? Why should I not be impatient?",
  "5": "Look at me, and be appalled, and lay your hand upon your mouth.",
  "6": "When I think of it I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh.",
  "7": "Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?",
  "8": "Their children are established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.",
  "9": "Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them.",
  "10": "Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and never miscarries.",
  "11": "They send out their little ones like a flock, and their children dance around.",
  "12": "They sing to the tambourine and the lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.",
  "13": "They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol.",
  "14": "They say to God, 'Leave us alone! We do not desire to know your ways.",
  "15": "What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?'",
  "16": "Is not their prosperity indeed their own achievement? The plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.",

  "21": "For what do they care for their household after them, when the number of their months is cut off?",

  "29": "Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony,",
  "30": "that the wicked are spared in the day of calamity, and are rescued in the day of wrath?",
  "31": "Who declares their way to their face, and who repays them for what they have done?",
  "32": "When they are carried to the grave, a watch is kept over their tomb.",
  "33": "The clods of the valley are sweet to them; everyone will follow after, and those who went before are innumerable.",
