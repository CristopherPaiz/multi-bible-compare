  "1": "The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.",
  "2": "Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.",
  "3": "There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;",
  "4": "yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In the heavens he has set a tent for the sun,",
  "5": "which comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.",
  "6": "Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and nothing is hid from its heat.",
  "7": "The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the decrees of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple;",
  "8": "the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is clear, enlightening the eyes;",
  "9": "the fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.",
  "10": "More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and drippings of the honeycomb.",
  "11": "Moreover by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.",
  "12": "But who can detect their errors? Clear me from hidden faults.",
  "13": "Keep back your servant also from the insolent; do not let them have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.",
  "14": "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer."
