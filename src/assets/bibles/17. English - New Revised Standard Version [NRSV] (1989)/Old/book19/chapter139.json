  "1": "O LORD, you have searched me and known me.",
  "2": "You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from far away.",
  "3": "You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.",
  "4": "Even before a word is on my tongue, O LORD, you know it completely.",
  "5": "You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.",
  "6": "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is so high that I cannot attain it.",
  "7": "Where can I go from your spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence?",
  "8": "If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.",
  "9": "If I take the wings of the morning and settle at the farthest limits of the sea,",

  "16": "Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed.",
  "17": "How weighty to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!",
  "18": "I try to count them-- they are more than the sand; I come to the end-- I am still with you.",
  "19": "O that you would kill the wicked, O God, and that the bloodthirsty would depart from me--",
  "20": "those who speak of you maliciously, and lift themselves up against you for evil!",
  "21": "Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?",
  "22": "I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.",
  "23": "Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts.",
  "24": "See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
