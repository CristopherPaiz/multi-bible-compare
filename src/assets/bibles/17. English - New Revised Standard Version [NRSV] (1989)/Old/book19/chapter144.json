  "1": "Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;",
  "2": "my rock and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues the peoples under me.",
  "3": "O LORD, what are human beings that you regard them, or mortals that you think of them?",
  "4": "They are like a breath; their days are like a passing shadow.",
  "5": "Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains so that they smoke.",
  "6": "Make the lightning flash and scatter them; send out your arrows and rout them.",
  "7": "Stretch out your hand from on high; set me free and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hand of aliens,",
  "8": "whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are false.",
  "9": "I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you,",
  "10": "the one who gives victory to kings, who rescues his servant David.",
  "11": "Rescue me from the cruel sword, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are false.",
  "12": "May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars, cut for the building of a palace.",
  "13": "May our barns be filled, with produce of every kind; may our sheep increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields,",
  "14": "and may our cattle be heavy with young. May there be no breach in the walls, no exile, and no cry of distress in our streets.",
  "15": "Happy are the people to whom such blessings fall; happy are the people whose God is the LORD."
