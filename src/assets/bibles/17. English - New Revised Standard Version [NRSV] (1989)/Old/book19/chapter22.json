  "1": "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?",
  "2": "O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.",
  "3": "Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.",
  "4": "In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.",
  "5": "To you they cried, and were saved; in you they trusted, and were not put to shame.",
  "6": "But I am a worm, and not human; scorned by others, and despised by the people.",
  "7": "All who see me mock at me; they make mouths at me, they shake their heads;",
  "8": "\"Commit your cause to the LORD; let him deliver-- let him rescue the one in whom he delights!\"",
  "9": "Yet it was you who took me from the womb; you kept me safe on my mother's breast.",
  "10": "On you I was cast from my birth, and since my mother bore me you have been my God.",
  "11": "Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.",
  "12": "Many bulls encircle me, strong bulls of Bashan surround me;",
  "13": "they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.",
  "14": "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;",
  "15": "my mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.",
  "16": "For dogs are all around me; a company of evildoers encircles me. My hands and feet have shriveled;",
  "17": "I can count all my bones. They stare and gloat over me;",
  "18": "they divide my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.",
  "19": "But you, O LORD, do not be far away! O my help, come quickly to my aid!",
  "20": "Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!",
  "21": "Save me from the mouth of the lion! From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me.",
  "22": "I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:",
  "23": "You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him; stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!",
  "24": "For he did not despise or abhor the affliction of the afflicted; he did not hide his face from me, but heard when I cried to him.",
  "25": "From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.",
  "26": "The poor shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD. May your hearts live forever!",
  "27": "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.",
  "28": "For dominion belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.",
  "29": "To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, and I shall live for him.",
  "30": "Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord,",
  "31": "and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, saying that he has done it."
