  "1": "Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or take the path that sinners tread, or sit in the seat of scoffers;",
  "2": "but their delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law they meditate day and night.",
  "3": "They are like trees planted by streams of water, which yield their fruit in its season, and their leaves do not wither. In all that they do, they prosper.",
  "4": "The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.",
  "5": "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;",
  "6": "for the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish."
