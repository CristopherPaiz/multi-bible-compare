  "1": "O LORD, God of my salvation, when, at night, I cry out in your presence,",
  "2": "let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry.",
  "3": "For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.",
  "4": "I am counted among those who go down to the Pit; I am like those who have no help,",
  "5": "like those forsaken among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.",
  "6": "You have put me in the depths of the Pit, in the regions dark and deep.",
  "7": "Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah",
  "8": "You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a thing of horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;",
  "9": "my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call on you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you.",
  "10": "Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the shades rise up to praise you? Selah",
  "11": "Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?",
  "12": "Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your saving help in the land of forgetfulness?",
  "13": "But I, O LORD, cry out to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.",
  "14": "O LORD, why do you cast me off? Why do you hide your face from me?",
  "15": "Wretched and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am desperate.",
  "16": "Your wrath has swept over me; your dread assaults destroy me.",
  "17": "They surround me like a flood all day long; from all sides they close in on me.",
  "18": "You have caused friend and neighbor to shun me; my companions are in darkness."
