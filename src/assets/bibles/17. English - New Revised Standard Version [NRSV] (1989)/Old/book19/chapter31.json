  "22": "I had said in my alarm, \"I am driven far from your sight.\" But you heard my supplications when I cried out to you for help.",
  "23": "Love the LORD, all you his saints. The LORD preserves the faithful, but abundantly repays the one who acts haughtily.",
  "24": "Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the LORD."
