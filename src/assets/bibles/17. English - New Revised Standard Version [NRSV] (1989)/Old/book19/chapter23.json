  "1": "The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.",
  "2": "He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters;",
  "3": "he restores my soul. He leads me in right paths for his name's sake.",
  "4": "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff-- they comfort me.",

  "6": "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD my whole life long."
