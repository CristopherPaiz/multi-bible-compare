  "1": "Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.",
  "2": "From you let my vindication come; let your eyes see the right.",
  "3": "If you try my heart, if you visit me by night, if you test me, you will find no wickedness in me; my mouth does not transgress.",
  "4": "As for what others do, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.",
  "5": "My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.",
  "6": "I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me, hear my words.",
  "7": "Wondrously show your steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.",
  "8": "Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,",
  "9": "from the wicked who despoil me, my deadly enemies who surround me.",
  "10": "They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.",
  "11": "They track me down; now they surround me; they set their eyes to cast me to the ground.",
  "12": "They are like a lion eager to tear, like a young lion lurking in ambush.",
  "13": "Rise up, O LORD, confront them, overthrow them! By your sword deliver my life from the wicked,",
  "14": "from mortals-- by your hand, O LORD-- from mortals whose portion in life is in this world. May their bellies be filled with what you have stored up for them; may their children have more than enough; may they leave something over to their little ones.",
  "15": "As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake I shall be satisfied, beholding your likeness."
