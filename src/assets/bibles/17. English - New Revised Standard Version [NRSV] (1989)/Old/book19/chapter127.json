  "1": "Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain.",
  "2": "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives sleep to his beloved.",
  "3": "Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward.",
  "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons of one's youth.",
  "5": "Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate."
