  "1": "Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty,",
  "2": "wrapped in light as with a garment. You stretch out the heavens like a tent,",
  "3": "you set the beams of your chambers on the waters, you make the clouds your chariot, you ride on the wings of the wind,",
  "4": "you make the winds your messengers, fire and flame your ministers.",
  "5": "You set the earth on its foundations, so that it shall never be shaken.",
  "6": "You cover it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.",
  "7": "At your rebuke they flee; at the sound of your thunder they take to flight.",
  "8": "They rose up to the mountains, ran down to the valleys to the place that you appointed for them.",
  "9": "You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.",
  "10": "You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills,",
  "11": "giving drink to every wild animal; the wild asses quench their thirst.",
  "12": "By the streams the birds of the air have their habitation; they sing among the branches.",
  "13": "From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.",
  "14": "You cause the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for people to use, to bring forth food from the earth,",
  "15": "and wine to gladden the human heart, oil to make the face shine, and bread to strengthen the human heart.",
  "16": "The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.",
  "17": "In them the birds build their nests; the stork has its home in the fir trees.",
  "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the coneys.",
  "19": "You have made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.",
  "20": "You make darkness, and it is night, when all the animals of the forest come creeping out.",
  "21": "The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.",
  "22": "When the sun rises, they withdraw and lie down in their dens.",
  "23": "People go out to their work and to their labor until the evening.",
  "24": "O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.",
  "25": "Yonder is the sea, great and wide, creeping things innumerable are there, living things both small and great.",
  "26": "There go the ships, and Leviathan that you formed to sport in it.",
  "27": "These all look to you to give them their food in due season;",
  "28": "when you give to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.",
  "29": "When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.",
  "30": "When you send forth your spirit, they are created; and you renew the face of the ground.",
  "31": "May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--",
  "32": "who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke.",
  "33": "I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.",
  "34": "May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.",
  "35": "Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!"
