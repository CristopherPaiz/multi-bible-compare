  "1": "Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth",
  "2": "before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh. Stir up your might, and come to save us!",
  "3": "Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved.",
  "4": "O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?",
  "5": "You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in full measure.",
  "6": "You make us the scorn of our neighbors; our enemies laugh among themselves.",
  "7": "Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved.",
  "8": "You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.",
  "9": "You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.",
  "10": "The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches;",
  "11": "it sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.",
  "12": "Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?",

  "14": "Turn again, O God of hosts; look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,",
  "15": "the stock that your right hand planted.",
  "16": "They have burned it with fire, they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.",
  "17": "But let your hand be upon the one at your right hand, the one whom you made strong for yourself.",
  "18": "Then we will never turn back from you; give us life, and we will call on your name.",
  "19": "Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved."
