  "1": "We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old:",
  "2": "you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;",
  "3": "for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm give them victory; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, for you delighted in them.",
  "4": "You are my King and my God; you command victories for Jacob.",
  "5": "Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down our assailants.",
  "6": "For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.",
  "7": "But you have saved us from our foes, and have put to confusion those who hate us.",
  "8": "In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah",
  "9": "Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies.",
  "10": "You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil.",
  "11": "You have made us like sheep for slaughter, and have scattered us among the nations.",
  "12": "You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.",
  "13": "You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.",
  "14": "You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.",
  "15": "All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face",
  "16": "at the words of the taunters and revilers, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.",
  "17": "All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, or been false to your covenant.",
  "18": "Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way,",
  "19": "yet you have broken us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with deep darkness.",
  "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god,",
  "21": "would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.",
  "22": "Because of you we are being killed all day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.",
  "23": "Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever!",
  "24": "Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?",
  "25": "For we sink down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.",
  "26": "Rise up, come to our help. Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love."
