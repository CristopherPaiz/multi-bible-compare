{
  "1": "O LORD, who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy hill?",
  "2": "Those who walk blamelessly, and do what is right, and speak the truth from their heart;",
  "3": "who do not slander with their tongue, and do no evil to their friends, nor take up a reproach against their neighbors;",
  "4": "in whose eyes the wicked are despised, but who honor those who fear the LORD; who stand by their oath even to their hurt;",
  "5": "who do not lend money at interest, and do not take a bribe against the innocent. Those who do these things shall never be moved."
