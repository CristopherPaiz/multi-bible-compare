  "1": "O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.",
  "2": "They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the air for food, the flesh of your faithful to the wild animals of the earth.",
  "3": "They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.",
  "4": "We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.",
  "5": "How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealous wrath burn like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.",
  "7": "For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.",
  "8": "Do not remember against us the iniquities of our ancestors; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.",
  "9": "Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.",
  "10": "Why should the nations say, \"Where is their God?\" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes.",
  "11": "Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power preserve those doomed to die.",
  "12": "Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors the taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord!",
  "13": "Then we your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise."
