  "1": "O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.",
  "2": "For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.",

  "7": "For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.",
  "8": "I am utterly spent and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.",

  "20": "Those who render me evil for good are my adversaries because I follow after good.",
  "21": "Do not forsake me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me;",
  "22": "make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation."
