  "1": "I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.",

  "3": "He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.",
  "4": "Happy are those who make the LORD their trust, who do not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after false gods.",
  "5": "You have multiplied, O LORD my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you. Were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can be counted.",
  "6": "Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.",

  "15": "Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, \"Aha, Aha!\"",
  "16": "But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, \"Great is the LORD!\"",
  "17": "As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God."
