  "1": "O LORD, you God of vengeance, you God of vengeance, shine forth!",

  "3": "O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?",
  "4": "They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.",
  "5": "They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.",
  "6": "They kill the widow and the stranger, they murder the orphan,",

  "20": "Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who contrive mischief by statute?",
  "21": "They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn the innocent to death.",
  "22": "But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.",
  "23": "He will repay them for their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out."
