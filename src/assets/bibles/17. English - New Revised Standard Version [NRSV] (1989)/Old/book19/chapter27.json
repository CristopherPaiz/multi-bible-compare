  "1": "The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?",
  "2": "When evildoers assail me to devour my flesh-- my adversaries and foes-- they shall stumble and fall.",
  "3": "Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident.",
  "4": "One thing I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: to live in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.",
  "5": "For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will set me high on a rock.",
  "6": "Now my head is lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD.",
  "7": "Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud, be gracious to me and answer me!",
  "8": "\"Come,\" my heart says, \"seek his face!\" Your face, LORD, do I seek.",
  "9": "Do not hide your face from me. Do not turn your servant away in anger, you who have been my help. Do not cast me off, do not forsake me, O God of my salvation!",
  "10": "If my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will take me up.",
  "11": "Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.",
  "12": "Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, and they are breathing out violence.",
  "13": "I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.",
  "14": "Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!"
