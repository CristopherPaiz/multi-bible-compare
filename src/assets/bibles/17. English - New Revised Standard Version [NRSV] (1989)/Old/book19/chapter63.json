  "1": "O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.",
  "2": "So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.",
  "3": "Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.",
  "4": "So I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands and call on your name.",
  "5": "My soul is satisfied as with a rich feast, and my mouth praises you with joyful lips",
  "6": "when I think of you on my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;",
  "7": "for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.",
  "8": "My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.",
  "9": "But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;",
  "10": "they shall be given over to the power of the sword, they shall be prey for jackals.",
  "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped."
