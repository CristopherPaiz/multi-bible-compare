  "1": "I call upon you, O LORD; come quickly to me; give ear to my voice when I call to you.",
  "2": "Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.",
  "3": "Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with those who work iniquity; do not let me eat of their delicacies.",
  "5": "Let the righteous strike me; let the faithful correct me. Never let the oil of the wicked anoint my head, for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.",
  "6": "When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that my words were pleasant.",
  "7": "Like a rock that one breaks apart and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.",
  "8": "But my eyes are turned toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; do not leave me defenseless.",
  "9": "Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers.",
  "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I alone escape."
