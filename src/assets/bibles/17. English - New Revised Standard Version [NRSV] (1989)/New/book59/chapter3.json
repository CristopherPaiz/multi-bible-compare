  "1": "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.",
  "2": "For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle.",
  "3": "If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies.",
  "4": "Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.",
  "5": "So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!",
  "6": "And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell.",
  "7": "For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,",
  "8": "but no one can tame the tongue-- a restless evil, full of deadly poison.",
  "9": "With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God.",

  "11": "Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water?",
  "12": "Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresbe",
  "13": "Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom.",
  "14": "But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth.",
  "15": "Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.",
  "16": "For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind.",
  "17": "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.",
  "18": "And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace."
