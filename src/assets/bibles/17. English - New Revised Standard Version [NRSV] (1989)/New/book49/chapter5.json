  "1": "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children,",
  "2": "and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.",
  "3": "But fornication and impurity of any kind, or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints.",
  "4": "Entirely out of place is obscene, silly, and vulgar talk; but instead, let there be thanksgiving.",
  "5": "Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure person, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient.",
  "7": "Therefore do not be associated with them.",
  "8": "For once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light--",
  "9": "for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.",
  "10": "Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.",
  "12": "For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly;",
  "13": "but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,",
  "14": "for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, \"Sleeper, awake! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\"",
  "15": "Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,",
  "16": "making the most of the time, because the days are evil.",
  "17": "So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.",
  "18": "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,",
  "19": "as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,",
  "20": "giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "21": "Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord.",
  "23": "For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior.",
  "24": "Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,",
  "26": "in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word,",
  "27": "so as to present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind-- yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish.",
  "28": "In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
  "29": "For no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,",
  "30": "because we are members of his body.",
  "31": "\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"",
  "32": "This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church.",
  "33": "Each of you, however, should love his wife as himself, and a wife should respect her husband."
