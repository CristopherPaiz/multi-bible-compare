  "1": "So I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit.",
  "2": "For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?",
  "3": "And I wrote as I did, so that when I came, I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice; for I am confident about all of you, that my joy would be the joy of all of you.",
  "4": "For I wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain, but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.",
  "5": "But if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but to some extent-- not to exaggerate it-- to all of you.",

  "14": "But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.",
  "15": "For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;",
  "16": "to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?",
  "17": "For we are not peddlers of God's word like so many; but in Christ we speak as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God and standing in his presence."
