  "21": "Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary.",
  "22": "When he did come out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak.",
  "23": "When his time of service was ended, he went to his home.",
  "24": "After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion. She said,",

  "37": "For nothing will be impossible with God.\"",
  "38": "Then Mary said, \"Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.\" Then the angel departed from her.",
  "39": "In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country,",
  "40": "where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.",
