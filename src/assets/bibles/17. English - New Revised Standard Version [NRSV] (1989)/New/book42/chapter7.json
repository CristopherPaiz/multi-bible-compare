  "7": "therefore I did not presume to come to you. But only speak the word, and let my servant be healed.",
  "8": "For I also am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and the slave does it.\"",

  "32": "They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not weep.'",
  "33": "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon';",
  "34": "the Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'",
  "35": "Nevertheless, wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\"",

  "45": "You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.",
  "46": "You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.",
  "47": "Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.\"",
