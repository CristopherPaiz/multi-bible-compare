  "3": "Then Pilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He answered, \"You say so.\"",
  "4": "Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find no basis for an accusation against this man.\"",
  "5": "But they were insistent and said, \"He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.\"",
  "6": "When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.",
  "7": "And when he learned that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.",
  "8": "When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign.",
  "9": "He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer.",
  "10": "The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.",
  "11": "Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate.",
  "12": "That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.",
  "13": "Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people,",
  "14": "and said to them, \"You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him.",
  "15": "Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.",
  "16": "I will therefore have him flogged and release him.\"",
  "17": "",
  "18": "Then they all shouted out together, \"Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!\"",

  "20": "Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;",
  "21": "but they kept shouting, \"Crucify, crucify him!\"",
  "22": "A third time he said to them, \"Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.\"",
  "23": "But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed.",
  "24": "So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted.",
  "25": "He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.",
  "26": "As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
  "27": "A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.",
  "28": "But Jesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.",
  "29": "For the days are surely coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'",
  "30": "Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us'; and to the hills, 'Cover us.'",
  "31": "For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"",

  "33": "When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.",
  "34": "Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\" And they cast lots to divide his clothing.",
  "35": "And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, \"He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!\"",
  "36": "The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,",
  "37": "and saying, \"If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!\"",
  "38": "There was also an inscription over him, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"",
  "39": "One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!\"",
  "40": "But the other rebuked him, saying, \"Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?",
  "41": "And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.\"",
  "42": "Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"",
  "43": "He replied, \"Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"",

  "50": "Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council,",
  "51": "had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.",
  "52": "This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.",
  "53": "Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid.",
  "54": "It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.",
  "55": "The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid.",
  "56": "Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
