  "1": "Then Jesus said to the disciples, \"There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property.",
  "2": "So he summoned him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.'",
  "3": "Then the manager said to himself, 'What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.",
  "4": "I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.'",
  "5": "So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'",
  "6": "He answered, 'A hundred jugs of olive oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.'",
  "7": "Then he asked another, 'And how much do you owe?' He replied, 'A hundred containers of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill and make it eighty.'",
  "8": "And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.",
  "9": "And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.",
  "10": "\"Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.",
  "11": "If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?",
  "12": "And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?",
  "13": "No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\"",
  "14": "The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they ridiculed him.",
  "15": "So he said to them, \"You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.",
  "16": "\"The law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone tries to enter it by force.",
  "17": "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.",
  "18": "\"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.",
  "19": "\"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.",
  "20": "And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,",
  "21": "who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man's table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.",
  "22": "The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.",
  "23": "In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.",
  "24": "He called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.'",
  "25": "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.",
  "26": "Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.'",
  "27": "He said, 'Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father's house--",
  "28": "for I have five brothers-- that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.'",
  "29": "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.'",
  "30": "He said, 'No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'",
  "31": "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'\""
