  "1": "Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him.",
  "2": "And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, \"This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.\"",
  "3": "So he told them this parable:",
  "4": "\"Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?",
  "5": "When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.",
  "6": "And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'",
  "7": "Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.",
  "8": "\"Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?",
  "9": "When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.'",
  "10": "Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"",
  "11": "Then Jesus said, \"There was a man who had two sons.",
  "12": "The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.' So he divided his property between them.",
  "13": "A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, and there he squandered his property in dissolute living.",
  "14": "When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need.",
  "15": "So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs.",
  "16": "He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.",
  "17": "But when he came to himself he said, 'How many of my father's hired hands have bread enough and to spare, but here I am dying of hunger!",
  "18": "I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you;",
  "19": "I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.\"'",
  "20": "So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him.",
  "21": "Then the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'",
  "22": "But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly, bring out a robe-- the best one-- and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.",
  "23": "And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;",
  "24": "for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!' And they began to celebrate.",
  "25": "\"Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
  "26": "He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.",
  "27": "He replied, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has got him back safe and sound.'",
  "28": "Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.",
  "29": "But he answered his father, 'Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends.",
  "30": "But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!'",
  "31": "Then the father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.",
  "32": "But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.'\""
