  "21": "\"Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. \"Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.",
  "22": "\"Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man.",
  "23": "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.",

  "33": "If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.",
  "34": "If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.",
  "35": "But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.",
  "36": "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.",
  "37": "\"Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven;",

  "42": "Or how can you say to your neighbor, 'Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.",
  "43": "\"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit;",
  "44": "for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.",
