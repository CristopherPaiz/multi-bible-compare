  "1": "Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,",
  "2": "a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord, and not any mortal, has set up.",
  "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.",

  "9": "not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.",
  "10": "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",
  "11": "And they shall not teach one another or say to each other, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.",
  "12": "For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.\"",
  "13": "In speaking of \"a new covenant,\" he has made the first one obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear."
