  "1": "Therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.",
  "2": "For if the message declared through angels was valid, and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty,",
  "3": "how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was declared at first through the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him,",

  "5": "Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.",
  "6": "But someone has testified somewhere, \"What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them?",
  "7": "You have made them for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned them with glory and honor,",

  "13": "And again, \"I will put my trust in him.\" And again, \"Here am I and the children whom God has given me.\"",
  "14": "Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,",
  "15": "and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.",
  "16": "For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham.",
  "17": "Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.",
  "18": "Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested."
