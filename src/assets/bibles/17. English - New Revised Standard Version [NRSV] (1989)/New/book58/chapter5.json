  "3": "and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.",
  "4": "And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.",

  "6": "as he says also in another place, \"You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.\"",
  "7": "In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.",
  "8": "Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered;",

  "12": "For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food;",
  "13": "for everyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is unskilled in the word of righteousness.",
  "14": "But solid food is for the mature, for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil."
