{
  "1": "This \"King Melchizedek of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him\";",
  "2": "and to him Abraham apportioned \"one-tenth of everything.\" His name, in the first place, means \"king of righteousness\"; next he is also king of Salem, that is, \"king of peace.\"",
  "3": "Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.",
  "4": "See how great he is! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.",
  "5": "And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their kindred, though these also are descended from Abraham.",
  "6": "But this man, who does not belong to their ancestry, collected tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises.",
  "7": "It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.",
  "8": "In the one case, tithes are received by those who are mortal; in the other, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.",
  "9": "One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,",
  "10": "for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.",
  "11": "Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood-- for the people received the law under this priesthood-- what further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than one according to the order of Aaron?",
  "12": "For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.",
  "13": "Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.",
  "14": "For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.",
  "15": "It is even more obvious when another priest arises, resembling Melchizedek,",
  "16": "one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but through the power of an indestructible life.",
  "17": "For it is attested of him, \"You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.\"",
  "18": "There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual",
  "19": "(for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.",
  "20": "This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their office without an oath,",
  "21": "but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said to him, \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever'\"--",
  "22": "accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.",
  "23": "Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;",
  "24": "but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.",
  "25": "Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.",
  "26": "For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.",
  "27": "Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself.",
  "28": "For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever."
