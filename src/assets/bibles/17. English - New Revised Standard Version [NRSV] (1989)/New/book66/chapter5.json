  "2": "and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, \"Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?\"",
  "3": "And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.",
  "4": "And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.",

  "13": "Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing, \"To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!\"",
  "14": "And the four living creatures said, \"Amen!\" And the elders fell down and worshiped."
