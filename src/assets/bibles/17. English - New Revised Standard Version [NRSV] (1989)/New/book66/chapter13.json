  "1": "And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads; and on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.",
  "2": "And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority.",
  "3": "One of its heads seemed to have received a death-blow, but its mortal wound had been healed. In amazement the whole earth followed the beast.",
  "4": "They worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, \"Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?\"",
  "5": "The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.",
  "6": "It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.",
  "7": "Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. It was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation,",
  "8": "and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slaughtered.",
  "9": "Let anyone who has an ear listen:",
  "10": "If you are to be taken captive, into captivity you go; if you kill with the sword, with the sword you must be killed. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.",
  "11": "Then I saw another beast that rose out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.",
  "12": "It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.",
  "13": "It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all;",
  "14": "and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast, it deceives the inhabitants of earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived;",
  "15": "and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.",
  "16": "Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,",
  "17": "so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.",
  "18": "This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six."
