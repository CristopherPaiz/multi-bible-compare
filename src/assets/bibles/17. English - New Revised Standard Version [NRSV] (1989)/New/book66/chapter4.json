  "4": "Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads.",
  "5": "Coming from the throne are flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God;",

  "11": "\"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.\""
