  "3": "and threw him into the pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let out for a little while.",
  "4": "Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.",
  "5": "(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.",

  "13": "And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done.",
  "14": "Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire;",
  "15": "and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire."
