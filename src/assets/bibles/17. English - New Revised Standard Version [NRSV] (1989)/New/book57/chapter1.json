  "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker,",
  "2": "to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:",
  "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "4": "When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God",
  "5": "because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus.",
  "6": "I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ.",
  "7": "I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.",
  "8": "For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty,",
  "9": "yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love-- and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus.",
  "10": "I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.",
  "11": "Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me.",
  "12": "I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.",
  "13": "I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel;",
  "14": "but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced.",
  "15": "Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever,",
  "16": "no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother-- especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
  "17": "So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.",
  "18": "If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.",
  "19": "I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self.",
  "20": "Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.",
  "21": "Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.",
  "22": "One thing more-- prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you.",
  "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,",
  "24": "and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.",
  "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
