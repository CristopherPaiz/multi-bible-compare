{
  "1": "You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!",
  "2": "The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?",
  "3": "Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?",
  "4": "Did you experience so much for nothing?-- if it really was for nothing.",
  "5": "Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?",
  "6": "Just as Abraham \"believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,\"",
  "7": "so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham.",
  "8": "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, \"All the Gentiles shall be blessed in you.\"",
  "9": "For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed.",
  "10": "For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, \"Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law.\"",
  "11": "Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law; for \"The one who is righteous will live by faith.\"",
  "12": "But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, \"Whoever does the works of the law will live by them.\"",
  "13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us-- for it is written, \"Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree\"--",
  "14": "in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
  "15": "Brothers and sisters, I give an example from daily life: once a person's will has been ratified, no one adds to it or annuls it.",
  "16": "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring; it does not say, \"And to offsprings,\" as of many; but it says, \"And to your offspring,\" that is, to one person, who is Christ.",
  "17": "My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.",
  "18": "For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.",
  "19": "Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator.",
  "20": "Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one.",
  "21": "Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law.",
  "22": "But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.",
  "23": "Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed.",
  "24": "Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.",
  "25": "But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian,",
  "26": "for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.",
  "27": "As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.",
  "28": "There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.",
  "29": "And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise."
