  "20": "In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!",
  "21": "Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,",

  "23": "they only heard it said, \"The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.\"",
  "24": "And they glorified God because of me."
