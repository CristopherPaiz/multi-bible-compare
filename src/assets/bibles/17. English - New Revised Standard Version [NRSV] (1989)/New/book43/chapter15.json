  "1": "\"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower.",
  "2": "He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.",
  "3": "You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.",
  "4": "Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.",
  "5": "I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.",
  "6": "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.",
  "7": "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.",
  "8": "My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.",
  "9": "As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.",
  "10": "If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.",

  "14": "You are my friends if you do what I command you.",
  "15": "I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father.",
  "16": "You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.",
  "17": "I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.",
  "18": "\"If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you.",
  "19": "If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world-- therefore the world hates you.",
  "20": "Remember the word that I said to you, 'Servants are not greater than their master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.",
  "21": "But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.",
  "22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "Whoever hates me hates my Father also.",
  "24": "If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.",
  "25": "It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'",
