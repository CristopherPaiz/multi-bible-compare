  "1": "As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth.",
  "2": "His disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\"",
  "3": "Jesus answered, \"Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God's works might be revealed in him.",
  "4": "We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.",
  "5": "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"",
  "6": "When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man's eyes,",
  "7": "saying to him, \"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam\" (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see.",
  "8": "The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, \"Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?\"",
  "9": "Some were saying, \"It is he.\" Others were saying, \"No, but it is someone like him.\" He kept saying, \"I am the man.\"",
  "10": "But they kept asking him, \"Then how were your eyes opened?\"",
  "11": "He answered, \"The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' Then I went and washed and received my sight.\"",
  "12": "They said to him, \"Where is he?\" He said, \"I do not know.\"",
  "13": "They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.",
  "14": "Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.",
  "15": "Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, \"He put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.\"",
  "16": "Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.\" But others said, \"How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?\" And they were divided.",
  "17": "So they said again to the blind man, \"What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\" He said, \"He is a prophet.\"",
  "18": "The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight",
  "19": "and asked them, \"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\"",
  "20": "His parents answered, \"We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;",
  "21": "but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.\"",
  "22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.",
  "23": "Therefore his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\"",
  "24": "So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, \"Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\"",
  "25": "He answered, \"I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\"",
  "26": "They said to him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"",
  "27": "He answered them, \"I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\"",
  "28": "Then they reviled him, saying, \"You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.",
  "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.\"",
  "30": "The man answered, \"Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.",
  "31": "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will.",
  "32": "Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.",
  "33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\"",
  "34": "They answered him, \"You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?\" And they drove him out.",
  "35": "Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"",
  "36": "He answered, \"And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.\"",
  "37": "Jesus said to him, \"You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he.\"",
  "38": "He said, \"Lord, I believe.\" And he worshiped him.",
  "39": "Jesus said, \"I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.\"",
  "40": "Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, \"Surely we are not blind, are we?\"",
  "41": "Jesus said to them, \"If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."
