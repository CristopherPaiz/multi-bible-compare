  "1": "\"Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit.",
  "2": "The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.",
  "3": "The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
  "4": "When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.",
  "5": "They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.\"",
  "6": "Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.",
  "7": "So again Jesus said to them, \"Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.",
  "8": "All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.",
  "9": "I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.",
  "10": "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.",
  "11": "\"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
  "12": "The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away-- and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.",
  "13": "The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.",
  "14": "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,",
  "15": "just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.",
  "16": "I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.",
  "17": "For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.",
  "18": "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\"",
  "19": "Again the Jews were divided because of these words.",
  "20": "Many of them were saying, \"He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why listen to him?\"",
  "21": "Others were saying, \"These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"",
  "22": "At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,",
  "23": "and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon.",
  "24": "So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\"",
  "25": "Jesus answered, \"I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name testify to me;",
  "26": "but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.",
  "27": "My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.",
  "28": "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.",
  "29": "What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father's hand.",
  "30": "The Father and I are one.\"",
  "31": "The Jews took up stones again to stone him.",
  "32": "Jesus replied, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?\"",
  "33": "The Jews answered, \"It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, though only a human being, are making yourself God.\"",
  "34": "Jesus answered, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods'?",
  "35": "If those to whom the word of God came were called 'gods'-- and the scripture cannot be annulled--",
  "36": "can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said, 'I am God's Son'?",
  "37": "If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me.",
  "38": "But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\"",
  "39": "Then they tried to arrest him again, but he escaped from their hands.",
  "40": "He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.",
  "41": "Many came to him, and they were saying, \"John performed no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.\"",
  "42": "And many believed in him there."
