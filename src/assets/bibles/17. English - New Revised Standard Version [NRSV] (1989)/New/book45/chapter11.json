  "1": "I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?",
  "3": "\"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.\"",
  "4": "But what is the divine reply to him? \"I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\"",
  "5": "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.",
  "6": "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.",
  "7": "What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,",
  "8": "as it is written, \"God gave them a sluggish spirit, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.\"",
  "9": "And David says, \"Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;",
  "10": "let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent.\"",
  "11": "So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.",
  "12": "Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!",
  "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry",
  "14": "in order to make my own people jealous, and thus save some of them.",
  "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead!",
  "16": "If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; and if the root is holy, then the branches also are holy.",
  "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,",
  "18": "do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.",
  "19": "You will say, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\"",
  "20": "That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.",
  "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.",
  "22": "Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.",
  "23": "And even those of Israel, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.",
  "24": "For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.",
  "25": "So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.",
  "26": "And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, \"Out of Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.\"",
  "27": "\"And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.\"",
  "28": "As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors;",
  "29": "for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.",
  "30": "Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,",
  "31": "so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.",
  "32": "For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.",
  "33": "O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!",
  "34": "\"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\"",
  "35": "\"Or who has given a gift to him, to receive a gift in return?\"",
  "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen."
