  "1": "Therefore you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.",
  "2": "You say, \"We know that God's judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth.\"",
  "3": "Do you imagine, whoever you are, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?",
  "4": "Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not realize that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?",
  "5": "But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.",
  "6": "For he will repay according to each one's deeds:",
  "7": "to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;",
  "8": "while for those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.",
  "9": "There will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,",
  "10": "but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.",
  "11": "For God shows no partiality.",
  "12": "All who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.",
  "13": "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God's sight, but the doers of the law who will be justified.",
  "14": "When Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, these, though not having the law, are a law to themselves.",
  "15": "They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness; and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them",
  "16": "on the day when, according to my gospel, God, through Jesus Christ, will judge the secret thoughts of all.",
  "17": "But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God",
  "18": "and know his will and determine what is best because you are instructed in the law,",
  "19": "and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,",
  "20": "a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,",
  "21": "you, then, that teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?",
  "22": "You that forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You that abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
  "23": "You that boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",
  "24": "For, as it is written, \"The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\"",
  "25": "Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
  "26": "So, if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?",
  "27": "Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law.",
  "28": "For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.",
  "29": "Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart-- it is spiritual and not literal. Such a person receives praise not from others but from God."
