  "1": "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God.",
  "2": "Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.",
  "3": "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive its approval;",

  "5": "Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.",
  "6": "For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, busy with this very thing.",
  "7": "Pay to all what is due them-- taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.",

  "9": "The commandments, \"You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not covet\"; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\"",
  "10": "Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.",

  "12": "the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light;",
  "13": "let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.",
  "14": "Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."
