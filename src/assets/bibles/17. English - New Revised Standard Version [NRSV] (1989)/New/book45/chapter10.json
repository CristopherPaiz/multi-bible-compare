  "1": "Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.",
  "2": "I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened.",
  "3": "For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God's righteousness.",
  "4": "For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.",
  "5": "Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that \"the person who does these things will live by them.\"",
  "6": "But the righteousness that comes from faith says, \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down)",
  "7": "\"or 'Who will descend into the abyss?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).",
  "8": "But what does it say? \"The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart\" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);",

  "16": "But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed our message?\"",
  "17": "So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.",
  "18": "But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for \"Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\"",
  "19": "Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, \"I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.\"",
  "20": "Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, \"I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.\"",
