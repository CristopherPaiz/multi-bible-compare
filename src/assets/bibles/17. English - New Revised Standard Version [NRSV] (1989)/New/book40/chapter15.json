  "1": "Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,",
  "2": "\"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands before they eat.\"",
  "3": "He answered them, \"And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?",
  "4": "For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.'",
  "5": "But you say that whoever tells father or mother, 'Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God,' then that person need not honor the father.",
  "6": "So, for the sake of your tradition, you make void the word of God.",
  "7": "You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:",
  "8": "'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;",
  "9": "in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.'\"",
  "10": "Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, \"Listen and understand:",
  "11": "it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.\"",
  "12": "Then the disciples approached and said to him, \"Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?\"",
  "13": "He answered, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.",
  "14": "Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.\"",
  "15": "But Peter said to him, \"Explain this parable to us.\"",
  "16": "Then he said, \"Are you also still without understanding?",
  "17": "Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?",
  "18": "But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles.",
  "19": "For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.",
  "20": "These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\"",
  "21": "Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon.",
  "22": "Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, \"Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon.\"",
  "23": "But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, \"Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.\"",
  "24": "He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"",
  "25": "But she came and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\"",
  "26": "He answered, \"It is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs.\"",
  "27": "She said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.\"",
  "28": "Then Jesus answered her, \"Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\" And her daughter was healed instantly.",
  "29": "After Jesus had left that place, he passed along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up the mountain, where he sat down.",
  "30": "Great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others. They put them at his feet, and he cured them,",
  "31": "so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.",
  "32": "Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.\"",
  "33": "The disciples said to him, \"Where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd?\"",
  "34": "Jesus asked them, \"How many loaves have you?\" They said, \"Seven, and a few small fish.\"",
  "35": "Then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,",
  "36": "he took the seven loaves and the fish; and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.",
  "37": "And all of them ate and were filled; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.",
  "38": "Those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.",
  "39": "After sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
