  "6": "I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.",
  "7": "But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.",

  "11": "He said to them, \"Suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath; will you not lay hold of it and lift it out?",
  "12": "How much more valuable is a human being than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\"",
  "13": "Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other.",

  "23": "All the crowds were amazed and said, \"Can this be the Son of David?\"",
  "24": "But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that this fellow casts out the demons.\"",
