  "11": "The head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who brought it to her mother.",
  "12": "His disciples came and took the body and buried it; then they went and told Jesus.",
  "13": "Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.",

  "20": "And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.",
  "21": "And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",
  "22": "Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.",
  "23": "And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,",
