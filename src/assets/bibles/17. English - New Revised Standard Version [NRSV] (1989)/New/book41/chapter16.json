  "18": "they will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\"",
  "19": "So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.",
  "20": "And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it."
