  "1": "Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him,",
  "2": "they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them.",
  "3": "(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands, thus observing the tradition of the elders;",
  "4": "and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it; and there are also many other traditions that they observe, the washing of cups, pots, and bronze kettles.)",
  "5": "So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, \"Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?\"",
  "6": "He said to them, \"Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;",
  "7": "in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.'",
  "8": "You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\"",
  "9": "Then he said to them, \"You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition!",
  "10": "For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.'",
  "11": "But you say that if anyone tells father or mother, 'Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban' (that is, an offering to God)--",
  "12": "then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother,",
  "13": "thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\"",
  "14": "Then he called the crowd again and said to them, \"Listen to me, all of you, and understand:",
  "15": "there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.\"",
  "16": "",
  "17": "When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
  "18": "He said to them, \"Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile,",
  "19": "since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?\" (Thus he declared all foods clean.)",
  "20": "And he said, \"It is what comes out of a person that defiles.",
  "21": "For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder,",
  "22": "adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly.",
  "23": "All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\"",
  "24": "From there he set out and went away to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice,",
  "25": "but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet.",
  "26": "Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.",
  "27": "He said to her, \"Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs.\"",
  "28": "But she answered him, \"Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\"",
  "29": "Then he said to her, \"For saying that, you may go-- the demon has left your daughter.\"",
  "30": "So she went home, found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.",
  "31": "Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis.",
  "32": "They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him.",
  "33": "He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.",
  "34": "Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, \"Ephphatha,\" that is, \"Be opened.\"",
  "35": "And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.",
  "36": "Then Jesus ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.",
  "37": "They were astounded beyond measure, saying, \"He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.\""
