  "2": "Some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\"",
  "3": "He answered them, \"What did Moses command you?\"",
  "4": "They said, \"Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.\"",
  "5": "But Jesus said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.",
  "6": "But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.'",
  "7": "'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,",
  "8": "and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.",
  "9": "Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\"",

  "17": "As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\"",
  "18": "Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.",
  "19": "You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.'\"",
  "20": "He said to him, \"Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.\"",
  "21": "Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, \"You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.\"",

  "23": "Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\"",
  "24": "And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!",
  "25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\"",
  "26": "They were greatly astounded and said to one another, \"Then who can be saved?\"",
  "27": "Jesus looked at them and said, \"For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.\"",

  "36": "And he said to them, \"What is it you want me to do for you?\"",
  "37": "And they said to him, \"Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\"",
  "38": "But Jesus said to them, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\"",
  "39": "They replied, \"We are able.\" Then Jesus said to them, \"The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;",
  "40": "but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\"",
