  "1": "As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, \"Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!\"",
  "2": "Then Jesus asked him, \"Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\"",
  "3": "When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,",
  "4": "\"Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?\"",
  "5": "Then Jesus began to say to them, \"Beware that no one leads you astray.",
  "6": "Many will come in my name and say, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray.",
  "7": "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come.",
  "8": "For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.",
  "9": "\"As for yourselves, beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them.",
  "10": "And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.",
  "11": "When they bring you to trial and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.",
  "12": "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death;",
  "13": "and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.",
  "14": "\"But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;",
  "15": "the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;",
  "16": "the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.",
  "17": "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!",
  "18": "Pray that it may not be in winter.",
  "19": "For in those days there will be suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, no, and never will be.",
  "20": "And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut short those days.",
  "21": "And if anyone says to you at that time, 'Look! Here is the Messiah!' or 'Look! There he is!'-- do not believe it.",
  "22": "False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.",
  "23": "But be alert; I have already told you everything.",
  "24": "\"But in those days, after that suffering, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,",
  "25": "and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.",
  "26": "Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' with great power and glory.",
  "27": "Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.",
  "28": "\"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.",
  "29": "So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.",
  "30": "Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.",
  "31": "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.",
  "32": "\"But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.",
  "33": "Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come.",
  "34": "It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.",
  "35": "Therefore, keep awake-- for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn,",
  "36": "or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.",
  "37": "And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.\""
