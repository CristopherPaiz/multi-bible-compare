  "6": "Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.",
  "7": "Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, \"The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.\"",
  "8": "We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.",
  "9": "We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.",

  "17": "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.",
  "18": "Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?",
  "19": "What do I imply then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
