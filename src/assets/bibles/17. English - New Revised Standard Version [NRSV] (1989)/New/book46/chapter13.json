  "1": "If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.",
  "2": "And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.",
  "4": "Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant",
  "5": "or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;",
  "6": "it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.",
  "7": "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.",

  "12": "For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.",
  "13": "And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love."
