  "1": "Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed.",
  "2": "Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church; rather they must serve them all the more, since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties.",
  "3": "Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness,",
  "4": "is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words. From these come envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions,",
  "5": "and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.",
  "6": "Of course, there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment;",

  "14": "to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "15": "which he will bring about at the right time-- he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.",
  "16": "It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.",
  "17": "As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.",
  "18": "They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share,",
  "19": "thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.",
  "20": "Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;",
