  "1": "When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Thou considerest diligently that which [is] before thee,",
  "2": "And thou hast put a knife to thy throat, If thou [art] a man of appetite.",
  "3": "Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it [is] lying food.",
  "4": "Labour not to make wealth, From thine own understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.",
  "5": "For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.",
  "6": "Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,",
  "7": "For as he hath thought in his soul, so [is] he, `Eat and drink,` saith he to thee, And his heart [is] not with thee.",
  "8": "Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up, And hast marred thy words that [are] sweet.",
  "9": "In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.",
  "10": "Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,",
  "11": "For their Redeemer [is] strong, He doth plead their cause with thee.",

  "13": "Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.",
  "14": "Thou with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol thou deliverest.",
  "15": "My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,",
  "16": "And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly.",
  "17": "Let not thy heart be envious at sinners, But -- in the fear of Jehovah all the day.",
  "18": "For, is there a posterity? Then thy hope is not cut off.",
  "19": "Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way thy heart,",
  "20": "Be not thou among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,",
  "21": "For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.",
  "22": "Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.",
  "23": "Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,",
  "24": "The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.",
  "25": "Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother, Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.",
  "26": "Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let thine eyes watch my ways.",
  "27": "For a harlot [is] a deep ditch, And a strange woman [is] a strait pit.",
  "28": "She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.",
  "29": "Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?",
  "30": "Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.",

  "32": "Its latter end -- as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.",
  "33": "Thine eyes see strange women, And thy heart speaketh perverse things.",
  "34": "And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.",
  "35": "`They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake -- I seek it yet again!`"
