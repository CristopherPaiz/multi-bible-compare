  "1": "My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,",
  "2": "Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,",
  "3": "Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,",
  "4": "Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,",
  "5": "Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.",
  "6": "Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;",
  "7": "Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,",
  "8": "She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.",
  "9": "Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,",
  "11": "And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.",
  "12": "A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking [with] perverseness of mouth,",
  "13": "Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,",
  "14": "Frowardness [is] in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.",
  "15": "Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.",
  "16": "These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven [are] abominations to His soul.",
  "17": "Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --",
  "18": "A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --",
  "19": "A false witness [who] doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren.",
  "20": "Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.",
  "21": "Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.",
  "22": "In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh [with] thee.",
  "23": "For a lamp [is] the command, And the law a light, And a way of life [are] reproofs of instruction,",
  "24": "To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.",
  "25": "Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.",
  "26": "For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.",
  "27": "Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?",
  "28": "Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?",
  "29": "So [is] he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.",
  "30": "They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,",
  "31": "And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.",
  "32": "He who committeth adultery [with] a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.",
  "33": "A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,",
  "34": "For jealousy [is] the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.",
  "35": "He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!"
