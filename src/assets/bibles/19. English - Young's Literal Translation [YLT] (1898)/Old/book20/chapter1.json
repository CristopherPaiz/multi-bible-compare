  "1": "Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:",
  "2": "For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,",
  "3": "For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,",
  "4": "For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion.",
  "5": "(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)",
  "6": "For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.",
  "7": "Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!",
  "8": "Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,",
  "9": "For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.",
  "10": "My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.",
  "11": "If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,",
  "12": "We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those going down [to] the pit,",
  "13": "Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with] spoil,",
  "14": "Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.`",
  "15": "My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,",
  "16": "For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.",
  "17": "Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.",
  "18": "And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.",
  "19": "So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.",
  "20": "Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,",
  "21": "At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:",
  "22": "`Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?",
  "23": "Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.",
  "24": "Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,",
  "25": "And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.",
  "26": "I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,",
  "27": "When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.",
  "28": "Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.",
  "29": "Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.",
  "30": "They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,",
  "31": "And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.",
  "32": "For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.",
  "33": "And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And [is] quiet from fear of evil!`"
