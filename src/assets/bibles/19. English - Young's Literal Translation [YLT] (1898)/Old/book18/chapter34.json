  "1": "And Elihu answereth and saith:",
  "2": "Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.",
  "3": "For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.",
  "4": "Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what [is] good.",
  "5": "For Job hath said, `I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,",
  "6": "Against my right do I lie? Mortal [is] mine arrow -- without transgression.`",
  "7": "Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,",
  "8": "And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.",
  "9": "For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.`",
  "10": "Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:",
  "11": "For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.",
  "12": "Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.",
  "13": "Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?",
  "14": "If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.",
  "15": "Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.",
  "16": "And if [there is] understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.",
  "17": "Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?",
  "18": "Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless,` Unto princes -- `Wicked?`",
  "19": "That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands [are] all of them.",
  "20": "[In] a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.",
  "21": "For His eyes [are] on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.",
  "22": "There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;",
  "23": "For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,",
  "24": "He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.",
  "25": "Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.",
  "26": "As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.",
  "27": "Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,",
  "28": "To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.",
  "29": "And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, [It is] the same.",
  "30": "From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;",
  "31": "For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away, I do not corruptly,",
  "32": "Besides [that which] I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done -- I do not add?`",
  "33": "By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused -- That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.",
  "34": "Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.",
  "35": "Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words [are] not with wisdom.",
  "36": "My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,",
  "37": "For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God."
