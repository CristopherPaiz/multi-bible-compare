  "2": "And Job answereth and saith: --",
  "3": "Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.`",
  "4": "That day -- let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it.",
  "5": "Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days.",
  "6": "That night -- let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come.",
  "7": "Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it.",
  "8": "Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan.",

  "19": "Small and great [are] there the same. And a servant [is] free from his lord.",
  "20": "Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the bitter soul?",
  "21": "Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures.",
  "22": "Who are glad -- unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave.",
  "23": "To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?",
  "24": "For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters [are] my roarings.",
  "25": "For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me.",
  "26": "I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest -- and trouble cometh!"
