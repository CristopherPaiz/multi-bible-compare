  "1": "My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "2": "I say unto God, `Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive [with] me.",
  "3": "Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?",
  "4": "Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth -- seest Thou?",
  "5": "As the days of man [are] Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?",
  "6": "That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?",
  "7": "For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.",
  "8": "Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!",
  "9": "Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.",

  "17": "Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare [are] with me.",
  "18": "And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.",
  "19": "As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,",
  "20": "Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,",
  "21": "Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,",
  "22": "A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade -- and no order, And the shining [is] as thick darkness.`"
