  "1": "Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down -- his tongue?",
  "2": "Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?",
  "3": "Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?",
  "4": "Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?",
  "5": "Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?",
  "6": "(Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the merchants!)",
  "7": "Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?",
  "8": "Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle -- do not add!",
  "9": "Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance is not one cast down?",
  "10": "None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who [is] he before Me stationeth himself?",
  "11": "Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it [is] mine.",
  "12": "I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter of might, And the grace of his arrangement.",
  "13": "Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?",
  "14": "The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth [are] terrible.",
  "15": "A pride -- strong ones of shields, Shut up -- a close seal.",
  "16": "One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter between them.",
  "17": "One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are not separated.",
  "18": "His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes [are] as the eyelids of the dawn.",
  "19": "Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.",
  "20": "Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and reeds.",
  "21": "His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his mouth goeth forth.",
  "22": "In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief exult.",
  "23": "The flakes of his flesh have adhered -- Firm upon him -- it is not moved.",
  "24": "His heart [is] firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower piece.",
  "25": "From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings they keep themselves free.",
  "26": "The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear -- dart -- and lance.",
  "27": "He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.",
  "28": "The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by him into stubble are stones of the sling.",
  "29": "As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.",
  "30": "Under him [are] sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on the mire.",
  "31": "He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as a pot of ointment.",
  "32": "After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the deep to be hoary.",
  "33": "There is not on the earth his like, That is made without terror.",
  "34": "Every high thing he doth see, He [is] king over all sons of pride."
