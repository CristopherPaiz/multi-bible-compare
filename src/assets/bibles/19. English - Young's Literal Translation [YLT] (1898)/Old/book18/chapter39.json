  "1": "Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!",
  "2": "Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!",
  "3": "They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely, Their pangs they cast forth.",
  "4": "Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they have gone out, And have not returned to them.",
  "5": "Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of the wild ass who opened?",
  "6": "Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings the barren land,",
  "7": "He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an exactor he heareth not.",
  "8": "The range of mountains [is] his pasture, And after every green thing he seeketh.",
  "9": "Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?",
  "10": "Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow [with] his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?",
  "11": "Dost thou trust in him because great [is] his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?",
  "12": "Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And [to] thy threshing-floor doth gather [it]?",
  "13": "The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion of the ostrich or hawk.",
  "14": "For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she doth warm them,",
  "15": "And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast of the field tread it down.",
  "16": "Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain [is] her labour without fear.",
  "17": "For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not given a portion To her in understanding:",
  "18": "At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth at the horse and at his rider.",
  "19": "Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck [with] a mane?",
  "20": "Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting [is] terrible.",
  "21": "They dig in a valley, and he rejoiceth in power, He goeth forth to meet the armour.",
  "22": "He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted, And he turneth not back from the face of the sword.",
  "23": "Against him rattle doth quiver, The flame of a spear, and a halbert.",
  "24": "With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground, And remaineth not stedfast Because of the sound of a trumpet.",
  "25": "Among the trumpets he saith, Aha, And from afar he doth smell battle, Roaring of princes and shouting.",
  "26": "By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?",
  "27": "At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?",
  "28": "A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a rock, and fortress.",
  "29": "From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his eyes look attentively,",
  "30": "And his brood gulph up blood, And where the pierced [are] -- there [is] he!"
