  "1": "Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?",
  "2": "As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,",
  "3": "So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.",
  "4": "If I lay down then I said, `When do I rise!` And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.",
  "5": "Clothed hath been my flesh [with] worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,",
  "6": "My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.",
  "7": "Remember Thou that my life [is] a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.",
  "8": "The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes [are] upon me -- and I am not.",
  "9": "Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.",
  "10": "He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.",
  "11": "Also I -- I withhold not my mouth -- I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "A sea-[monster] am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?",

  "14": "And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,",
  "15": "And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.",
  "16": "I have wasted away -- not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days [are] vanity.",
  "17": "What [is] man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?",
  "18": "And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?",
  "19": "How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.",
  "20": "I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself -- and what?",
  "21": "Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me -- and I am not!"
