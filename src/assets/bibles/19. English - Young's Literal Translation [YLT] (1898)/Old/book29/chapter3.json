  "1": "For lo, in those days, and in that time, When I turn back [to] the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,",
  "2": "Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance -- Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they have apportioned.",
  "3": "And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for wine, That they may drink.",
  "4": "And also, what [are] ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all circuits of Philistia? Recompence are ye rendering unto Me? And if ye are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn back your recompence on your head.",
  "5": "In that My silver and My gold ye took, And My desirable things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples.",
  "6": "And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border.",
  "7": "Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither ye have sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head,",
  "8": "And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a nation far off, for Jehovah hath spoken.",
  "9": "Proclaim ye this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.",
  "10": "Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to javelins, Let the weak say, `I [am] mighty.`",
  "11": "Haste, and come in, all ye nations round, And be gathered together, Thither cause to come down, O Jehovah, Thy mighty ones.",
  "12": "Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I sit to judge all the nations around.",
  "13": "Send ye forth a sickle, For ripened hath harvest, Come in, come down, for filled hath been the press, Overflowed hath wine-presses, For great [is] their wickedness.",
  "14": "Multitudes, multitudes [are] in the valley of decision, For near [is] the day of Jehovah in the valley of decision.",
  "15": "Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up their shining.",
  "16": "And Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And Jehovah [is] a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons of Israel.",
  "17": "And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem hath been holy, And strangers do not pass over into it again.",
  "18": "And it hath come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the mountains juice, And the hills do flow [with] milk, And all streams of Judah do go [with] water, And a fountain from the house of Jehovah goeth forth, And hath watered the valley of Shittim.",
  "19": "Egypt a desolation becometh, And Edom a desolation, a wilderness, becometh, For violence [to] sons of Judah, Whose innocent blood they shed in their land.",
  "20": "And Judah to the age doth dwell, And Jerusalem to generation and generation.",
  "21": "And I have declared their blood innocent, [That] I did not declare innocent, And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion!"
