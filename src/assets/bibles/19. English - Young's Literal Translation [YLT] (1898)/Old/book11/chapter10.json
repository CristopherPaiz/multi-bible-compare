  "16": "And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold -- six hundred of gold go up on the one target;",
  "17": "and three hundred shields of alloyed gold -- three pounds of gold go up on the one shield; and the king putteth them [in] the house of the forest of Lebanon.",
  "18": "And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and overlayeth it with refined gold;",
  "19": "six steps hath the throne, and a round top [is] to the throne behind it, and hands [are] on this [side] and on that, unto the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,",
