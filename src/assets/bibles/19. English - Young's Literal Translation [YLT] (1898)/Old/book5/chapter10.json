  "2": "and I write on the tables the words which were on the first tables, which thou hast broken, and thou hast placed them in the ark;",
  "3": "and I make an ark of shittim wood, and grave two tables of stone like the first, and go up to the mount, and the two tables in my hand.",
  "4": "`And He writeth on the tables, according to the first writing, the Ten Matters, which Jehovah hath spoken unto you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly, and Jehovah giveth them unto me,",
  "5": "and I turn and come down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made, and they are there, as Jehovah commanded me.",
