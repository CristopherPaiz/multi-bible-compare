  "1": "And David cometh in to Nob, unto Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech trembleth at meeting David, and saith to him, `Wherefore [art] thou thyself alone, and no man with thee?`",
  "2": "And David saith to Ahimelech the priest, `The king hath commanded me a matter, and he saith unto me, Let no man know anything of the matter about which I am sending thee, and which I have commanded thee; and the young men I have caused to know at such and such a place;",
  "3": "and now, what is there under thy hand? five loaves give into my hand, or that which is found.`",
  "4": "And the priest answereth David, and saith, `There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if the youths have been kept only from women.`",
  "5": "And David answereth the priest, and saith to him, `Surely, if women have been restrained from us as heretofore in my going out, then the vessels of the young men are holy, and it [is] a common way: and also, surely to-day it is sanctified in the vessel.`",

  "10": "And David riseth and fleeth on that day from the face of Saul, and cometh in unto Achish king of Gath;",

  "14": "And Achish saith unto his servants, `Lo, ye see a man acting as a madman; why do ye bring him in unto me?",
  "15": "A lack of madmen [have] I, that ye have brought in this one to act as a madman by me! doth this one come in unto my house?`"
