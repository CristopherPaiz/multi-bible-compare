  "20": "and we have been, even we, like all the nations; and our king hath judged us, and gone out before us, and fought our battles.`",
  "21": "And Samuel heareth all the words of the people, and speaketh them in the ears of Jehovah;",
  "22": "and Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to their voice, and thou hast caused to reign over them a king.` And Samuel saith unto the men of Israel, `Go ye each to his city.`"
