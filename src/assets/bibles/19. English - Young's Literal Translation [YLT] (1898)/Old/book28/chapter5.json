  "1": "`Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, And, O house of the king, give ear, For the judgment [is] for you, For, a snare ye have been on Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor.",
  "2": "And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I [am] a fetter to them all.",
  "3": "I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me, For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.",
  "4": "They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto their God, For a spirit of whoredoms [is] in their midst, And Jehovah they have not known.",
  "5": "And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also hath Judah with them.",
  "6": "With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them.",
  "7": "Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month [with] their portions.",

  "14": "For I [am] as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the house of Judah, I -- I tear and go, I bear away, and there is no deliverer.",
  "15": "I go -- I turn back unto My place, Till that they are desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do seek Me speedily!`"
