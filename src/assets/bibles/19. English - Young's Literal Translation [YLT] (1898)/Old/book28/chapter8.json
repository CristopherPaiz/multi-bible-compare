  "1": "`Unto thy mouth -- a trumpet, As an eagle against the house of Jehovah, Because they transgressed My covenant, And against My law they have rebelled.",
  "2": "To Me they cry, `My God, we -- Israel -- have known Thee.`",
  "3": "Cast off good hath Israel, an enemy pursueth him.",
  "4": "They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes, and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have made to them idols, So that they are cut off.",
  "5": "Cast off hath thy calf, O Samaria, Burned hath Mine anger against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?",
  "6": "For even it [is] of Israel; an artificer made it, And it [is] not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!",

  "14": "And forget doth Israel his Maker, and buildeth temples, And Judah hath multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire into his cities, And it hath consumed their palaces!"
