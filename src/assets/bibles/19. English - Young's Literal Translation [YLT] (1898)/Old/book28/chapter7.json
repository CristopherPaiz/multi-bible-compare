  "1": "`When I give healing to Israel, Then revealed is the iniquity of Ephraim, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they have wrought falsehood, And a thief doth come in, Stript off hath a troop in the street,",
  "2": "And they do not say to their heart, [That] all their evil I have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings, Over-against My face they have been.",
  "3": "With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their lies -- princes.",
  "4": "All of them [are] adulterers, Like a burning oven of a baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough, till its leavening.",
  "5": "A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves [with] the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.",
  "6": "For they have drawn near, As an oven [is] their heart, In their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker, Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.",
  "7": "All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none calling unto Me among them.",
  "8": "Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been a cake unturned.",
  "9": "Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known, Also old age hath sprinkled [itself] on him, And he hath not known.",
  "10": "And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have they sought Him for all this.",
  "11": "And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they called on -- [to] Asshur they have gone.",
  "12": "When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company hath heard.",
  "13": "Wo to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, And I -- I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me,",
  "14": "And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn aside against Me.",
  "15": "And I instructed -- I strengthened their arms, And concerning Me they think evil!",
  "16": "They turn back -- not to the Most High, They have been as a deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the insolence of their tongue, This [is] their derision in the land of Egypt!"
