  "1": "Because Israel [is] a youth, and I love him, Out of Egypt I have called for My Son.",
  "2": "They have called to them rightly, They have gone from before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images they make perfume.",
  "3": "And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.",

  "12": "Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim, And with deceit the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And with the Holy Ones [is] faithful!"
