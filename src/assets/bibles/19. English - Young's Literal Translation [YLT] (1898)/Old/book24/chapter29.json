  "8": "`For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Let not your prophets who [are] in your midst, and your diviners, lift you up, nor hearken ye unto their dreams, thay ye are causing [them] to dream;",
  "9": "For with falsehood they are prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them, an affirmation of Jehovah.",
