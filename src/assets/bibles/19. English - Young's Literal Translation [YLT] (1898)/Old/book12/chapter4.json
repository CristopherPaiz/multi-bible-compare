  "11": "And the day cometh, that he cometh in thither, and turneth aside unto the upper chamber, and lieth there,",
  "12": "and he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Call for this Shunammite;` and he calleth for her, and she standeth before him.",
  "13": "And he saith to him, `Say, I pray thee, unto her, Lo, thou hast troubled thyself concerning us with all this trouble; what -- to do for thee? is it to speak for thee unto the king, or unto the head of the host?` and she saith, `In the midst of my people I am dwelling.`",
  "14": "And he saith, `And what -- to do for her?` and Gehazi saith, `Verily she hath no son, and her husband [is] aged.`",

  "22": "and calleth unto her husband, and saith, `Send, I pray thee, to me, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I run unto the man of God, and return.`",
  "23": "And he saith, `Wherefore art thou going unto him to-day? -- neither new moon nor sabbath!` and she saith, `Peace [to thee]!`",
  "24": "And she saddleth the ass, and saith unto her young man, `Lead, and go, do not restrain riding for me, except I have said [so] to thee.`",
  "25": "And she goeth, and cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill of Carmel, and it cometh to pass, at the man of God`s seeing her from over-against, that he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Lo, this Shunammite;",
  "26": "now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is there peace to thee? is there peace to thy husband? is there peace to the lad?` and she saith, `Peace.`",
  "27": "And she cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill, and layeth hold on his feet, and Gehazi cometh nigh to thrust her away, and the man of God saith, `Let her alone, for her soul [is] bitter to her, and Jehovah hath hidden [it] from me, and hath not declared [it] to me.`",
  "28": "And she saith, `Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?`",
  "29": "And he saith to Gehazi, `Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go; when thou dost meet a man, thou dost not salute him; and when a man doth salute thee, thou dost not answer him; and thou hast laid my staff on the face of the youth.`",
  "30": "And the mother of the youth saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth -- if I leave thee;` and he riseth and goeth after her.",
  "31": "And Gehazi hath passed on before them, and layeth the staff on the face of the youth, and there is no voice, and there is no attention, and he turneth back to meet him, and declareth to him, saying, `The youth hath not awaked.`",
  "32": "And Elisha cometh in to the house, and lo, the youth is dead, laid on his bed,",
  "33": "and he goeth in and shutteth the door upon them both, and prayeth unto Jehovah.",
  "34": "And he goeth up, and lieth down on the lad, and putteth his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands, and stretcheth himself upon him, and the flesh of the lad becometh warm;",
  "35": "and he turneth back and walketh in the house, once hither and once thither, and goeth up and stretcheth himself upon him, and the youth sneezeth till seven times, and the youth openeth his eyes.",
  "36": "And he calleth unto Gehazi, and saith, `Call unto this Shunammite;` and he calleth her, and she cometh in unto him, and he saith, `Lift up thy son.`",
  "37": "And she goeth in, and falleth at his feet, and boweth herself to the earth, and lifteth up her son, and goeth out.",
  "38": "And Elisha hath turned back to Gilgal, and the famine [is] in the land, and the sons of the prophets are sitting before him, and he saith to his young man, `Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.`",
  "39": "And one goeth out unto the field to gather herbs, and findeth a vine of the field, and gathereth of it gourds of the field -- the fulness of his garment -- and cometh in and splitteth [them] into the pot of pottage, for they knew [them] not;",
  "40": "and they pour out for the men to eat, and it cometh to pass at their eating of the pottage, that they have cried out, and say, `Death [is] in the pot, O man of God!` and they have not been able to eat.",

  "43": "And his minister saith, `What -- do I give this before a hundred men?` and he saith, `Give to the people, and they eat, for thus said Jehovah, Eat and leave;`",
  "44": "and he giveth before them, and they eat and leave, according to the word of Jehovah."
