  "2": "`Rise, go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim unto it the proclamation that I am speaking unto thee;`",
  "3": "and Jonah riseth, and he goeth unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. And Nineveh hath been a great city before God, a journey of three days.",
  "4": "And Jonah beginneth to go in to the city a journey of one day, and proclaimeth, and saith, `Yet forty days -- and Nineveh is overturned.`",
  "5": "And the men of Nineveh believe in God, and proclaim a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their greatest even unto their least,",

  "10": "And God seeth their works, that they have turned back from their evil way, and God repenteth of the evil that He spake of doing to them, and he hath not done [it]."
