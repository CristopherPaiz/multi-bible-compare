  "3": "And not dazzled are the eyes of beholders, And the ears of hearers do attend.",

  "5": "A fool is no more called `noble,` And to a miser it is not said, `rich;`",
  "6": "For a fool speaketh folly, And his heart doth iniquity, to do profanity, And to speak concerning Jehovah error, To empty the soul of the hungry, Yea, drink of the thirsty he causeth to lack.",

  "16": "And dwelt in the wilderness hath judgment, And righteousness in the fruitful field remaineth.",
  "17": "And a work of the righteousness hath been peace, And a service of the righteousness -- Keeping quiet and confidence unto the age.",
  "18": "And dwelt hath My people in a peaceful habitation, And in stedfast tabernacles, And in quiet resting-places.",
  "19": "And it hath hailed in the going down of the forest, And in the valley is the city low.",
  "20": "Happy [are] ye sowing by all waters, Sending forth the foot of the ox and the ass!"
