  "3": "Strengthen ye the feeble hands, Yea, the stumbling knees strengthen.",
  "4": "Say to the hastened of heart, `Be strong, Fear not, lo, your God; vengeance cometh, The recompence of God, He Himself doth come and save you.`",
  "5": "Then opened are eyes of the blind, And ears of the deaf are unstopped,",
  "6": "Then leap as a hart doth the lame, And sing doth the tongue of the dumb, For broken up in a wilderness have been waters, And streams in a desert.",
