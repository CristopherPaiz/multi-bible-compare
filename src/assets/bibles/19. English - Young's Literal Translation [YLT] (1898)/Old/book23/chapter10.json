  "8": "For he saith, `Are not my princes altogether kings?",
  "9": "Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?",

  "11": "Do I not -- as I have done to Samaria, And to her worthless things, So do to Jerusalem and to her grievous things?",

  "14": "And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the peoples, And as a gathering of forsaken eggs All the earth I -- I have gathered, And there hath not been one moving wing, Or opening mouth, or whispering.`",

  "17": "And the light of Israel hath been for a fire, And his Holy One for a flame, And it hath burned, and devoured his thorn And his brier in one day.",
  "18": "And the honour of his forest, and his fruitful field, From soul even unto flesh He doth consume, And it hath been as the fainting of a standard-bearer.",
  "19": "And the rest of the trees of his forest [are] few, And a youth doth write them.",
