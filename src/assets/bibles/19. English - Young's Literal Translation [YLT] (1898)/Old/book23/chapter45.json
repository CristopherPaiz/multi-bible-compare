  "1": "Thus said Jehovah, To His anointed, to Cyrus, Whose right hand I have laid hold on, To subdue nations before him, Yea, loins of kings I loose, To open before him two-leaved doors, Yea, gates are not shut:",

  "3": "And have given to thee treasures of darkness, Even treasures of secret places, So that thou knowest that I, Jehovah, Who am calling on thy name -- [am] the God of Israel.",
  "4": "For the sake of my servant Jacob, And of Israel My chosen, I call also thee by thy name, I surname thee, And thou hast not known Me.",
  "5": "I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else, Except Me there is no God, I gird thee, and thou hast not known Me.",
  "6": "So that they know from the rising of the sun, And from the west, that there is none besides Me, I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else,",
  "7": "Forming light, and preparing darkness, Making peace, and preparing evil, I [am] Jehovah, doing all these things.`",
  "8": "Drop, ye heavens, from above, And clouds do cause righteousness to flow, Earth openeth, and they are fruitful, Salvation and righteousness spring up together, I, Jehovah, have prepared it.",
  "9": "Wo [to] him who is striving with his Former, (A potsherd with potsherds of the ground!) Doth clay say to its Framer, `What dost thou?` And thy work, `He hath no hands?`",
  "10": "Wo [to] him who is saying to a father, `What dost thou beget?` Or to a wife, `What dost thou bring forth?",
  "11": "Thus said Jehovah, The Holy One of Israel, and his Former: Ask Me of the things coming concerning My sons, Yea, concerning the work of My hands, ye command Me.`",
  "12": "I made earth, and man on it prepared, I -- My hands stretched out the heavens, And all their host I have commanded.",
  "13": "I have stirred him up in righteousness, And all his ways I make straight, He doth build My city, and My captivity doth send out, Not for price, nor for bribe, said Jehovah of Hosts.",

  "15": "Surely Thou [art] a God hiding Thyself, God of Israel -- Saviour!",
  "16": "They have been ashamed, And they have even blushed -- all of them, Together gone in confusion have those carving images.",
  "17": "Israel hath been saved in Jehovah, A salvation age-during! Ye are not ashamed nor confounded Unto the ages of eternity!",
  "18": "For thus said Jehovah, Creator of heaven, He is God, Former of earth, and its Maker, He established it -- not empty He prepared it, For inhabiting He formed it: `I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else.",

  "21": "Declare ye, and bring near, Yea, they take counsel together, Who hath proclaimed this from of old? From that time hath declared it? Is it not I -- Jehovah? And there is no other god besides Me, A God righteous and saving, there is none save Me.",
  "22": "Turn to Me, and be saved, all ends of the earth, For I [am] God, and there is none else.",
  "23": "By Myself I have sworn, Gone out from my mouth in righteousness hath a word, And it turneth not back, That to Me, bow doth every knee, every tongue swear.",
  "24": "Only in Jehovah, said hath one, Have I righteousness and strength, Unto Him he cometh in, And ashamed are all those displeased with Him.",
  "25": "In Jehovah are all the seed of Israel justified, And they boast themselves.`"
