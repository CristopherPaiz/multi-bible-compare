  "46": "And all the masters of the tower of Shechem hear, and go in unto the high place of the house of the god Berith,",
  "47": "and it is declared to Abimelech that all the masters of the tower of Shechem have gathered themselves together,",
  "48": "and Abimelech goeth up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people who [are] with him, and Abimelech taketh the great axe in his hand, and cutteth off a bough of the trees, and lifteth it up, and setteth [it] on his shoulder, and saith unto the people who [are] with him, `What ye have seen I have done -- haste, do ye like it.`",
  "49": "And all the people also cut down each one his bough, and go after Abimelech, and set [them] at the high place, and burn by these the high place with fire, and also all the men of the tower of Shechem die, about a thousand men and women.",

  "53": "and a certain woman doth cast a piece of a rider on the head of Abimelech, and breaketh his skull,",
  "54": "and he calleth hastily unto the young man bearing his weapons, and saith to him, `Draw thy sword, and thou hast put me to death, lest they say of me -- A woman slew him;` and his young man pierced him through, and he dieth.",
  "55": "And the men of Israel see that Abimelech [is] dead, and go each one to his place;",
  "56": "and God turneth back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father to slay his seventy brethren;",
  "57": "and all the evil of the men of Shechem hath God turned back on their head, and come unto them doth the cursing of Jotham son of Jerubbaal."
