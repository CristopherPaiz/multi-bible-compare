  "1": "And it cometh to pass, after [some] days, in the days of wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner chamber;` and her father hath not permitted him to go in,",
  "2": "and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her sister -- the young one -- better than she? Let her be, I pray thee, to thee, instead of her.`",
  "3": "And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.`",
  "4": "And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch between the two tails, in the midst,",
  "5": "and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth [them] out into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth [it] from heap even unto standing corn, even unto vineyard -- olive-yard.",
  "6": "And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?` And they say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;` and the Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.",
  "7": "And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!`",
  "8": "And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting, and goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.",
  "9": "And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are spread out in Lehi,",
  "10": "and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against us?` and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.`",
  "11": "And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the Philistines are rulers over us? and what [is] this thou hast done to us?` And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did to them.`",
  "12": "And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down -- to give thee into the hand of the Philistines.` And Samson saith to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.`",
  "13": "And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do not put thee to death;` and they bind him with two thick bands, new ones, and bring him up from the rock.",
  "14": "He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and the thick bands which [are] on his arms are as flax which they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his hands,",
  "15": "and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it -- a thousand men.",
  "16": "And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass -- an ass upon asses -- with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a thousand men.`",
  "17": "And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he casteth away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and calleth that place Ramath-Lehi;",
  "18": "and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.`",
  "19": "And God cleaveth the hollow place which [is] in Lehi, and waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh back, and he reviveth; therefore hath [one] called its name `The fountain of him who is calling,` which [is] in Lehi unto this day.",
  "20": "And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
