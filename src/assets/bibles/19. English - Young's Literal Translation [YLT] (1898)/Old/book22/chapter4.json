  "1": "Lo, thou [art] fair, my friend, lo, thou [art] fair, Thine eyes [are] doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,",
  "2": "Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.",
  "3": "As a thread of scarlet [are] thy lips, And thy speech [is] comely, As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind thy veil,",
  "4": "As the tower of David [is] thy neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty.",
  "5": "Thy two breasts [are] as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies.",
  "6": "Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the hill of frankincense.",
  "7": "Thou [art] all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not in thee. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,",
  "8": "Come from Lebanon, come thou in. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of lions, From the mountains of leopards.",
  "9": "Thou hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.",
  "10": "How wonderful have been thy loves, my sister-spouse, How much better have been thy loves than wine, And the fragrance of thy perfumes than all spices.",
  "11": "Thy lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk [are] under thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments [Is] as the fragrance of Lebanon.",
  "12": "A garden shut up [is] my sister-spouse, A spring shut up -- a fountain sealed.",
  "13": "Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious fruits,",
  "14": "Cypresses with nard -- nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.",
  "15": "A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings from Lebanon!",
  "16": "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!"
