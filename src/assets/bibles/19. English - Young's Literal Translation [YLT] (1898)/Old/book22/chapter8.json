  "1": "Who doth make thee as a brother to me, Sucking the breasts of my mother? I find thee without, I kiss thee, Yea, they do not despise me,",
  "2": "I lead thee, I bring thee in unto my mother`s house, She doth teach me, I cause thee to drink of the perfumed wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate,",
  "3": "His left hand [is] under my head, And his right doth embrace me.",
  "4": "I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, How ye stir up, And how ye wake the love till she please!",
  "5": "Who [is] this coming from the wilderness, Hasting herself for her beloved? Under the citron-tree I have waked thee, There did thy mother pledge thee, There she gave a pledge [that] bare thee.",
  "6": "Set me as a seal on thy heart, as a seal on thine arm, For strong as death is love, Sharp as Sheol is jealousy, Its burnings [are] burnings of fire, a flame of Jah!",
  "7": "Many waters are not able to quench the love, And floods do not wash it away. If one give all the wealth of his house for love, Treading down -- they tread upon it.",
  "8": "We have a little sister, and breasts she hath not, What do we do for our sister, In the day that it is told of her?",
  "9": "If she is a wall, we build by her a palace of silver. And if she is a door, We fashion by her board-work of cedar.",
  "10": "I [am] a wall, and my breasts as towers, Then I have been in his eyes as one finding peace.",

  "13": "The companions are attending to thy voice, Cause me to hear. Flee, my beloved, and be like to a roe,",
  "14": "Or to a young one of the harts on mountains of spices!"
