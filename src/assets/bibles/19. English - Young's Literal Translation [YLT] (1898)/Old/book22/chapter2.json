  "1": "As a lily among the thorns,",
  "2": "So [is] my friend among the daughters!",
  "3": "As a citron among trees of the forest, So [is] my beloved among the sons, In his shade I delighted, and sat down, And his fruit [is] sweet to my palate.",
  "4": "He hath brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner over me [is] love,",
  "5": "Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I [am] sick with love.",
  "6": "His left hand [is] under my head, And his right doth embrace me.",
  "7": "I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!",
  "8": "The voice of my beloved! lo, this -- he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.",
  "9": "My beloved [is] like to a roe, Or to a young one of the harts. Lo, this -- he is standing behind our wall, Looking from the windows, Blooming from the lattice.",
  "10": "My beloved hath answered and said to me, `Rise up, my friend, my fair one, and come away,",
  "11": "For lo, the winter hath passed by, The rain hath passed away -- it hath gone.",
  "12": "The flowers have appeared in the earth, The time of the singing hath come, And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land,",
  "13": "The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs, And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my friend, my fair one, yea, come away.",
  "14": "My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the ascent, Cause me to see thine appearance, Cause me to hear thy voice, For thy voice [is] sweet, and thy appearance comely.",
  "15": "Seize ye for us foxes, Little foxes -- destroyers of vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards.",
  "16": "My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his, Who is delighting among the lilies,",
  "17": "Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of the harts, On the mountains of separation!"
