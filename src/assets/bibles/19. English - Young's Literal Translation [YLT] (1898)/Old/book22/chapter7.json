  "1": "As the chorus of `Mahanaim.` How beautiful were thy feet with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of thy sides [are] as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.",
  "2": "Thy waist [is] a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,",
  "3": "Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,",
  "4": "Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of Lebanon looking to Damascus,",
  "5": "Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as purple, The king is bound with the flowings!",
  "6": "How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in delights.",
  "7": "This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts to clusters.",
  "8": "I said, `Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,",
  "9": "And thy palate as the good wine --` Flowing to my beloved in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!",
  "10": "I [am] my beloved`s, and on me [is] his desire.",
  "11": "Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,",
  "12": "We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to thee my loves;",
  "13": "The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!"
