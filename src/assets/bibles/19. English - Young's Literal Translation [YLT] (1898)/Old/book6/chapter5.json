  "1": "And it cometh to pass when all the kings of the Amorite which [are] beyond the Jordan, towards the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanite which [are] by the sea, hear how that Jehovah hath dried up the waters of the Jordan at the presence of the sons of Israel till their passing over, that their heart is melted, and there hath not been in them any more spirit because of the presence of the sons of Israel.",
  "2": "At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua, `Make for thee knives of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time;`",
  "3": "and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint, and circumciseth the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins.",
  "4": "And this [is] the thing [for] which Joshua circumciseth [them]: all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males, all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out of Egypt,",
  "5": "for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and all the people who [are] born in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised;",
  "6": "for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah hath sworn not to show them the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey, are consumed;",
  "7": "and their sons He raised up in their stead, them hath Joshua circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have not circumcised them in the way.",
  "8": "And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp till their recovering;",
  "9": "and Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `To-day I have rolled the reproach of Egypt from off you;` and [one] calleth the name of that place Gilgal unto this day.",
  "10": "And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho;",
  "11": "and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of the passover, unleavened things and roasted [corn], in this self-same day;",
  "12": "and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of the old corn of the land, and there hath been no more manna to the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of Canaan in that year.",
  "13": "And it cometh to pass in Joshua`s being by Jericho, that he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, one standing over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua goeth unto him, and saith to him, `Art thou for us or for our adversaries?`",
  "14": "And He saith, `No, for I [am] Prince of Jehovah`s host; now I have come;` and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and saith to Him, `What is my Lord speaking unto His servant?`",
  "15": "And the Prince of Jehovah`s host saith unto Joshua, `Cast off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou art standing is holy;` and Joshua doth so;"
