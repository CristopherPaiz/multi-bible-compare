  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. Only -- good to Israel [is] God, to the clean of heart. And I -- as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,",
  "2": "As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,",
  "3": "The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,",
  "4": "And their might [is] firm.",
  "5": "In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.",
  "6": "Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.",
  "7": "Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;",
  "8": "They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.",
  "9": "They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.",
  "10": "Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.",
  "11": "And they have said, `How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?`",
  "12": "Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.",
  "13": "Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,",
  "14": "And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every morning.",
  "15": "If I have said, `I recount thus,` Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.",
  "16": "And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine eyes,",
  "17": "Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.",
  "18": "Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.",
  "19": "How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended -- consumed from terrors.",
  "20": "As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.",
  "21": "For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,",
  "22": "And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.",
  "23": "And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.",
  "24": "With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.",
  "25": "Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.",
  "26": "Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion [is] God to the age.",
  "27": "For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.",
  "28": "And I -- nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!"
