  "1": "A Prayer of David. Hear, O Jehovah, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear [to] my prayer, without lips of deceit.",
  "2": "From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.",
  "3": "Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.",
  "4": "As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;",
  "5": "To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden.",
  "6": "I -- I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.",
  "7": "Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.",
  "8": "Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.",
  "9": "From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.",
  "10": "Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:",
  "11": "`Our steps now have compassed [him];` Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.",
  "12": "His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.",
  "13": "Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,",
  "14": "From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, their portion [is] in life, And [with] Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied [with] sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings.",
  "15": "I -- in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking, [with] Thy form!"
