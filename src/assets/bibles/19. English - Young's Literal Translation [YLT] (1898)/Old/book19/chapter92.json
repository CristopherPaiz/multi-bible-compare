  "1": "A Psalm. -- A Song for the sabbath-day. Good to give thanks to Jehovah, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High,",
  "2": "To declare in the morning Thy kindness, And Thy faithfulness in the nights.",
  "3": "On ten strings and on psaltery, On higgaion, with harp.",
  "4": "For Thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Jehovah, in Thy work, Concerning the works of Thy hands I sing.",
  "5": "How great have been Thy works, O Jehovah, Very deep have been Thy thoughts.",
  "6": "A brutish man doth not know, And a fool understandeth not this; --",
  "7": "When the wicked flourish as a herb, And blossom do all workers of iniquity -- For their being destroyed for ever and ever!",
  "8": "And Thou [art] high to the age, O Jehovah.",
  "9": "For, lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of iniquity.",

  "11": "And mine eye looketh on mine enemies, Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.",
  "12": "The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.",
  "13": "Those planted in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of our God do flourish.",
  "14": "Still they bring forth in old age, Fat and flourishing are they,",
  "15": "To declare that upright [is] Jehovah my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!"
