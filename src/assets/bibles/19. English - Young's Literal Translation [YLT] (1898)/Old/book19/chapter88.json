  "1": "A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah, to the Overseer, `Concerning the Sickness of Afflictions.` -- An instruction, by Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,",
  "2": "My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,",
  "3": "For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come to Sheol.",
  "4": "I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, I have been as a man without strength.",
  "5": "Among the dead -- free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand have been cut off.",
  "6": "Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.",
  "7": "Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And [with] all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.",
  "8": "Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up -- I go not forth.",
  "9": "Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.",
  "10": "To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.",
  "11": "Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?",
  "12": "Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?",
  "13": "And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.",
  "14": "Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.",
  "15": "I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Thy terrors -- I pine away.",
  "16": "Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me off,",
  "17": "They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,",
  "18": "Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!"
