  "3": "Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.",
  "4": "Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.",
  "5": "The righteous doth beat me [in] kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer [is] about their vexations.",

  "7": "As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.",
