  "1": "By David. Jehovah [is] my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah [is] the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid?",
  "2": "When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.",
  "3": "Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I [am] confident.",
  "4": "One [thing] I asked of Jehovah -- it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.",
  "5": "For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.",
  "6": "And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies -- my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.",
  "7": "Hear, O Jehovah, my voice -- I call, And favour me, and answer me.",
  "8": "To Thee said my heart `They sought my face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.`",
  "9": "Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.",
  "10": "When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.",
  "11": "Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.",
  "12": "Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.",
  "13": "I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!",
  "14": "Look unto Jehovah -- be strong, And He doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!"
