  "13": "Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.",
  "14": "Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,",
  "15": "And wine -- it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread -- the heart of man it supporteth.",

  "17": "Where birds do make nests, The stork -- the firs [are] her house.",

  "26": "There do ships go: leviathan, That Thou hast formed to play in it.",
  "27": "All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.",
  "28": "Thou dost give to them -- they gather, Thou dost open Thy hand -- they [are] satisfied [with] good.",
  "29": "Thou hidest Thy face -- they are troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit -- they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.",
