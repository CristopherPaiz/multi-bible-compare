  "1": "A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou [art] my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters.",
  "2": "So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour.",
  "3": "Because better [is] Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee.",
  "4": "So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands.",
  "5": "As [with] milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And [with] singing lips doth my mouth praise.",
  "6": "If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches -- I meditate on Thee.",
  "7": "For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing.",
  "8": "Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold.",
  "9": "And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.",
  "10": "They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.",
  "11": "And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!"
