  "1": "Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,",
  "2": "Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.",
  "3": "Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.",
  "4": "The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. `God is not!` [are] all his devices.",
  "5": "Pain do his ways at all times, On high [are] Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.",
  "6": "He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,` To generation and generation not in evil.",
  "7": "Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,",
  "8": "He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,",
  "9": "He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.",
  "10": "He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.",
  "11": "He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.`",
  "12": "Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.",
  "13": "Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, `It is not required.`",
  "14": "Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave [it], Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.",
  "15": "Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;",
  "16": "Jehovah [is] king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!",
  "17": "The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,",
  "18": "To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!"
