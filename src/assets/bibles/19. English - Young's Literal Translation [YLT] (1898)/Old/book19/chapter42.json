  "1": "To the Overseer. -- An Instruction. By sons of Korah. As a hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward Thee, O God.",
  "2": "My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I enter and see the face of God?",
  "3": "My tear hath been to me bread day and night, In their saying unto me all the day, `Where [is] thy God?`",
  "4": "These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping feast!",
  "5": "What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? Yea, art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The salvation of my countenance -- My God!",
  "6": "In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.",
  "7": "Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me.",
  "8": "By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness, And by night a song [is] with me, A prayer to the God of my life.",
  "9": "I say to God my rock, `Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?",
  "10": "With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, `Where [is] thy God?`",
  "11": "What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!"
