  "1": "To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. I have diligently expected Jehovah, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my cry,",
  "2": "And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation -- from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is establishing my steps.",
  "3": "And He putteth in my mouth a new song, `Praise to our God.` Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah.",
  "4": "O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust, And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to lies.",
  "5": "Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy wonders and Thy thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.",
  "6": "Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired, Ears Thou hast prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou hast not asked.",
  "7": "Then said I, `Lo, I have come,` In the roll of the book it is written of me,",
  "8": "To do Thy pleasure, my God, I have delighted, And Thy law [is] within my heart.",
  "9": "I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great assembly, lo, my lips I restrain not, O Jehovah, Thou hast known.",
  "10": "Thy righteousness I have not concealed In the midst of my heart, Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation I have told, I have not hidden Thy kindness and Thy truth, To the great assembly.",
  "11": "Thou, O Jehovah, restrainest not Thy mercies from me, Thy kindness and Thy truth do continually keep me.",
  "12": "For compassed me have evils innumerable, Overtaken me have mine iniquities, And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart hath forsaken me.",
  "13": "Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help make haste.",
  "14": "They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, They are turned backward, And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.",
  "15": "They are desolate because of their shame, Who are saying to me, `Aha, aha.`",
  "16": "All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee, Those loving Thy salvation say continually, `Jehovah is magnified.`",
  "17": "And I [am] poor and needy, The Lord doth devise for me. My help and my deliverer [art] Thou, O my God, tarry Thou not."
