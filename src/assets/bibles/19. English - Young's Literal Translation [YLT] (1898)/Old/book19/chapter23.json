  "1": "A Psalm of David. Jehovah [is] my shepherd, I do not lack,",
  "2": "In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.",
  "3": "My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name`s sake,",
  "4": "Also -- when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou [art] with me, Thy rod and Thy staff -- they comfort me.",
  "5": "Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!",
  "6": "Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling [is] in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!"
