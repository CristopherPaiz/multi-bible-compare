  "1": "By David. Blessed [is] Jehovah my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.",
  "2": "My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!",
  "3": "Jehovah, what [is] man that Thou knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?",
  "4": "Man to vanity hath been like, His days [are] as a shadow passing by.",
  "5": "Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.",
  "6": "Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,",
  "7": "Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,",
  "8": "Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.",
  "9": "O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.",
  "10": "Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.",

  "14": "Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.",
  "15": "O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God [is] Jehovah!"
