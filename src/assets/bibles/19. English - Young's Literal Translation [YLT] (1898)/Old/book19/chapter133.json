  "1": "A Song of the Ascents, by David. Lo, how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren -- even together!",
  "2": "As the good oil on the head, Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That cometh down on the skirt of his robes,",
  "3": "As dew of Hermon -- That cometh down on hills of Zion, For there Jehovah commanded the blessing -- Life unto the age!"
