  "2": "For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.",
  "3": "Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?",
  "4": "The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.",
  "5": "He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.",
  "6": "This [is] a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.",
  "7": "Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!",
  "8": "Who [is] this -- `the king of glory?` Jehovah -- strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.",
  "9": "Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!",
  "10": "Who [is] He -- this `king of glory?` Jehovah of hosts -- He [is] the king of glory! Selah."
