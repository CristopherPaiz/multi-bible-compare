  "1": "A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. If Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.",
  "2": "Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved one sleep.",
  "3": "Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah [are] sons, A reward [is] the fruit of the womb.",
  "4": "As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So [are] the sons of the young men.",
  "5": "O the happiness of the man Who hath filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!"
