  "33": "And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble.",
  "34": "If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,",
  "35": "And they remember that God [is] their rock, And God Most High their redeemer.",
  "36": "And -- they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,",
  "37": "And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.",
  "38": "And He -- the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury.",

  "42": "They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.",
  "43": "When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,",
  "44": "And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not.",

  "51": "And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.",
  "52": "And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,",
  "53": "And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.",
  "54": "And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,",
  "55": "And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,",
  "56": "And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept.",
  "57": "And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,",
  "58": "And make Him angry with their high places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,",

  "69": "And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.",
  "70": "And He fixeth on David His servant, And taketh him from the folds of a flock,",
  "71": "From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.",
