  "1": "To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of David. I have said, `I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked [is] before me.`",
  "2": "I was dumb [with] silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.",
  "3": "Hot [is] my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.",
  "4": "`Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of my days -- what it [is],` I know how frail I [am].",
  "5": "Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age [is] as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity [is] every man set up. Selah.",
  "6": "Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, [in] vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them.",
  "7": "And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope -- it [is] of Thee.",
  "8": "From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not.",
  "9": "I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou -- Thou hast done [it].",
  "10": "Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed.",
  "11": "With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity [is] every man. Selah.",
  "12": "Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And [to] my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I [am] with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.",
  "13": "Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!"
