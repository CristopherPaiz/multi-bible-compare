  "1": "By David. Strive, Jehovah, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,",
  "2": "Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,",
  "3": "And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, `Thy salvation I [am].`",
  "4": "They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.",
  "5": "They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah driving away.",
  "6": "Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.",
  "7": "For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.",
  "8": "Meet him doth desolation -- he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.",
  "9": "And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His salvation.",
  "10": "All my bones say, `Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.`",
  "11": "Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.",
  "12": "They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,",
  "13": "And I -- in their sickness my clothing [is] sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.",
  "14": "As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.",
  "15": "And -- in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;",
  "16": "With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.",
  "17": "Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.",
  "18": "I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.",
  "19": "Mine enemies rejoice not over me [with] falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.",
  "20": "For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,",
  "21": "And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, `Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.`",
  "22": "Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord -- be not far from me,",
  "23": "Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.",
  "24": "Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.",
  "25": "They do not say in their heart, `Aha, our desire.` They do not say, `We swallowed him up.`",
  "26": "They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.",
  "27": "They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, `Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.`",
  "28": "And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!"
