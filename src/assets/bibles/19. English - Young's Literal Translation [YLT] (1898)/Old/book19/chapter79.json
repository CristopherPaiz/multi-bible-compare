  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have come into Thy inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made Jerusalem become heaps,",
  "2": "They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild beast of the earth.",
  "3": "They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.",
  "4": "We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.",
  "5": "Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy doth burn as fire.",
  "6": "Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.",
  "7": "For [one] hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have made desolate.",
  "8": "Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste, let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.",
  "9": "Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy name`s sake.",
  "10": "Why do the nations say, `Where [is] their God?` Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the blood of Thy servants that is shed.",
  "11": "Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of death.",
  "12": "And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.",
  "13": "And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy praise!"
