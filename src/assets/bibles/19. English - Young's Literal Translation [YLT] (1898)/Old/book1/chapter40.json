  "1": "And it cometh to pass, after these things -- the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt;",

  "17": "and in the uppermost basket [are] of all [kinds] of Pharaoh`s food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them out of the basket, from off my head.`",
  "18": "And Joseph answereth and saith, `This [is] its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;",
