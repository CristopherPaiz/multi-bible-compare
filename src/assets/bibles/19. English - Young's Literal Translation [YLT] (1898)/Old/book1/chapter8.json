  "1": "And God remembereth Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle which [are] with him in the ark, and God causeth a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside,",
  "2": "and closed are the fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens, and restrained is the shower from the heavens.",
  "3": "And turn back do the waters from off the earth, going on and returning; and the waters are lacking at the end of a hundred and fifty days.",
  "4": "And the ark resteth, in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat;",
  "5": "and the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth [month], on the first of the month, appeared the heads of the mountains.",
  "6": "And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah openeth the window of the ark which he made,",
  "7": "and he sendeth forth the raven, and it goeth out, going out and turning back till the drying of the waters from off the earth.",
  "8": "And he sendeth forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground,",
  "9": "and the dove hath not found rest for the sole of her foot, and she turneth back unto him, unto the ark, for waters [are] on the face of all the earth, and he putteth out his hand, and taketh her, and bringeth her in unto him, unto the ark.",
  "10": "And he stayeth yet other seven days, and addeth to send forth the dove from the ark;",
  "11": "and the dove cometh in unto him at even-time, and lo, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth; and Noah knoweth that the waters have been lightened from off the earth.",
  "12": "And he stayeth yet other seven days, and sendeth forth the dove, and it added not to turn back unto him any more.",
  "13": "And it cometh to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], in the first of the month, the waters have been dried from off the earth; and Noah turneth aside the covering of the ark, and looketh, and lo, the face of the ground hath been dried.",
  "14": "And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth hath become dry.",
  "15": "And God speaketh unto Noah, saying, `Go out from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons` wives with thee;",
  "16": "every living thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, among fowl, and among cattle, and among every creeping thing which is creeping on the earth, bring out with thee;",
  "17": "and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied on the earth.`",
  "18": "And Noah goeth out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons` wives with him;",
  "19": "every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl; every creeping thing on the earth, after their families, have gone out from the ark.",
  "20": "And Noah buildeth an altar to Jehovah, and taketh of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and causeth burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar;",
  "21": "and Jehovah smelleth the sweet fragrance, and Jehovah saith unto His heart, `I continue not to disesteem any more the ground because of man, though the imagination of the heart of man [is] evil from his youth; and I continue not to smite any more all living, as I have done;",
  "22": "during all days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, do not cease.`"
