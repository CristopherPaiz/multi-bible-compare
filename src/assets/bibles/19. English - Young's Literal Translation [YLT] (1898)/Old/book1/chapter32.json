  "1": "And Jacob hath gone on his way, and messengers of God come upon him;",
  "2": "and Jacob saith, when he hath seen them, `This [is] the camp of God;` and he calleth the name of that place `Two Camps.`",
  "3": "And Jacob sendeth messengers before him unto Esau his brother, towards the land of Seir, the field of Edom,",
  "4": "and commandeth them, saying, `Thus do ye say to my lord, to Esau: Thus said thy servant Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned, and I tarry until now;",
  "5": "and I have ox, and ass, flock, and man-servant, and maid-servant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace in his eyes.`",
  "6": "And the messengers turn back unto Jacob, saying, `We came in unto thy brother, unto Esau, and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him;`",
  "7": "and Jacob feareth exceedingly, and is distressed, and he divideth the people who [are] with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps,",
  "8": "and saith, `If Esau come in unto the one camp, and have smitten it -- then the camp which is left hath been for an escape.`",
  "9": "And Jacob saith, `God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who saith unto me, Turn back to thy land, and to thy kindred, and I do good with thee:",
  "10": "I have been unworthy of all the kind acts, and of all the truth which Thou hast done with thy servant -- for, with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.",
  "11": "`Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, less he come and have smitten me -- mother beside sons;",
  "12": "and Thou -- Thou hast said, I certainly do good with thee, and have set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered because of the multitude.`",
  "13": "And he lodgeth there during that night, and taketh from that which is coming into his hand, a present for Esau his brother:",
  "14": "she-goats two hundred, and he-goats twenty, ewes two hundred, and rams twenty,",
  "15": "suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty, and bullocks ten, she-asses twenty, and foals ten;",
  "16": "and he giveth into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and saith unto his servants, `Pass over before me, and a space ye do put between drove and drove.`",
  "17": "And he commandeth the first, saying, `When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and hath asked thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?",
  "18": "then thou hast said, Thy servant Jacob`s: it [is] a present sent to my lord, to Esau; and lo, he also [is] behind us.`",
  "19": "And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also all who are going after the droves, saying, `According to this manner do ye speak unto Esau in your finding him,",
  "20": "and ye have said also, Lo, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us;` for he said, `I pacify his face with the present which is going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he lifteth up my face;`",
  "21": "and the present passeth over before his face, and he hath lodged during that night in the camp.",
  "22": "And he riseth in that night, and taketh his two wives, and his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth over the passage of Jabbok;",
  "23": "and he taketh them, and causeth them to pass over the brook, and he causeth that which he hath to pass over.",
  "24": "And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till the ascending of the dawn;",
  "25": "and he seeth that he is not able for him, and he cometh against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob`s thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him;",
  "26": "and he saith, `Send me away, for the dawn hath ascended:` and he saith, `I send thee not away, except thou hast blessed me.`",
  "27": "And he saith unto him, `What [is] thy name?` and he saith, `Jacob.`",
  "28": "And he saith, `Thy name is no more called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast been a prince with God and with men, and dost prevail.`",
  "29": "And Jacob asketh, and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, thy name;` and he saith, `Why [is] this, thou askest for My name?` and He blesseth him there.",
  "30": "And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for `I have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;`",
  "31": "and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel, and he is halting on his thigh;",
  "32": "therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank, which [is] on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because He came against the hollow of Jacob`s thigh, against the sinew which shrank."
