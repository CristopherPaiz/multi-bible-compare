  "1": "I said in my heart, `Pray, come, I try thee with mirth, and look thou on gladness;` and lo, even it [is] vanity.",
  "2": "Of laughter I said, `Foolish!` and of mirth, `What [is] this it is doing?`",
  "3": "I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite, (and my heart leading in wisdom), and to take hold on folly till that I see where [is] this -- the good to the sons of man of that which they do under the heavens, the number of the days of their lives.",
  "4": "I made great my works, I builded for me houses, I planted for me vineyards.",
  "5": "I made for me gardens and paradises, and I planted in them trees of every fruit.",
  "6": "I made for me pools of water, to water from them a forest shooting forth trees.",
  "7": "I got men-servants, and maid-servants, and sons of the house were to me; also, I had much substance -- herd and flock -- above all who had been before me in Jerusalem.",
  "8": "I gathered for me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. I prepared for me men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of man -- a wife and wives.",
  "9": "And I became great, and increased above every one who had been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me.",
  "10": "And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from all my labour,",
  "11": "and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done, and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole [is] vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun!",
  "12": "And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but what [is] the man who cometh after the king? that which [is] already -- they have done it!",
  "13": "And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom above folly, like the advantage of the light above the darkness.",
  "14": "The wise! -- his eyes [are] in his head, and the fool in darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth with them all;",
  "15": "and I said in my heart, `As it happeneth with the fool, it happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?` And I spake in my heart, that also this [is] vanity:",
  "16": "That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool -- to the age, for that which [is] already, [in] the days that are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the fool!",
  "17": "And I have hated life, for sad to me [is] the work that hath been done under the sun, for the whole [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.",
  "18": "And I have hated all my labour that I labour at under the sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me.",
  "19": "And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I have done wisely under the sun! this also [is] vanity.",
  "20": "And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour that I laboured at under the sun.",
  "21": "For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured therein he giveth it -- his portion! Even this [is] vanity and a great evil.",
  "22": "For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun?",
  "23": "For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even at night his heart hath not lain down; this also [is] vanity.",
  "24": "There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk, and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have seen that it [is] from the hand of God.",
  "25": "For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?",
  "26": "For to a man who [is] good before Him, He hath given wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before God. Even this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit."
