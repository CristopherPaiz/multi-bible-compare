  "1": "In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free -- stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;",
  "2": "lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;",
  "3": "and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;",
  "4": "ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;",
  "5": "for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,",
  "6": "for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.",
  "7": "Ye were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?",
  "8": "the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you!",
  "9": "a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;",
  "10": "I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.",
  "11": "And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;",
  "12": "O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!",
  "13": "For ye -- to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,",
  "14": "for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;`",
  "15": "and if one another ye do bite and devour, see -- that ye may not by one another be consumed.",
  "16": "And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;",
  "17": "for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will -- these ye may not do;",
  "18": "and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.",
  "19": "And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",
  "20": "idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,",
  "21": "envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.",
  "22": "And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,",
  "23": "meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;",
  "24": "and those who are Christ`s, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;",
  "25": "if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;",
  "26": "let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking, one another envying!"
