  "1": "Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who [are] spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself -- lest thou also may be tempted;",
  "2": "of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,",
  "3": "for if any one doth think [himself] to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive;",
  "4": "and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,",
  "5": "for each one his own burden shall bear.",
  "6": "And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things.",
  "7": "Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,",
  "8": "because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;",
  "9": "and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;",
  "10": "therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.",
  "11": "Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;",
  "12": "as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,",
  "13": "for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.",
  "14": "And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;",
  "15": "for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;",
  "16": "and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!",
  "17": "Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.",
  "18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit, brethren! Amen."
