  "1": "And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,",
  "2": "but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,",
  "3": "so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,",
  "4": "and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,",
  "5": "that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;",
  "6": "and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, `Abba, Father!`",
  "7": "so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.",
  "8": "But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods,",
  "9": "and now, having known God -- and rather being known by God -- how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude?",
  "10": "days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!",
  "11": "I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.",
  "12": "Become as I [am] -- because I also [am] as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,",
  "13": "and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,",
  "14": "and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me -- as Christ Jesus;",
  "15": "what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me;",
  "16": "so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?",
  "17": "they are zealous for you -- [yet] not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;",
  "18": "and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;",
  "19": "my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,",
  "20": "and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.",
  "21": "Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear?",
  "22": "for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,",
  "23": "but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the promise;",
  "24": "which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;",
  "25": "for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude with her children,",
  "26": "and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,",
  "27": "for it hath been written, `Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many [are] the children of the desolate -- more than of her having the husband.`",
  "28": "And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,",
  "29": "but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;",
  "30": "but what saith the Writing? `Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;`",
  "31": "then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant`s children, but the free-woman`s."
