  "1": "My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "2": "for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment,",
  "3": "and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, `Thou -- sit thou here well,` and to the poor man may say, `Thou -- stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool,` --",
  "4": "ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges.",
  "5": "Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him?",
  "6": "and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;",
  "7": "do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?",
  "8": "If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing, `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,` -- ye do well;",
  "9": "and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors;",
  "10": "for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one [point], he hath become guilty of all;",
  "11": "for He who is saying, `Thou mayest not commit adultery,` said also, `Thou mayest do no murder;` and if thou shalt not commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law;",
  "12": "so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged,",
  "13": "for the judgment without kindness [is] to him not having done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment.",
  "14": "What [is] the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able to save him?",
  "15": "and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food,",
  "16": "and any one of you may say to them, `Depart ye in peace, be warmed, and be filled,` and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what [is] the profit?",
  "17": "so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself.",
  "18": "But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works, shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of my works my faith:",
  "19": "thou -- thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!",
  "20": "And dost thou wish to know, O vain man, that the faith apart from the works is dead?",
  "21": "Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?",
  "22": "dost thou see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?",
  "23": "and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, `And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;` and, `Friend of God` he was called.",
  "24": "Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only;",
  "25": "and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth?",
  "26": "for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead."
