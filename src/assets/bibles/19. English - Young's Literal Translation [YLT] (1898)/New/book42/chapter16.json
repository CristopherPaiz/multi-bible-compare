  "3": "`And the steward said in himself, What shall I do, because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed: --",
  "4": "I have known what I shall do, that, when I may be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses.",
  "5": "`And having called near each one of his lord`s debtors, he said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord?",
  "6": "and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and he said to him, Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty.",
  "7": "`Afterward to another he said, And thou, how much dost thou owe? and he said, A hundred cors of wheat; and he saith to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.",
  "8": "`And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did prudently, because the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of the light, in respect to their generation.",
  "9": "and I say to you, Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye may fail, they may receive you to the age-during tabernacles.",
  "10": "`He who is faithful in the least, [is] also faithful in much; and he who in the least [is] unrighteous, is also unrighteous in much;",
  "11": "if, then, in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful -- the true who will entrust to you?",
  "12": "and if in the other`s ye became not faithful -- your own, who shall give to you?",

  "14": "And also the Pharisees, being lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and were deriding him,",
  "15": "and he said to them, `Ye are those declaring yourselves righteous before men, but God doth know your hearts; because that which among men is high, [is] abomination before God;",
  "16": "the law and the prophets [are] till John; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news, and every one doth press into it;",
  "17": "and it is easier to the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one tittle to fall.",

  "19": "`And -- a certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, making merry sumptuously every day,",
  "20": "and there was a certain poor man, by name Lazarus, who was laid at his porch, full of sores,",
  "21": "and desiring to be filled from the crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man; yea, also the dogs, coming, were licking his sores.",
