  "1": "And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh, that is called Passover,",
  "2": "and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.",
  "3": "And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,",
  "4": "and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,",
  "5": "and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,",
  "6": "and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.",
  "7": "And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,",
  "8": "and he sent Peter and John, saying, `Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;`",
  "9": "and they said to him, `Where wilt thou that we might prepare?`",
  "10": "And he said to them, `Lo, in your entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,",
  "11": "and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat?",
  "12": "and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there make ready;`",
  "13": "and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.",
  "14": "And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the twelve apostles with him,",
  "15": "and he said unto them, `With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,",
  "16": "for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.`",
  "17": "And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said, `Take this and divide to yourselves,",
  "18": "for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.`",
  "19": "And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, `This is my body, that for you is being given, this do ye -- to remembrance of me.`",
  "20": "In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying, `This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, that for you is being poured forth.",
  "21": "`But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up [is] with me on the table,",
  "22": "and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but wo to that man through whom he is being delivered up.`",
  "23": "And they began to reason among themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.",
  "24": "And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them is accounted to be greater.",
  "25": "And he said to them, `The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors;",
  "26": "but ye [are] not so, but he who is greater among you -- let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is ministering;",
  "27": "for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering.",
  "28": "`And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations,",
  "29": "and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,",
  "30": "that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.`",
  "31": "And the Lord said, `Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,",
  "32": "and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.`",
  "33": "And he said to him, `Sir, with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go;`",
  "34": "and he said, `I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.`",
  "35": "And he said to them, `When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?` and they said, `Nothing.`",
  "36": "Then said he to them, `But, now, he who is having a bag, let him take [it] up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,",
  "37": "for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.`",
  "38": "And they said, `Sir, lo, here [are] two swords;` and he said to them, `It is sufficient.`",
  "39": "And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,",
  "40": "and having come to the place, he said to them, `Pray ye not to enter into temptation.`",
  "41": "And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone`s cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,",
  "42": "saying, `Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me --; but, not my will, but Thine be done.` --",
  "43": "And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;",
  "44": "and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.",
  "45": "And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,",
  "46": "and he said to them, `Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.`",
  "47": "And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,",
  "48": "and Jesus said to him, `Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?`",
  "49": "And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, `Sir, shall we smite with a sword?`",
  "50": "And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,",
  "51": "and Jesus answering said, `Suffer ye thus far,` and having touched his ear, he healed him.",
  "52": "And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders -- `As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?",
  "53": "while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.`",
  "54": "And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,",
  "55": "and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,",
  "56": "and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, `And this one was with him!`",
  "57": "and he disowned him, saying, `Woman, I have not known him.`",
  "58": "And after a little, another having seen him, said, `And thou art of them!` and Peter said, `Man, I am not.`",
  "59": "And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, `Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;`",
  "60": "and Peter said, `Man, I have not known what thou sayest;` and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.",
  "61": "And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him -- `Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;`",
  "62": "and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.",
  "63": "And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating [him];",
  "64": "and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, `Prophesy who he is who smote thee?`",
  "65": "and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.",
  "66": "And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,",
  "67": "saying, `If thou be the Christ, tell us.` And he said to them, `If I may tell you, ye will not believe;",
  "68": "and if I also question [you], ye will not answer me or send me away;",
  "69": "henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.`",
  "70": "And they all said, `Thou, then, art the Son of God?` and he said unto them, `Ye say [it], because I am;`",
  "71": "and they said, `What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear [it] from his mouth.`"
