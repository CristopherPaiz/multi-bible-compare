  "1": "And having risen, the whole multitude of them did lead him to Pilate,",
  "2": "and began to accuse him, saying, `This one we found perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.`",
  "3": "And Pilate questioned him, saying, `Thou art the king of the Jews?` and he answering him, said, `Thou dost say [it].`",
  "4": "And Pilate said unto the chief priests, and the multitude, `I find no fault in this man;`",
  "5": "and they were the more urgent, saying -- `He doth stir up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having begun from Galilee -- unto this place.`",
  "6": "And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man is a Galilean,",
  "7": "and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in Jerusalem in those days.",
  "8": "And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly, for he was wishing for a long [time] to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see done by him,",
  "9": "and was questioning him in many words, and he answered him nothing.",
  "10": "And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,",
  "11": "and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did send him back to Pilate,",
  "12": "and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity between themselves.",
  "13": "And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,",
  "14": "said unto them, `Ye brought to me this man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him;",
  "15": "no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;",
  "16": "having chastised, therefore, I will release him,`",
  "17": "for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast,",
  "18": "and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying, `Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas,`",
  "19": "who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.",
  "20": "Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them,",
  "21": "but they were calling out, saying, `Crucify, crucify him.`",
  "22": "And he a third time said unto them, `Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him, then, I will release [him].`",
  "23": "And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests, were prevailing,",
  "24": "and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,",
  "25": "and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.",
  "26": "And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the cross, to bear [it] behind Jesus.",
  "27": "And there was following him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and lamenting him,",
  "28": "and Jesus having turned unto them, said, `Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep ye, and for your children;",
  "29": "for, lo, days do come, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that did not give suck;",
  "30": "then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us; --",
  "31": "for, if in the green tree they do these things -- in the dry what may happen?`",
  "32": "And there were also others -- two evil-doers -- with him, to be put to death;",
  "33": "and when they came to the place that is called Skull, there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the right hand and one on the left.",
  "34": "And Jesus said, `Father, forgive them, for they have not known what they do;` and parting his garments they cast a lot.",
  "35": "And the people were standing, looking on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, `Others he saved, let him save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of God.`",
  "36": "And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and offering vinegar to him,",
  "37": "and saying, `If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.`",
  "38": "And there was also a superscription written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, `This is the King of the Jews.`",
  "39": "And one of the evil-doers who were hanged, was speaking evil of him, saying, `If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.`",
  "40": "And the other answering, was rebuking him, saying, `Dost thou not even fear God, that thou art in the same judgment?",
  "41": "and we indeed righteously, for things worthy of what we did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of place;`",
  "42": "and he said to Jesus, `Remember me, lord, when thou mayest come in thy reign;`",
  "43": "and Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, To-day with me thou shalt be in the paradise.`",
  "44": "And it was, as it were, the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour,",
  "45": "and the sun was darkened, and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst,",
  "46": "and having cried with a loud voice, Jesus said, `Father, to Thy hands I commit my spirit;` and these things having said, he breathed forth the spirit.",
  "47": "And the centurion having seen what was done, did glorify God, saying, `Really this man was righteous;`",
  "48": "and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts did turn back;",
  "49": "and all his acquaintances stood afar off, and women who did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.",
  "50": "And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a counsellor, a man good and righteous,",
  "51": "-- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was expecting the reign of God,",
  "52": "he, having gone near to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus,",
  "53": "and having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet laid.",
  "54": "And the day was a preparation, and sabbath was approaching,",
  "55": "and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his body was placed,",
  "56": "and having turned back, they made ready spices and ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according to the command."
