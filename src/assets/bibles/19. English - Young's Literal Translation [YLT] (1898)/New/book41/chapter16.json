  "1": "And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him,",
  "2": "and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,",
  "3": "and they said among themselves, `Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?`",
  "4": "And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled away -- for it was very great,",
  "5": "and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.",
  "6": "And he saith to them, `Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!",
  "7": "and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to you.`",
  "8": "And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.",

  "10": "she having gone, told those who had been with him, mourning and weeping;",
  "11": "and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.",

  "13": "and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did they believe.",
  "14": "Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;",
  "15": "and he said to them, `Having gone to all the world, proclaim the good news to all the creation;",
  "16": "he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.",
  "17": "`And signs shall accompany those believing these things; in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they shall speak;",
  "18": "serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall lay hands, and they shall be well.`",
  "19": "The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;",
  "20": "and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word, through the signs following. Amen."
