  "1": "And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered [him] to Pilate;",
  "2": "and Pilate questioned him, `Art thou the king of the Jews?` and he answering said to him, `Thou dost say [it].`",
  "3": "And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, [but he answered nothing.]",
  "4": "And Pilate again questioned him, saying, `Thou dost not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against thee!`",
  "5": "and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.",
  "6": "And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;",
  "7": "and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.",
  "8": "And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,",
  "9": "and Pilate answered them, saying, `Will ye [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?`",
  "10": "for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;",
  "11": "and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.",
  "12": "And Pilate answering, again said to them, `What, then, will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?`",
  "13": "and they again cried out, `Crucify him.`",
  "14": "And Pilate said to them, `Why -- what evil did he?` and they cried out the more vehemently, `Crucify him;`",
  "15": "and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged [him] -- that he might be crucified.",
  "16": "And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,",
  "17": "and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put [it] on him,",
  "18": "and began to salute him, `Hail, King of the Jews.`",
  "19": "And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,",
  "20": "and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.",
  "21": "And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,",
  "22": "and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, `Place of a skull;`",
  "23": "and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.",
  "24": "And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;",
  "25": "and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;",
  "26": "and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- `The King of the Jews.`",
  "27": "And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,",
  "28": "and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, `And with lawless ones he was numbered.`",
  "29": "And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, `Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!",
  "30": "save thyself, and come down from the cross!`",
  "31": "And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, `Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.",
  "32": "The Christ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;` and those crucified with him were reproaching him.",
  "33": "And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,",
  "34": "and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, `Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?` which is, being interpreted, `My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?`",
  "35": "And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, `Lo, Elijah he doth call;`",
  "36": "and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down.`",
  "37": "And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,",
  "38": "and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,",
  "39": "and the centurion who was standing over-against him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, `Truly this man was Son of God.`",
  "40": "And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,",
  "41": "(who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.",
  "42": "And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,",
  "43": "Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.",
  "44": "And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,",
  "45": "and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.",
  "46": "And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,",
  "47": "and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid."
