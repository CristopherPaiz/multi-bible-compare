  "8": "And immediately Jesus, having known in his spirit that they thus reason in themselves, said to them, `Why these things reason ye in your hearts?",
  "9": "which is easier, to say to the paralytic, The sins have been forgiven to thee? or to say, Rise, and take up thy couch, and walk?",
  "10": "`And, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on the earth to forgive sins -- (he saith to the paralytic) --",
  "11": "I say to thee, Rise, and take up thy couch, and go away to thy house;`",

  "18": "And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting, and they come and say to him, `Wherefore do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples do not fast?`",
  "19": "And Jesus said to them, `Are the sons of the bride-chamber able, while the bridegroom is with them, to fast? so long time as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast;",
