  "4": "and there were certain much displeased within themselves, and saying, `For what hath this waste of the ointment been made?",
  "5": "for this could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries, and given to the poor;` and they were murmuring at her.",
  "6": "And Jesus said, `Let her alone; why are ye giving her trouble? a good work she wrought on me;",
  "7": "for the poor always ye have with you, and whenever ye may will ye are able to do them good, but me ye have not always;",
  "8": "what she could she did, she anticipated to anoint my body for the embalming.",

  "12": "And the first day of the unleavened food, when they were killing the passover, his disciples say to him, `Where wilt thou, [that,] having gone, we may prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover?`",
  "13": "And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to them, `Go ye away to the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water, follow him;",
  "14": "and wherever he may go in, say ye to the master of the house -- The Teacher saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where the passover, with my disciples, I may eat?",
  "15": "and he will shew you a large upper room, furnished, prepared -- there make ready for us.`",
  "16": "And his disciples went forth, and came to the city, and found as he said to them, and they made ready the passover.",
  "17": "And evening having come, he cometh with the twelve,",
  "18": "and as they are reclining, and eating, Jesus said, `Verily I say to you -- one of you, who is eating with me -- shall deliver me up.`",
  "19": "And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him, one by one, `Is it I?` and another, `Is it I?`",

  "38": "Watch ye and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.`",

  "42": "rise, we may go, lo, he who is delivering me up hath come nigh.`",
  "43": "And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;",
  "44": "and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them, saying, `Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him, and lead him away safely,`",
  "45": "and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he saith, `Rabbi, Rabbi,` and kissed him.",
  "46": "And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;",
  "47": "and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear.",
  "48": "And Jesus answering said to them, `As against a robber ye came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!",
  "49": "daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.`",
  "50": "And having left him they all fled;",

  "55": "And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were not finding,",
  "56": "for many were bearing false testimony against him, and their testimonies were not alike.",
  "57": "And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying --",
  "58": "`We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands I will build;`",
  "59": "and neither so was their testimony alike.",
  "60": "And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst, questioned Jesus, saying, `Thou dost not answer anything! what do these testify against thee?`",
  "61": "and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and saith to him, `Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?`",
  "62": "and Jesus said, `I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the clouds, of the heaven.`",
  "63": "And the chief priest, having rent his garments, saith, `What need have we yet of witnesses?",
  "64": "Ye heard the evil speaking, what appeareth to you?` and they all condemned him to be worthy of death,",
  "65": "and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, `Prophesy;` and the officers were striking him with their palms.",
  "66": "And Peter being in the hall beneath, there doth come one of the maids of the chief priest,",
  "67": "and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on him, she said, `And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth!`",
  "68": "and he denied, saying, `I have not known [him], neither do I understand what thou sayest;` and he went forth without to the porch, and a cock crew.",
  "69": "And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those standing near -- `This is of them;`",
  "70": "and he was again denying. And after a little again, those standing near said to Peter, `Truly thou art of them, for thou also art a Galilean, and thy speech is alike;`",
  "71": "and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- `I have not known this man of whom ye speak;`",
  "72": "and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- `Before a cock crow twice, thou mayest deny me thrice;` and having thought thereon -- he was weeping."
