  "1": "To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
  "2": "I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago -- whether in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have not known, God hath known -- such an one being caught away unto the third heaven;",
  "3": "and I have known such a man -- whether in the body, whether out of the body, I have not known, God hath known, --",
  "4": "that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak.",
  "5": "Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities,",
  "6": "for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear anything of me;",
  "7": "and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted overmuch.",
  "8": "Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that it might depart from me,",
  "9": "and He said to me, `Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My power in infirmity is perfected;` most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may rest on me:",
  "10": "wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses -- for Christ; for whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;",
  "11": "I have become a fool -- boasting; ye -- ye did compel me; for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles -- even if I am nothing.",
  "12": "The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds,",
  "13": "for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this injustice!",
  "14": "Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents for the children,",
  "15": "and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am loved.",
  "16": "And be it [so], I -- I did not burden you, but being crafty, with guile I did take you;",
  "17": "any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I take advantage of you?",
  "18": "I entreated Titus, and did send with [him] the brother; did Titus take advantage of you? in the same spirit did we not walk? -- did we not in the same steps?",
  "19": "Again, think ye that to you we are making defence? before God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved, [are] for your up-building,",
  "20": "for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may find you, and I -- I may be found by you such as ye do not wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries, evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections,",
  "21": "lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom, and lasciviousness, that they did practise."
