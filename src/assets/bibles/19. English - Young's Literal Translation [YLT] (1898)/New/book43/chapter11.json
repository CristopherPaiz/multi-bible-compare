  "1": "And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --",
  "2": "and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing --",
  "3": "therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, `Sir, lo, he whom thou dost love is ailing;`",
  "4": "and Jesus having heard, said, `This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.`",
  "5": "And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,",
  "6": "when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,",
  "7": "then after this, he saith to the disciples, `We may go to Judea again;`",
  "8": "the disciples say to him, `Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!`",
  "9": "Jesus answered, `Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the light of this world he doth see;",
  "10": "and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.`",
  "11": "These things he said, and after this he saith to them, `Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;`",
  "12": "therefore said his disciples, `Sir, if he hath fallen asleep, he will be saved;`",
  "13": "but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.",
  "14": "Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, `Lazarus hath died;",
  "15": "and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;`",
  "16": "therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, `We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,`",
  "17": "Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.",
  "18": "And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,",
  "19": "and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;",
  "20": "Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.",
  "21": "Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;",
  "22": "but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God, God will give to thee;`",
  "23": "Jesus saith to her, `Thy brother shall rise again.`",
  "24": "Martha saith to him, `I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;`",
  "25": "Jesus said to her, `I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;",
  "26": "and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age;",
  "27": "believest thou this?` she saith to him, `Yes, sir, I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.`",
  "28": "And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, `The Teacher is present, and doth call thee;`",
  "29": "she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to him;",
  "30": "and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;",
  "31": "the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- `She doth go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.`",
  "32": "Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;`",
  "33": "Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,",
  "34": "`Where have ye laid him?` they say to him, `Sir, come and see;`",
  "35": "Jesus wept.",
  "36": "The Jews, therefore, said, `Lo, how he was loving him!`",
  "37": "and certain of them said, `Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?`",
  "38": "Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,",
  "39": "Jesus saith, `Take ye away the stone;` the sister of him who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him, `Sir, already he stinketh, for he is four days dead;`",
  "40": "Jesus saith to her, `Said I not to thee, that if thou mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?`",
  "41": "They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, `Father, I thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;",
  "42": "and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I said [it], that they may believe that Thou didst send me.`",
  "43": "And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, `Lazarus, come forth;`",
  "44": "and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus saith to them, `Loose him, and suffer to go.`",
  "45": "Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;",
  "46": "but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;",
  "47": "the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrim, and said, `What may we do? because this man doth many signs?",
  "48": "if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.`",
  "49": "and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, `Ye have not known anything,",
  "50": "nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.`",
  "51": "And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,",
  "52": "and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.",
  "53": "From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;",
  "54": "Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.",
  "55": "And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;",
  "56": "they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, `What doth appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?`",
  "57": "and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew [it], so that they may seize him."
