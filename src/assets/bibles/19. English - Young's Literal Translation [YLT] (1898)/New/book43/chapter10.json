  "2": "and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;",
  "3": "to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth lead them forth;",
  "4": "and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known his voice;",
  "5": "and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.`",
  "6": "This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;",
  "7": "Jesus said therefore again to them, `Verily, verily, I say to you -- I am the door of the sheep;",
  "8": "all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them;",
  "9": "I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.",
  "10": "`The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have [it] abundantly.",
  "11": "`I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;",
  "12": "and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;",

  "15": "according as the Father doth know me, and I know the Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,",
  "16": "and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and there shall become one flock -- one shepherd.",
  "17": "`Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that again I may take it;",
  "18": "no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself; authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to take it; this command I received from my Father.`",
  "19": "Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,",
  "20": "and many of them said, `He hath a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him?`",
  "21": "others said, `These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men`s eyes to open?`",
  "22": "And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,",
  "23": "and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,",
  "24": "the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, `Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou art the Christ, tell us freely.`",
  "25": "Jesus answered them, `I told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;",
  "26": "but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,",
  "27": "according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,",
  "28": "and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;",

  "30": "I and the Father are one.`",
  "31": "Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;",
  "32": "Jesus answered them, `Many good works did I shew you from my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?`",
  "33": "The Jews answered him, saying, `For a good work we do not stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a man, dost make thyself God.`",
  "34": "Jesus answered them, `Is it not having been written in your law: I said, ye are gods?",
  "35": "if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)",
  "36": "of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do ye say -- Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of God I am?",
  "37": "if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;",
  "38": "and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the Father, and I in Him.`",
  "39": "Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,",
  "40": "and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,",
  "41": "and many came unto him, and said -- `John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;`",
  "42": "and many did believe in him there."
