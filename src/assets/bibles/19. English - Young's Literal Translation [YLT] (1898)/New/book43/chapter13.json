  "1": "And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour hath come, that he may remove out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own who [are] in the world -- to the end he loved them.",
  "2": "And supper being come, the devil already having put [it] into the heart of Judas of Simon, Iscariot, that he may deliver him up,",
  "3": "Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him -- into [his] hands, and that from God he came forth, and unto God he goeth,",
  "4": "doth rise from the supper, and doth lay down his garments, and having taken a towel, he girded himself;",
  "5": "afterward he putteth water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe with the towel with which he was being girded.",
  "6": "He cometh, therefore, unto Simon Peter, and that one saith to him, `Sir, thou -- dost thou wash my feet?`",
  "7": "Jesus answered and said to him, `That which I do thou hast not known now, but thou shalt know after these things;`",
  "8": "Peter saith to him, `Thou mayest not wash my feet -- to the age.` Jesus answered him, `If I may not wash thee, thou hast no part with me;`",
  "9": "Simon Peter saith to him, `Sir, not my feet only, but also the hands and the head.`",
  "10": "Jesus saith to him, `He who hath been bathed hath no need save to wash his feet, but he is clean altogether; and ye are clean, but not all;`",
  "11": "for he knew him who is delivering him up; because of this he said, `Ye are not all clean.`",
  "12": "When, therefore, he washed their feet, and took his garments, having reclined (at meat) again, he said to them, `Do ye know what I have done to you?",
  "13": "ye call me, The Teacher and The Lord, and ye say well, for I am;",
  "14": "if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher -- ye also ought to wash one another`s feet.",
  "15": "`For an example I gave to you, that, according as I did to you, ye also may do;",
  "16": "verily, verily, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his lord, nor an apostle greater than he who sent him;",
  "17": "if these things ye have known, happy are ye, if ye may do them;",
  "18": "not concerning you all do I speak; I have known whom I chose for myself; but that the Writing may be fulfilled: He who is eating the bread with me, did lift up against me his heel.",
  "19": "`From this time I tell you, before its coming to pass, that, when it may come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he];",
  "20": "verily, verily, I say to you, he who is receiving whomsoever I may send, doth receive me; and he who is receiving me, doth receive Him who sent me.`",
  "21": "These things having said, Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and did testify, and said, `Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up;`",
  "22": "the disciples were looking, therefore, one at another, doubting concerning whom he speaketh.",
  "23": "And there was one of his disciples reclining (at meat) in the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus was loving;",
  "24": "Simon Peter, then, doth beckon to this one, to inquire who he may be concerning whom he speaketh,",
  "25": "and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus, respondeth to him, `Sir, who is it?`",
  "26": "Jesus answereth, `That one it is to whom I, having dipped the morsel, shall give it;` and having dipped the morsel, he giveth [it] to Judas of Simon, Iscariot.",
  "27": "And after the morsel, then the Adversary entered into that one, Jesus, therefore, saith to him, `What thou dost -- do quickly;`",
  "28": "and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him,",
  "29": "for certain were thinking, since Judas had the bag, that Jesus saith to him, `Buy what we have need of for the feast;` or that he may give something to the poor;",
  "30": "having received, therefore, the morsel, that one immediately went forth, and it was night.",
  "31": "When, therefore, he went forth, Jesus saith, `Now was the Son of Man glorified, and God was glorified in him;",
  "32": "if God was glorified in him, God also will glorify him in Himself; yea, immediately He will glorify him.",
  "33": "`Little children, yet a little am I with you; ye will seek me, and, according as I said to the Jews -- Whither I go away, ye are not able to come, to you also I do say [it] now.",
  "34": "`A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; according as I did love you, that ye also love one another;",
  "35": "in this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye may have love one to another.`",
  "36": "Simon Peter saith to him, `Sir, whither dost thou go away?` Jesus answered him, `Whither I go away, thou art not able now to follow me, but afterward thou shalt follow me.`",
  "37": "Peter saith to him, `Sir, wherefore am I not able to follow thee now? my life for thee I will lay down;`",
  "38": "Jesus answered him, `Thy life for me thou wilt lay down! verily, verily, I say to thee, a cock will not crow till thou mayest deny me thrice.`"
