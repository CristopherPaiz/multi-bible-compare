  "1": "And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth,",
  "2": "and his disciples asked him, saying, `Rabbi, who did sin, this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?`",
  "3": "Jesus answered, `Neither did this one sin nor his parents, but that the works of God may be manifested in him;",
  "4": "it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work: --",
  "5": "when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.`",
  "6": "These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man, and said to him,",
  "7": "`Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,` which is, interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and came seeing;",
  "8": "the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that he was blind, said, `Is not this he who is sitting and begging?`",
  "9": "others said -- `This is he;` and others -- `He is like to him;` he himself said, -- `I am [he].`",
  "10": "They said, therefore, to him, `How were thine eyes opened?`",
  "11": "he answered and said, `A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam, and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received sight;`",
  "12": "they said, therefore, to him, `Where is that one?` he saith, `I have not known.`",
  "13": "They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,",
  "14": "and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.",
  "15": "Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight, and he said to them, `Clay he did put upon my eyes, and I did wash -- and I see.`",
  "16": "Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, `This man is not from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;` others said, `How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs?` and there was a division among them.",
  "17": "They said to the blind man again, `Thou -- what dost thou say of him -- that he opened thine eyes?`",
  "18": "and he said -- `He is a prophet.` The Jews, therefore, did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight, till that they called the parents of him who received sight,",
  "19": "and they asked them, saying, `Is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?`",
  "20": "His parents answered them and said, `We have known that this is our son, and that he was born blind;",
  "21": "and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he himself shall speak concerning himself.`",
  "22": "These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if any one may confess him -- Christ, he may be put out of the synagogue;",
  "23": "because of this his parents said -- `He is of age, ask him.`",
  "24": "They called, therefore, a second time the man who was blind, and they said to him, `Give glory to God, we have known that this man is a sinner;`",
  "25": "he answered, therefore, and said, `If he be a sinner -- I have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now I see.`",
  "26": "And they said to him again, `What did he to thee? how did he open thine eyes?`",
  "27": "He answered them, `I told you already, and ye did not hear; why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his disciples?`",
  "28": "They reviled him, therefore, and said, `Thou art his disciple, and we are Moses` disciples;",
  "29": "we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one -- we have not known whence he is.`",
  "30": "The man answered and said to them, `Why, in this is a wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he opened my eyes!",
  "31": "and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him He doth hear;",
  "32": "from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind;",
  "33": "if this one were not from God, he were not able to do anything.`",
  "34": "They answered and said to him, `In sins thou wast born altogether, and thou dost teach us!` and they cast him forth without.",
  "35": "Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having found him, he said to him, `Dost thou believe in the Son of God?`",
  "36": "he answered and said, `Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?`",
  "37": "And Jesus said to him, `Thou hast both seen him, and he who is speaking with thee is he;`",
  "38": "and he said, `I believe, sir,` and bowed before him.",
  "39": "And Jesus said, `For judgment I to this world did come, that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become blind.`",
  "40": "And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, `Are we also blind?`",
  "41": "Jesus said to them, `If ye were blind, ye were not having had sin, but now ye say -- We see, therefore doth your sin remain."
