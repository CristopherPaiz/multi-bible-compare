  "18": "And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did command to depart to the other side;",
  "19": "and a certain scribe having come, said to him, `Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go;`",
  "20": "and Jesus saith to him, `The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head.`",
  "21": "And another of his disciples said to him, `Sir, permit me first to depart and to bury my father;`",
  "22": "and Jesus said to him, `Follow me, and suffer the dead to bury their own dead.`",

  "33": "and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city, they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.",
  "34": "And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their borders."
