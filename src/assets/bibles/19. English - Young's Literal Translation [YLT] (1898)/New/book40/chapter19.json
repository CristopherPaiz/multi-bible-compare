  "1": "And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these words, he removed from Galilee, and did come to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan,",
  "2": "and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.",
  "3": "And the Pharisees came near to him, tempting him, and saying to him, `Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?`",

  "5": "and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh?",
  "6": "so that they are no more two, but one flesh; what therefore God did join together, let no man put asunder.`",
  "7": "They say to him, `Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce, and to put her away?`",
  "8": "He saith to them -- `Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it hath not been so.",
  "9": "`And I say to you, that, whoever may put away his wife, if not for whoredom, and may marry another, doth commit adultery; and he who did marry her that hath been put away, doth commit adultery.`",
  "10": "His disciples say to him, `If the case of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry.`",
  "11": "And he said to them, `All do not receive this word, but those to whom it hath been given;",
  "12": "for there are eunuchs who from the mother`s womb were so born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive [it] -- let him receive.`",
  "13": "Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.",
  "14": "But Jesus said, `Suffer the children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of such is the reign of the heavens;`",
  "15": "and having laid on them [his] hands, he departed thence.",
  "16": "And lo, one having come near, said to him, `Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-during?`",
  "17": "And he said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good except One -- God; but if thou dost will to enter into the life, keep the commands.`",
  "18": "He saith to him, `What kind?` And Jesus said, `Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,",
  "19": "honour thy father and mother, and, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.`",
  "20": "The young man saith to him, `All these did I keep from my youth; what yet do I lack?`",
  "21": "Jesus said to him, `If thou dost will to be perfect, go away, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.`",
  "22": "And the young man, having heard the word, went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions;",
  "23": "and Jesus said to his disciples, `Verily I say to you, that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens;",
  "24": "and again I say to you, it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.`",
  "25": "And his disciples having heard, were amazed exceedingly, saying, `Who, then, is able to be saved?`",
  "26": "And Jesus having earnestly beheld, said to them, `With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.`",
  "27": "Then Peter answering said to him, `Lo, we did leave all, and follow thee, what then shall we have?`",
  "28": "And Jesus said to them, `Verily I say to you, that ye who did follow me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory, shall sit -- ye also -- upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;",
  "29": "and every one who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my name`s sake, an hundredfold shall receive, and life age-during shall inherit;",
  "30": "and many first shall be last, and last first."
