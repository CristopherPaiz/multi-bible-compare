  "1": "And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, unto the mount of the Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,",
  "2": "saying to them, `Go on to the village over-against you, and immediately ye shall find an ass bound, and a colt with her -- having loosed, bring ye to me;",
  "3": "and if any one may say anything to you, ye shall say, that the lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.`",
  "4": "And all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet, saying,",
  "5": "`Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy king doth come to thee, meek, and mounted on an ass, and a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.`",
  "6": "And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them,",
  "7": "brought the ass and the colt, and did put on them their garments, and set [him] upon them;",
  "8": "and the very great multitude spread their own garments in the way, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and were strewing in the way,",
  "9": "and the multitudes who were going before, and who were following, were crying, saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.`",
  "10": "And he having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, `Who is this?`",
  "11": "And the multitudes said, `This is Jesus the prophet, who [is] from Nazareth of Galilee.`",
  "12": "And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and did cast forth all those selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the seats of those selling the doves,",
  "13": "and he saith to them, `It hath been written, My house a house of prayer shall be called, but ye did make it a den of robbers.`",
  "14": "And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple, and he healed them,",
  "15": "and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David,` were much displeased;",
  "16": "and they said to him, `Hearest thou what these say?` And Jesus saith to them, `Yes, did ye never read, that, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise?`",
  "17": "And having left them, he went forth out of the city to Bethany, and did lodge there,",
  "18": "and in the morning turning back to the city, he hungered,",
  "19": "and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way, he came to it, and found nothing in it except leaves only, and he saith to it, `No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age;` and forthwith the fig-tree withered.",
  "20": "And the disciples having seen, did wonder, saying, `How did the fig-tree forthwith wither?`",
  "21": "And Jesus answering said to them, `Verily I say to you, If ye may have faith, and may not doubt, not only this of the fig-tree shall ye do, but even if to this mount ye may say, Be lifted up and be cast into the sea, it shall come to pass;",
  "22": "and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer, believing, ye shall receive.`",
  "23": "And he having come to the temple, there came to him when teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people, saying, `By what authority dost thou do these things? and who gave thee this authority?`",
  "24": "And Jesus answering said to them, `I will ask you -- I also -- one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things;",
  "25": "the baptism of John, whence was it? -- from heaven, or from men?` And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, `If we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Wherefore, then, did ye not believe him?",
  "26": "and if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.`",
  "27": "And answering Jesus they said, `We have not known.` He said to them -- he also -- `Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.",
  "28": "`And what think ye? A man had two children, and having come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my vineyard.`",
  "29": "And he answering said, `I will not,` but at last, having repented, he went.",
  "30": "`And having come to the second, he said in the same manner, and he answering said, I [go], sir, and went not;",
  "31": "which of the two did the will of the father?` They say to him, `The first.` Jesus saith to them, `Verily I say to you, that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into the reign of God,",
  "32": "for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him, and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did believe him, and ye, having seen, repented not at last -- to believe him.",
  "33": "`Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and did put a hedge round it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.",
  "34": "`And when the season of the fruits came nigh, he sent his servants unto the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it,",
  "35": "and the husbandmen having taken his servants, one they scourged, and one they killed, and one they stoned.",
  "36": "`Again he sent other servants more than the first, and they did to them in the same manner.",
  "37": "`And at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son;",
  "38": "and the husbandmen having seen the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and may possess his inheritance;",
  "39": "and having taken him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard, and killed him;",
  "40": "whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come, what will he do to these husbandmen?`",
  "41": "They say to him, `Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them, and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.`",
  "42": "Jesus saith to them, `Did ye never read in the Writings, A stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner; from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in our eyes.",
  "43": "`Because of this I say to you, that the reign of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its fruit;",
  "44": "and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken, and on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces.`",
  "45": "And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his similes, knew that of them he speaketh,",
  "46": "and seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, seeing they were holding him as a prophet."
