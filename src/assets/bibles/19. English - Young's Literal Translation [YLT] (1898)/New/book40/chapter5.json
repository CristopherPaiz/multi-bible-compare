  "12": "rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.",
  "13": "`Ye are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose savour, in what shall it be salted? for nothing is it good henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down by men.",
  "14": "`Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid;",
  "15": "nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house;",
  "16": "so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the heavens.",

  "18": "for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law, till that all may come to pass.",
  "19": "`Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.",
  "20": "`For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens.",
  "21": "`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;",
  "22": "but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! shall be in danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire.",
  "23": "`If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar, and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee,",

  "31": "`And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce;",
  "32": "but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery.",
  "33": "`Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths;",
  "34": "but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God,",
  "35": "nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,",
  "36": "nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not able one hair to make white or black;",
  "37": "but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is more than these is of the evil.",
  "38": "`Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth;",
  "39": "but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;",

  "41": "`And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two,",
  "42": "to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.",
  "43": "`Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy;",
  "44": "but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,",
  "45": "that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous.",
  "46": "`For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? do not also the tax-gatherers the same?",
  "47": "and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye abundant? do not also the tax-gatherers so?",
  "48": "ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who [is] in the heavens is perfect."
