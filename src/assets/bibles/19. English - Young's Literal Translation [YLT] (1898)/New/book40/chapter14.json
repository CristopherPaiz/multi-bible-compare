  "10": "and having sent, he beheaded John in the prison,",
  "11": "and his head was brought upon a plate, and was given to the damsel, and she brought [it] nigh to her mother.",
  "12": "And his disciples having come, took up the body, and buried it, and having come, they told Jesus,",
  "13": "and Jesus having heard, withdrew thence in a boat to a desolate place by himself, and the multitudes having heard did follow him on land from the cities.",
  "14": "And Jesus having come forth, saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion upon them, and did heal their infirm;",

  "21": "and those eating were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.",
  "22": "And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, till he might let away the multitudes;",
  "23": "and having let away the multitudes, he went up to the mountain by himself to pray, and evening having come, he was there alone,",
  "24": "and the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.",

  "30": "but seeing the wind vehement, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, `Sir, save me.`",

  "32": "and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled,",
  "33": "and those in the boat having come, did bow to him, saying, `Truly -- God`s Son art thou.`",

  "35": "and having recognized him, the men of that place sent forth to all that region round about, and they brought to him all who were ill,",
  "36": "and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment, and as many as did touch were saved."
