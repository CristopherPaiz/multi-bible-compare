  "1": "`For the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a householder, who went forth with the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard,",
  "2": "and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he sent them into his vineyard.",
  "3": "`And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle,",
  "4": "and to these he said, Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous I will give you;",
  "5": "and they went away. `Again, having gone forth about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner.",
  "6": "And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood all the day idle?",
  "7": "they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to them, Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous ye shall receive.",
  "8": "`And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having begun from the last -- unto the first.",
  "9": "And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did receive each a denary.",
  "10": "`And the first having come, did suppose that they shall receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary,",
  "11": "and having received [it], they were murmuring against the householder, saying,",
  "12": "that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day -- and the heat.",
  "13": "`And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with me?",
  "14": "take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to this, the last, also as to thee;",
  "15": "is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is thine eye evil because I am good?",
  "16": "So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, and few chosen.`",
  "17": "And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples by themselves in the way, and said to them,",
  "18": "`Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes,",
  "19": "and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and the third day he will rise again.`",
  "20": "Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing and asking something from him,",
  "21": "and he said to her, `What wilt thou?` She saith to him, `Say, that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.`",
  "22": "And Jesus answering said, `Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be baptized?` They say to him, `We are able.`",
  "23": "And he saith to them, `Of my cup indeed ye shall drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father.`",
  "24": "And the ten having heard, were much displeased with the two brothers,",
  "25": "and Jesus having called them near, said, `Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those great do exercise authority over them,",
  "26": "but not so shall it be among you, but whoever may will among you to become great, let him be your ministrant;",
  "27": "and whoever may will among you to be first, let him be your servant;",
  "28": "even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.`",
  "29": "And they going forth from Jericho, there followed him a great multitude,",
  "30": "and lo, two blind men sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus doth pass by, cried, saying, `Deal kindly with us, sir -- Son of David.`",
  "31": "And the multitude charged them that they might be silent, and they cried out the more, saying, `Deal kindly with us sir -- Son of David.`",
  "32": "And having stood, Jesus called them, and said, `What will ye [that] I may do to you?`",
  "33": "they say to him, `Sir, that our eyes may be opened;`",
  "34": "and having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."
