  "3": "but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid [them] upon the fire, a viper -- out of the heat having come -- did fasten on his hand.",
  "4": "And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said unto one another, `Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not suffer to live;`",
  "5": "he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil,",
  "6": "and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting [it] a long time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing [their] minds, said he was a god.",
  "7": "And in the neighbourhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, three days did courteously lodge [us];",
  "8": "and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having entered, and having prayed, having laid [his] hands on him, healed him;",
  "9": "this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed;",
  "10": "who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting sail -- they were lading [us] with the things that were necessary.",
  "11": "And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri,",
  "12": "and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days,",
  "13": "thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second [day] we came to Puteoli;",
  "14": "where, having found brethren, we were called upon to remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came;",
  "15": "and thence, the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and Three Taverns -- whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage.",
  "16": "And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him.",
  "17": "And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said unto them: `Men, brethren, I -- having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers -- a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the hands of the Romans;",
  "18": "who, having examined me, were wishing to release [me], because of their being no cause of death in me,",
  "19": "and the Jews having spoken against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar -- not as having anything to accuse my nation of;",
  "20": "for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with [you], for because of the hope of Israel with this chain I am bound.`",
