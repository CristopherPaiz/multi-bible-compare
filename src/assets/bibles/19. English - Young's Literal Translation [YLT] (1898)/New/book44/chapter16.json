  "1": "And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,",
  "2": "who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;",
  "3": "this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken [him], he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a Greek.",
  "4": "And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,",
  "5": "then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;",
  "6": "and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,",
  "7": "having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,",
  "8": "and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.",
  "9": "And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, `Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;` --",
  "10": "and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them,",
  "11": "having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,",
  "12": "thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,",
  "13": "on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,",
  "14": "and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;",
  "15": "and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, `If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;` and she constrained us.",
  "16": "And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,",
  "17": "she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, `These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;`",
  "18": "and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;` and it came forth the same hour.",
  "19": "And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them] to the market-place, unto the rulers,",
  "20": "and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, `These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;",
  "21": "and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.`",
  "22": "And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat [them] with rods,",
  "23": "many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,",
  "24": "who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.",
  "25": "And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,",
  "26": "and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;",
  "27": "and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,",
  "28": "and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, `Thou mayest not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.`",
  "29": "And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,",
  "30": "and having brought them forth, said, `Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?`",
  "31": "and they said, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved -- thou and thy house;`",
  "32": "and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;",
  "33": "and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,",
  "34": "having brought them also into his house, he set food before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.",
  "35": "And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, `Let those men go;`",
  "36": "and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- `The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;`",
  "37": "and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast [us] to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.`",
  "38": "And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,",
  "39": "and having come, they besought them, and having brought [them] forth, they were asking [them] to go forth from the city;",
  "40": "and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into [the house of] Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth."
