  "3": "especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things -- both customs and questions -- among Jews; wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently to hear me.",
  "4": "`The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do all the Jews,",
  "5": "knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;",
  "6": "and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,",
  "7": "to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;",
  "8": "why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?",
  "9": "`I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to do,",
  "10": "which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,",
  "11": "and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange cities.",
  "12": "`In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with authority and commission from the chief priests --",
  "13": "at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light -- and those going on with me;",
  "14": "and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to kick!",
  "15": "`And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute;",

  "18": "to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.",
  "19": "`Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,",
  "20": "but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;",
  "21": "because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in the temple -- were endeavouring to kill [me].",
  "22": "`Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,",

  "30": "And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,",
  "31": "and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying -- `This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;`",
  "32": "and Agrippa said to Festus, `This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.`"
