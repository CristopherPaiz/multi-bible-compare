  "1": "Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God,",
  "2": "so that he who is setting himself against the authority, against God`s ordinance hath resisted; and those resisting, to themselves shall receive judgment.",
  "3": "For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have praise from it,",
  "4": "for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil.",
  "5": "Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,",
  "6": "for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually;",
  "7": "render, therefore, to all [their] dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honour, the honour.",
  "8": "To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other -- law he hath fulfilled,",
  "9": "for, `Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet;` and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;`",
  "10": "the love to the neighbor doth work no ill; the love, therefore, [is] the fulness of law.",
  "11": "And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already [is] to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer [is] our salvation than when we did believe;",
  "12": "the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light;",
  "13": "as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation;",
  "14": "but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought -- for desires."
