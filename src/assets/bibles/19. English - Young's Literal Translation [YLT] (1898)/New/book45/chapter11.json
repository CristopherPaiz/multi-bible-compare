  "1": "I say, then, Did God cast away His people? let it not be! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:",
  "2": "God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have ye not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing saith? how he doth plead with God concerning Israel, saying,",
  "3": "`Lord, Thy prophets they did kill, and Thy altars they dug down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;`",
  "4": "but what saith the divine answer to him? `I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.`",
  "5": "So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there hath been;",
  "6": "and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becometh no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work.",
  "7": "What then? What Israel doth seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,",
  "8": "according as it hath been written, `God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,` -- unto this very day,",
  "9": "and David saith, `Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them;",
  "10": "let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their back do Thou always bow down.`",
  "11": "I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it not be! but by their fall the salvation [is] to the nations, to arouse them to jealousy;",
  "12": "and if the fall of them [is] the riches of a world, and the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more the fulness of them?",
  "13": "For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;",
  "14": "if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them,",
  "15": "for if the casting away of them [is] a reconciliation of the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?",
  "16": "and if the first-fruit [is] holy, the lump also; and if the root [is] holy, the branches also.",
  "17": "And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree didst become --",
  "18": "do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast, thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee!",
  "19": "Thou wilt say, then, `The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;` right!",
  "20": "by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;",
  "21": "for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare thee.",
  "22": "Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou mayest remain in the goodness, otherwise, thou also shalt be cut off.",
  "23": "And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;",
  "24": "for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who [are] according to nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?",
  "25": "For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret -- that ye may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of the nations may come in;",
  "26": "and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath been written, `There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,",
  "27": "and this to them [is] the covenant from Me, when I may take away their sins.`",
  "28": "As regards, indeed, the good tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on account of the fathers;",
  "29": "for unrepented of [are] the gifts and the calling of God;",
  "30": "for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these:",
  "31": "so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness;",
  "32": "for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness.",
  "33": "O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!",
  "34": "for who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become His counsellor?",
  "35": "or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back to him again?",
  "36": "because of Him, and through Him, and to Him [are] the all things; to Him [is] the glory -- to the ages. Amen."
