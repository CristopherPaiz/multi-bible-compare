  "1": "Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,",
  "2": "that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --",
  "3": "for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ -- for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,",
  "4": "who are Israelites, whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises,",
  "5": "whose [are] the fathers, and of whom [is] the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen.",
  "6": "And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who [are] of Israel are these Israel;",
  "7": "nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children, but -- `in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;`",
  "8": "that is, the children of the flesh -- these [are] not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed;",
  "9": "for the word of promise [is] this; `According to this time I will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.`",
  "10": "And not only [so], but also Rebecca, having conceived by one -- Isaac our father --",
  "11": "(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her --",
  "12": "`The greater shall serve the less;`",
  "13": "according as it hath been written, `Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.`",
  "14": "What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness [is] with God? let it not be!",
  "15": "for to Moses He saith, `I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;`",
  "16": "so, then -- not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:",
  "17": "for the Writing saith to Pharaoh -- `For this very thing I did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;`",
  "18": "so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom He willeth, He doth harden.",
  "19": "Thou wilt say, then, to me, `Why yet doth He find fault? for His counsel who hath resisted?`",
  "20": "nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form [it], Why me didst thou make thus?",
  "21": "hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?",
  "22": "And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,",
  "23": "and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call -- us --",
  "24": "not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,",
  "25": "as also in Hosea He saith, `I will call what [is] not My people -- My people; and her not beloved -- Beloved,",
  "26": "and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.`",
  "27": "And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, `If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;",
  "28": "for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land.",
  "29": "and according as Isaiah saith before, `Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.`",
  "30": "What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that [is] of faith,",
  "31": "and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;",
  "32": "wherefore? because -- not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,",
  "33": "according as it hath been written, `Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.`"
