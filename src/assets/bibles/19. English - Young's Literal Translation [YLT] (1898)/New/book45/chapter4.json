  "1": "What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh?",
  "2": "for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to boast -- but not before god;",
  "3": "for what doth the writing say? `And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;`",
  "4": "and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;",
  "5": "and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness:",
  "6": "even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works:",
  "7": "`Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered;",
  "8": "happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.`",
  "9": "[Is] this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness?",
  "10": "how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;",
  "11": "and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,",
  "12": "and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that [is] in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.",
  "13": "For not through law [is] the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith;",
  "14": "for if they who are of law [are] heirs, the faith hath been made void, and the promise hath been made useless;",
  "15": "for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither [is] transgression.",
  "16": "Because of this [it is] of faith, that [it may be] according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which [is] of the law only, but also to that which [is] of the faith of Abraham,",
  "17": "who is father of us all (according as it hath been written -- `A father of many nations I have set thee,`) before Him whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being.",
  "18": "Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: `So shall thy seed be;`",
  "19": "and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah`s womb,",
  "20": "and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,",
  "21": "and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to do:",
  "22": "wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.",
  "23": "And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,",
  "24": "but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead,",
  "25": "who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous."
