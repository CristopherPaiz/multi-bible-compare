  "3": "among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath -- as also the others,",
  "4": "and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love with which He loved us,",
  "5": "even being dead in the trespasses, did make us to live together with the Christ, (by grace ye are having been saved,)",
  "6": "and did raise [us] up together, and did seat [us] together in the heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus,",
  "7": "that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus,",

  "14": "for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down,",
  "15": "the enmity in his flesh, the law of the commands in ordinances having done away, that the two he might create in himself into one new man, making peace,",
  "16": "and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in it,",
  "17": "and having come, he did proclaim good news -- peace to you -- the far-off and the nigh,",
  "18": "because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father.",
  "19": "Then, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,",

  "21": "in whom all the building fitly framed together doth increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord,",
  "22": "in whom also ye are builded together, for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
