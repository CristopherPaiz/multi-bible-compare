  "1": "And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,",
  "2": "for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,",
  "3": "for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who is with child, and they shall not escape;",
  "4": "and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;",
  "5": "all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,",
  "6": "so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,",
  "7": "for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,",
  "8": "and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of salvation,",
  "9": "because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "10": "who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;",
  "11": "wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.",
  "12": "And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,",
  "13": "and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;",
  "14": "and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;",
  "15": "see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;",
  "16": "always rejoice ye;",
  "17": "continually pray ye;",
  "18": "in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.",
  "19": "The Spirit quench not;",
  "20": "prophesyings despise not;",
  "21": "all things prove; that which is good hold fast;",
  "22": "from all appearance of evil abstain ye;",
  "23": "and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;",
  "24": "stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].",
  "25": "Brethren, pray for us;",
  "26": "salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;",
  "27": "I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;",
  "28": "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen."
