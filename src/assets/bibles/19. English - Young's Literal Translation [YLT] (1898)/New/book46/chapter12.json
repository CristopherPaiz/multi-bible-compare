  "1": "And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant;",
  "2": "ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols -- as ye were led -- being carried away;",
  "3": "wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus [is] anathema, and no one is able to say Jesus [is] Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.",
  "4": "And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;",
  "5": "and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord;",
  "6": "and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same God -- who is working the all in all.",
  "7": "And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;",
  "8": "for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;",
  "9": "and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit;",
  "10": "and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:",
  "11": "and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intendeth.",
  "12": "For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ,",
  "13": "for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink,",
  "14": "for also the body is not one member, but many;",
  "15": "if the foot may say, `Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;` it is not, because of this, not of the body;",
  "16": "and if the ear may say, `Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body;` it is not, because of this, not of the body?",
  "17": "If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if the whole hearing, where the smelling?",
  "18": "and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,",
  "19": "and if all were one member, where the body?",
  "20": "and now, indeed, [are] many members, and one body;",
  "21": "and an eye is not able to say to the hand, `I have no need of thee;` nor again the head to the feet, `I have no need of you.`",
  "22": "But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,",
  "23": "and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,",
  "24": "and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,",
  "25": "that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,",
  "26": "and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with [it] do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with [it] do all the members;",
  "27": "and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.",
  "28": "And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;",
  "29": "[are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all powers?",
  "30": "have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?",
  "31": "and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:"
