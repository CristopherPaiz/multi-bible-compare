  "2": "and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;",
  "3": "and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.",
  "4": "Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;",
  "5": "for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --",
  "6": "yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;",
  "7": "but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
  "8": "But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;",

  "10": "for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol`s temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,",

  "12": "and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ ye sin;",
  "13": "wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause to stumble."
