  "1": "And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;",
  "2": "with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,",
  "3": "for yet ye are fleshly, for where [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?",
  "4": "for when one may say, `I, indeed, am of Paul;` and another, `I -- of Apollos;` are ye not fleshly?",
  "5": "Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?",
  "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;",
  "7": "so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;",
  "8": "and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,",
  "9": "for of God we are fellow-workmen; God`s tillage, God`s building ye are.",
  "10": "According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on [it],",
  "11": "for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;",
  "12": "and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --",
  "13": "of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare [it], because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;",
  "14": "if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [it], a wage he shall receive;",
  "15": "if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.",
  "16": "have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?",
  "17": "if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.",
  "18": "Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,",
  "19": "for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, `Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;`",
  "20": "and again, `The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.`",
  "21": "So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,",
  "22": "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,",
  "23": "and ye [are] Christ`s, and Christ [is] God`s."
