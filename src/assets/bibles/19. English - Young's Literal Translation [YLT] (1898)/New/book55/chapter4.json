  "1": "I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign --",
  "2": "preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,",
  "3": "for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing,",
  "4": "and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.",
  "5": "And thou -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance,",
  "6": "for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived;",

  "11": "Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;",

  "14": "Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,",
  "15": "of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words;",
  "16": "in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)",
  "17": "and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,",
  "18": "and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save [me] -- to his heavenly kingdom; to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.",
  "19": "Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus` household;",
  "20": "Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm;",
  "21": "be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.",
  "22": "The Lord Jesus Christ [is] with thy spirit; the grace [is] with you! Amen."
