  "5": "who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,",
  "6": "in which ye are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials,",
  "7": "that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ,",
  "8": "whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,",

  "12": "to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking.",
  "13": "Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,",
  "14": "as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,",
  "15": "but according as He who did call you [is] holy, ye also, become holy in all behaviour,",

  "21": "who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God.",
  "22": "Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love ye earnestly,",
  "23": "being begotten again, not out of seed corruptible, but incorruptible, through a word of God -- living and remaining -- to the age;",
  "24": "because all flesh [is] as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell away,",
  "25": "and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you."
