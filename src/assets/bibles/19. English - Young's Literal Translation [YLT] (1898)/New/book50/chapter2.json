  "6": "who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to be equal to God,",
  "7": "but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,",
  "8": "and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross,",
  "9": "wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that [is] above every name,",

  "23": "him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately;",
  "24": "and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.",
  "25": "And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you,",
  "26": "seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,",
