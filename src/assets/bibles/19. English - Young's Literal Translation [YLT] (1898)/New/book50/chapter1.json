  "1": "Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministrants;",
  "2": "Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "3": "I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,",
  "4": "always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,",
  "5": "for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,",
  "6": "having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of Jesus Christ,",
  "7": "according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.",
  "8": "For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,",
  "9": "and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,",
  "10": "for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,",
  "11": "being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.",
  "12": "And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,",
  "13": "so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,",
  "14": "and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.",
  "15": "Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;",
  "16": "the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,",
  "17": "and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:",
  "18": "what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.",
  "19": "For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,",
  "20": "according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,",
  "21": "for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.",
  "22": "And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;",
  "23": "for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,",
  "24": "and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,",
  "25": "and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,",
  "26": "that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.",
  "27": "Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,",
  "28": "and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;",
  "29": "because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;",
  "30": "the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me."
