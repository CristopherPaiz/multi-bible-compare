  "1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,",

  "16": "for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;",
  "17": "but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?",
  "18": "and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --",
  "19": "and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
