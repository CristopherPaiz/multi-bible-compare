  "6": "as also in another [place] He saith, `Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;`",

  "13": "for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,",
  "14": "and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil."
