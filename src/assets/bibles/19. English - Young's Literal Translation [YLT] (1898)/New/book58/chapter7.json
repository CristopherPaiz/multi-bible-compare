  "1": "For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,",
  "2": "to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,` and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)",
  "3": "without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.",
  "4": "And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,",
  "5": "and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;",
  "6": "and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,",
  "7": "and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --",
  "8": "and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there [he], who is testified to that he was living,",
  "9": "and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,",
  "10": "for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.",
  "11": "If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?",
  "12": "for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,",
  "13": "for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,",
  "14": "for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.",
  "15": "And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,",
  "16": "who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,",
  "17": "for He doth testify -- `Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;`",
  "18": "for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,",
  "19": "(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.",
  "20": "And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,",
  "21": "and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;`)",
  "22": "by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,",
  "23": "and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;",
  "24": "and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,",
  "25": "whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.",
  "26": "For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,",
  "27": "who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;",
  "28": "for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law [appointeth] the Son -- to the age having been perfected."
