  "1": "For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,",
  "2": "since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?",
  "3": "but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every year,",
  "4": "for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.",
  "5": "Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,",
  "6": "in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,",
  "7": "then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;`",
  "8": "saying above -- `Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,` -- which according to the law are offered --",
  "9": "then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;` he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;",
  "10": "in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,",
  "11": "and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.",
  "12": "And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --",
  "13": "as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies [as] his footstool,",
  "14": "for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;",
  "15": "and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,",
  "16": "`This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,`",
  "17": "and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;`",
  "18": "and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more offering for sin.",
  "19": "Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,",
  "20": "which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --",
  "21": "and a high priest over the house of God,",
  "22": "may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;",
  "23": "may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful [is] He who did promise),",
  "24": "and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,",
  "25": "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.",
  "26": "For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,",
  "27": "but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;",
  "28": "any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,",
  "29": "of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?",
  "30": "for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance [is] Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;` and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;` --",
  "31": "fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.",
  "32": "And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,",
  "33": "partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,",
  "34": "for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.",
  "35": "Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,",
  "36": "for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,",
  "37": "for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;",
  "38": "and `the righteous by faith shall live,` and `if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,`",
  "39": "and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul."
