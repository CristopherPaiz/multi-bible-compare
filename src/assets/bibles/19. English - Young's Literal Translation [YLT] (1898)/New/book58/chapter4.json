  "1": "We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,",
  "2": "for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,",
  "3": "for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;` and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,",

  "5": "and in this [place] again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;`",

  "13": "and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning.",
  "14": "Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,",
  "15": "for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;",
  "16": "we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help."
