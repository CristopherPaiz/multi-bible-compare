  "1": "In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,",
  "2": "in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;",
  "3": "who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,",
  "4": "having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.",
  "5": "For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?` and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?`",
  "6": "and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;`",
  "7": "and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;`",
  "8": "and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy reign;",
  "9": "thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners;`",
  "10": "and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;",
  "11": "these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,",
  "12": "and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.`",
  "13": "And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?`",
  "14": "are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"
