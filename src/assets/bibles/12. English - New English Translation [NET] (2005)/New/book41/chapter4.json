  "1": "Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake.",
  "2": "He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them:",
  "3": "“Listen! A sower went out to sow.",
  "4": "And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
  "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.",
  "6": "When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered.",
  "7": "Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.",
  "8": "But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”",
  "9": "And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”",
  "10": "When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.",
  "11": "He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,",
  "12": "so that although they look they may look but not see, and although they hear they may hear but not understand, so they may not repent and be forgiven.”",
  "13": "He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable?",
  "14": "The sower sows the word.",
  "15": "These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them.",
  "16": "These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy.",
  "17": "But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.",
  "18": "Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word,",
  "19": "but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing.",
  "20": "But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”",
  "21": "He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand?",
  "22": "For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light.",
  "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!”",
  "24": "And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you.",
  "25": "For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”",
  "26": "He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground.",
  "27": "He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.",
  "28": "By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.",
  "29": "And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”",
  "30": "He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it?",
  "31": "It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground —",
  "32": "when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”",
  "33": "So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.",
  "34": "He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.",
  "35": "On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.”",
  "36": "So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him.",
  "37": "Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped.",
  "38": "But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?”",
  "39": "So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm.",
  "40": "And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?”",
  "41": "They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”"
