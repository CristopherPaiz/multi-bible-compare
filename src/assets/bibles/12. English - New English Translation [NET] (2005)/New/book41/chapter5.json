  "2": "Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him.",
  "3": "He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.",

  "11": "There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding.",
  "12": "And the demonic spirits begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.”",
  "13": "Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake.",
  "14": "Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.",
  "15": "They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the one who had the “Legion” — and they were afraid.",

  "17": "Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.",
  "18": "As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him.",

  "29": "At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.",
  "30": "Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”",
  "31": "His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”",
  "32": "But he looked around to see who had done it.",
  "33": "Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.",
  "34": "He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”",
  "35": "While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?”",

  "41": "Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “ Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.”",
