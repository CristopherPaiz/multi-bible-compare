  "1": "Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,",
  "2": "“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.”",
  "3": "He answered them, “And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?",
  "4": "For God said, ‘ Honor your father and mother ’ and ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’",
  "5": "But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,”",
  "6": "he does not need to honor his father.’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition.",
  "7": "Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said,",

  "9": "and they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”",

  "13": "And he replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.",
  "14": "Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.”",
  "15": "But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”",
  "16": "Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish?",
  "17": "Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer?",
  "18": "But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person.",
  "19": "For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.",
  "20": "These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.”",
  "21": "After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.",
  "22": "A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!”",
  "23": "But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, “Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.”",
  "24": "So he answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”",
  "25": "But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”",
  "26": "“It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” he said.",
  "27": "“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”",

  "30": "Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.",
  "31": "As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.",
  "32": "Then Jesus called the disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.”",
  "33": "The disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?”",
  "34": "Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven — and a few small fish.”",
  "35": "After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground,",
  "36": "he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.",
  "37": "They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.",

  "39": "After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
