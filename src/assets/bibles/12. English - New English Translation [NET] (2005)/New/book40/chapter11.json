  "1": "When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.",

  "5": "The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.",
  "6": "Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”",
  "7": "While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?",

  "11": "“I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.",

  "20": "Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many of his miracles, because they did not repent.",
  "21": "“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.",
  "22": "But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!",
  "23": "And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Sodom, it would have continued to this day.",
