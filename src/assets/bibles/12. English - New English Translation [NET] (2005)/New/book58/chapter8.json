  "11": "“ And there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘ Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest.",
  "12": "“ For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer.”",
