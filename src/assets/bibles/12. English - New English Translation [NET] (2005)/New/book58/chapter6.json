  "1": "Therefore we must progress beyond the elementary instructions about Christ and move on to maturity, not laying this foundation again: repentance from dead works and faith in God,",
  "2": "teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.",
  "3": "And this is what we intend to do, if God permits.",

  "18": "so that we who have found refuge in him may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things, since it is impossible for God to lie.",
  "19": "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain,",
