  "6": "But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.",

  "18": "And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?",
  "19": "So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief."
