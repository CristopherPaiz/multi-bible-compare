  "4": "I say this so that no one will deceive you through arguments that sound reasonable.",
  "5": "For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ.",
  "6": "Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,",
  "7": "rooted and built up in him and firm in your faith just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.",
  "8": "Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty, deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.",

  "18": "Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels pass judgment on you. That person goes on at great lengths about what he has supposedly seen, but he is puffed up with empty notions by his fleshly mind.",

  "21": "“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”",
  "22": "These are all destined to perish with use, founded as they are on human commands and teachings.",
