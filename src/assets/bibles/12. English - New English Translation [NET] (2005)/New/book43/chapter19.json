  "5": "So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Look, here is the man!”",
  "6": "When the chief priests and their officers saw him, they shouted out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said, “You take him and crucify him! Certainly I find no reason for an accusation against him!”",
  "7": "The Jewish leaders replied, “We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!”",
  "8": "When Pilate heard what they said, he was more afraid than ever,",
  "9": "and he went back into the governor’s residence and said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.",
  "10": "So Pilate said, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have the authority to release you, and to crucify you?”",
  "11": "Jesus replied, “You would have no authority over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”",
  "12": "From this point on, Pilate tried to release him. But the Jewish leaders shouted out, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar! Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!”",

  "19": "Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross, which read: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.”",
  "20": "Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.",
  "21": "Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The king of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am king of the Jews.’”",
  "22": "Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”",

  "24": "So the soldiers said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but throw dice to see who will get it.” This took place to fulfill the scripture that says, “ They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they threw dice.” So the soldiers did these things.",

  "32": "So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus, first the one and then the other.",
  "33": "But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.",
  "34": "But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out immediately.",
  "35": "And the person who saw it has testified (and his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth), so that you also may believe.",
  "36": "For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled, “ Not a bone of his will be broken.”",
  "37": "And again another scripture says, “ They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”",
  "38": "After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders ), asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he went and took the body away.",

  "41": "Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried.",
  "42": "And so, because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus’ body there."
