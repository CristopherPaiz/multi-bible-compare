  "1": "“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.",
  "2": "The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
  "3": "The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
  "4": "When he has brought all his own sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.",
  "5": "They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice.”",
  "6": "Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.",
  "7": "So Jesus said to them again, “I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door for the sheep.",
  "8": "All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.",
  "9": "I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and find pasture.",
  "10": "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.",
  "11": "“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
  "12": "The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.",
  "13": "Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep, he runs away.",
  "14": "“I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me —",
  "15": "just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
  "16": "I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.",
  "17": "This is why the Father loves me — because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again.",
  "18": "No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This commandment I received from my Father.”",
  "19": "Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words.",
  "20": "Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?”",
  "21": "Others said, “These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. A demon cannot cause the blind to see, can it?”",
  "22": "Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem.",
  "23": "It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico.",
  "24": "The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”",
  "25": "Jesus replied, “I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me.",
  "26": "But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep.",
  "27": "My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.",
  "28": "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.",
  "29": "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.",
  "30": "The Father and I are one.”",
  "31": "The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death.",
  "32": "Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?”",
  "33": "The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”",
  "34": "Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘ I said, you are gods ’?",
  "35": "If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),",
  "36": "do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?",
  "37": "If I do not perform the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.",
  "38": "But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.”",
  "39": "Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.",
  "40": "Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.",
  "41": "Many came to him and began to say, “John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!”",
  "42": "And many believed in Jesus there."
