  "1": "From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer,",
  "2": "to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.",
  "3": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!",
  "4": "I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,",
  "5": "because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.",
  "6": "I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ.",
  "7": "I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
  "8": "So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper,",
  "9": "I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love — I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus —",
  "10": "I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus,",
  "11": "who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me.",
  "12": "I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you.",
  "13": "I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.",
  "14": "However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness.",
  "15": "For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,",
  "16": "no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.",
  "17": "Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.",
  "18": "Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.",
  "19": "I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self.",
  "20": "Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.",
  "21": "Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do.",
  "22": "At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.",
  "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.",
  "24": "Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too.",
  "25": "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
