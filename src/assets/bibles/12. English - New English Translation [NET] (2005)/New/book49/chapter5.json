  "1": "Therefore, be imitators of God as dearly loved children",
  "2": "and live in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.",
  "3": "But among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints.",
  "4": "Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting — all of which are out of character — but rather thanksgiving.",
  "5": "For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.",
  "6": "Let nobody deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.",
  "7": "Therefore do not be partakers with them,",
  "8": "for you were at one time darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light —",
  "9": "for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth —",
  "10": "trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.",
  "12": "For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.",
  "13": "But all things being exposed by the light are made evident.",
  "14": "For everything made evident is light, and for this reason it says: “Awake, O sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you!”",
  "15": "Therefore be very careful how you live — not as unwise but as wise,",
  "16": "taking advantage of every opportunity, because the days are evil.",
  "17": "For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise by understanding what the Lord’s will is.",
  "18": "And do not get drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit,",
  "19": "speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord,",
  "20": "always giving thanks to God the Father for each other in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "21": "and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord,",
  "23": "because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church — he himself being the savior of the body.",
  "24": "But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her",
  "26": "to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word,",
  "27": "so that he may present the church to himself as glorious — not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.",
  "28": "In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
  "29": "For no one has ever hated his own body but he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ also does the church,",
  "30": "for we are members of his body.",
  "31": "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.",
  "32": "This mystery is great — but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church.",
  "33": "Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
