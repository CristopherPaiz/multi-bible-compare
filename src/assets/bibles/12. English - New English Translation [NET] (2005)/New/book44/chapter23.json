  "4": "Those standing near him said, “Do you dare insult God’s high priest?”",
  "5": "Paul replied, “I did not realize, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, ‘ You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”",

  "16": "But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush, he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.",
  "17": "Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to report to him.”",
  "18": "So the centurion took him and brought him to the commanding officer and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”",

  "20": "He replied, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as if they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him.",
  "21": "So do not let them persuade you to do this, because more than forty of them are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for you to agree to their request.”",
