  "6": "Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a vast throng, like the roar of many waters and like loud crashes of thunder. They were shouting: “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the All-Powerful, reigns!",
  "7": "Let us rejoice and exult and give him glory, because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.",
  "8": "She was permitted to be dressed in bright, clean, fine linen” (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).",
  "9": "Then the angel said to me, “Write the following: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” He also said to me, “These are the true words of God.”",
