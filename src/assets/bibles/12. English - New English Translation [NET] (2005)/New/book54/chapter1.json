  "1": "From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,",
  "2": "to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!",
  "3": "As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings,",
  "4": "nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith.",
  "5": "But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.",
  "6": "Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion.",
  "7": "They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently.",

  "14": "and our Lord’s grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus.",
  "15": "This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners” — and I am the worst of them!",
  "16": "But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.",
  "17": "Now to the eternal king, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.",
  "18": "I put this charge before you, Timothy my child, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight.",
  "19": "To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith.",
  "20": "Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme."
