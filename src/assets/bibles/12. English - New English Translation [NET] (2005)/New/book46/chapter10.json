  "3": "and all ate the same spiritual food,",
  "4": "and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.",
  "5": "But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were cut down in the wilderness.",
  "6": "These things happened as examples for us, so that we will not crave evil things as they did.",
  "7": "So do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “ The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”",
  "8": "And let us not be immoral, as some of them were, and twenty-three thousand died in a single day.",
  "9": "And let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes.",
  "10": "And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.",
  "11": "These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come.",
  "12": "So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall.",
  "13": "No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others. And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.",
  "14": "So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.",
  "15": "I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say.",
  "16": "Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ?",
  "17": "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread.",
  "18": "Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?",
  "19": "Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything?",
  "20": "No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.",
  "21": "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons.",
  "22": "Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?",

  "24": "Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person.",
  "25": "Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience,",
  "26": "for the earth and its abundance are the Lord’s.",
  "27": "If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience.",
  "28": "But if someone says to you, “This is from a sacrifice,” do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience —",

  "33": "just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved."
