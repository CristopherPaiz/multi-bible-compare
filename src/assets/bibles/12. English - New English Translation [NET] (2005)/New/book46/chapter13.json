  "1": "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.",
  "2": "And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.",
  "3": "If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast, but do not have love, I receive no benefit.",
  "4": "Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up.",
  "5": "It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered or resentful.",
  "6": "It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth.",
  "7": "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
  "8": "Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside.",
  "9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part,",

  "11": "When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult, I set aside childish ways.",
  "12": "For now we see in a mirror indirectly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known.",
  "13": "And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."
