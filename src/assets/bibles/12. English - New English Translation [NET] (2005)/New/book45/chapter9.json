  "1": "I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit —",
  "2": "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.",
  "3": "For I could wish that I myself were accursed — cut off from Christ — for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen,",
  "4": "who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.",
  "5": "To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, by human descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever! Amen.",
  "6": "It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,",
  "7": "nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants; rather “ through Isaac will your descendants be counted.”",
  "8": "This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants.",
  "9": "For this is what the promise declared: “ About a year from now I will return and Sarah will have a son.”",
  "10": "Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac —",
  "11": "even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling) —",
  "12": "it was said to her, “ The older will serve the younger,”",
  "13": "just as it is written: “ Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”",
  "14": "What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!",
  "15": "For he says to Moses: “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”",
  "16": "So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.",
  "17": "For the scripture says to Pharaoh: “ For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”",
  "18": "So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden.",
  "19": "You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?”",
  "20": "But who indeed are you — a mere human being — to talk back to God? Does what is molded say to the molder, “ Why have you made me like this? ”",
  "21": "Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use?",
  "22": "But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction?",
  "23": "And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory —",
  "24": "even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?",
  "25": "As he also says in Hosea: “ I will call those who were not my people, ‘ My people,’ and I will call her who was unloved, ‘ My beloved.’”",
  "26": "“ And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘ You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘ sons of the living God.’”",
  "27": "And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, “ Though the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved,",
  "28": "for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly.”",
  "29": "Just as Isaiah predicted, “ If the Lord of armies had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have resembled Gomorrah.”",
  "30": "What shall we say then? — that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith,",
  "31": "but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it.",
  "32": "Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,",
  "33": "just as it is written, “ Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble and a rock that will make them fall, yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame. ”"
