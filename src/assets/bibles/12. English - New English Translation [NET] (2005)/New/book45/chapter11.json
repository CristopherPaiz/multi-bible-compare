  "1": "So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?",
  "3": "“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life! ”",
  "4": "But what was the divine response to him? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal.”",
  "5": "So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.",
  "6": "And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.",
  "7": "What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The rest were hardened,",
  "8": "as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, to this very day.”",
  "9": "And David says, “Let their table become a snare and trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;",
  "10": "let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and make their backs bend continually.”",
  "11": "I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.",
  "12": "Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration bring?",
  "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,",
  "14": "if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.",
  "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?",
  "16": "If the first portion of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches.",
  "17": "Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root,",
  "18": "do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.",
  "19": "Then you will say, “The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”",
  "20": "Granted! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear!",
  "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.",
  "22": "Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God — harshness toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.",
  "23": "And even they — if they do not continue in their unbelief — will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",
  "24": "For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?",
  "25": "For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.",
  "26": "And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come out of Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.",
  "27": "And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.”",
  "28": "In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.",
  "29": "For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.",
  "30": "Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience,",
  "31": "so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.",
  "32": "For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all.",
  "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how fathomless his ways!",
  "34": "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?",
  "35": "Or who has first given to God, that God needs to repay him?",
  "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen."
