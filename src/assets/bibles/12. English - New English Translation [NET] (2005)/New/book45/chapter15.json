  "6": "so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "7": "Receive one another, then, just as Christ also received you, to God’s glory.",
  "8": "For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth to confirm the promises made to the fathers,",
  "9": "and thus the Gentiles glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, “ Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles, and I will sing praises to your name.”",

  "16": "to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I serve the gospel of God like a priest, so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.",
  "17": "So I boast in Christ Jesus about the things that pertain to God.",
  "18": "For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in order to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,",
  "19": "in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.",
  "20": "And in this way I desire to preach where Christ has not been named, so as not to build on another person’s foundation,",
  "21": "but as it is written: “ Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”",
  "22": "This is the reason I was often hindered from coming to you.",
