  "12": "The night has advanced toward dawn; the day is near. So then we must lay aside the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.",
  "13": "Let us live decently as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in discord and jealousy.",
  "14": "Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires."
