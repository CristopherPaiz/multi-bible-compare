  "2": "Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever it is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is.",
  "3": "And everyone who has this hope focused on him purifies himself, just as Jesus is pure).",
  "4": "Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; indeed, sin is lawlessness.",
  "5": "And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.",
  "6": "Everyone who resides in him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him.",
  "7": "Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous.",
  "8": "The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil.",

  "22": "and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him.",
