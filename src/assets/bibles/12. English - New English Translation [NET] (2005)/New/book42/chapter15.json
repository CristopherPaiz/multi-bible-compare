  "1": "Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him.",
  "2": "But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”",
  "3": "So Jesus told them this parable:",
  "4": "“Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it?",
  "5": "Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.",
  "6": "Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’",
  "7": "I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.",
  "8": "“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it?",
  "9": "Then when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’",
  "10": "In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”",
  "11": "Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons.",
  "12": "The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will belong to me.’ So he divided his assets between them.",
  "13": "After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle.",
  "14": "Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need.",
  "15": "So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.",
  "16": "He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.",
  "17": "But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger!",
  "18": "I will get up and go to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.",
  "19": "I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers.”’",
  "20": "So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way from home his father saw him, and his heart went out to him; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him.",
  "21": "Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’",
  "22": "But the father said to his slaves, ‘Hurry! Bring the best robe, and put it on him! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!",
  "23": "Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let us eat and celebrate,",
  "24": "because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again — he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.",
  "25": "“Now his older son was in the field. As he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
  "26": "So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening.",
  "27": "The slave replied, ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound.’",
  "28": "But the older son became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and appealed to him,",
  "29": "but he answered his father, ‘Look! These many years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never disobeyed your commands. Yet you never gave me even a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!",
  "30": "But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’",
  "31": "Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that belongs to me is yours.",
  "32": "It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found.’”"
