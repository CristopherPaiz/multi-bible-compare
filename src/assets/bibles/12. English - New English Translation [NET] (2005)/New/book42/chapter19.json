  "1": "Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it.",
  "2": "Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich.",
  "3": "He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd.",
  "4": "So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.",
  "5": "And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because I must stay at your house today.”",
  "6": "So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully.",
  "7": "And when the people saw it, they all complained, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”",
  "8": "But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!”",
  "9": "Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham!",
  "10": "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”",
  "11": "While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.",
  "12": "Therefore he said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.",
  "13": "And he summoned ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business with these until I come back.’",
  "14": "But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’",
  "15": "When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading.",
  "16": "So the first one came before him and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more.’",
  "17": "And the king said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you will have authority over ten cities.’",
  "18": "Then the second one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’",
  "19": "So the king said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’",
  "20": "Then another slave came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina that I put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.",
  "21": "For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’",
  "22": "The king said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! So you knew, did you, that I was a severe man, withdrawing what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow?",
  "23": "Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could have collected it with interest?’",
  "24": "And he said to his attendants, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten.’",
  "25": "But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas already!’",
  "26": "‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.",
  "27": "But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me!’”",
  "28": "After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.",
  "29": "Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,",
  "30": "telling them, “Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.",
  "31": "If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”",
  "32": "So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them.",
  "33": "As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying that colt?”",
  "34": "They replied, “The Lord needs it.”",
  "35": "Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it.",
  "36": "As he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.",
  "37": "As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen:",
  "38": "“ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”",
  "39": "But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”",
  "40": "He answered, “I tell you, if they keep silent, the very stones will cry out!”",
  "41": "Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it,",
  "42": "saying, “If you had only known on this day, even you, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.",
  "43": "For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and surround you and close in on you from every side.",
  "44": "They will demolish you — you and your children within your walls — and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”",
  "45": "Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there,",
  "46": "saying to them, “It is written, ‘ My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers!”",
  "47": "Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him,",
  "48": "but they could not find a way to do it, for all the people hung on his words."
