  "3": "There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’",
  "4": "For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people,",
  "5": "yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’”",
  "6": "And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!",
  "7": "Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?",
  "8": "I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”",
  "9": "Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else.",
  "10": "“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.",
  "11": "The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: extortionists, unrighteous people, adulterers — or even like this tax collector.",
  "12": "I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get.’",
  "13": "The tax collector, however, stood far off and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, be merciful to me, sinner that I am!’",
  "14": "I tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”",

  "21": "The man replied, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.”",
  "22": "When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”",
  "23": "But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.",
  "24": "When Jesus noticed this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!",
  "25": "In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”",
  "26": "Those who heard this said, “Then who can be saved?”",
  "27": "He replied, “What is impossible for mere humans is possible for God.”",
  "28": "And Peter said, “Look, we have left everything we own to follow you!”",
  "29": "Then Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of God’s kingdom",

  "31": "Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.",
  "32": "For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; he will be mocked, mistreated, and spat on.",
  "33": "They will flog him severely and kill him. Yet on the third day he will rise again.”",

  "39": "And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
  "40": "So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him,",
  "41": "“What do you want me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, let me see again.”",
  "42": "Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”",
  "43": "And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they too gave praise to God."
