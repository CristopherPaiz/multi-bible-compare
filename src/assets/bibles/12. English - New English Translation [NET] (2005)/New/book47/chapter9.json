  "12": "because the service of this ministry is not only providing for the needs of the saints but is also overflowing with many thanks to God.",
  "13": "Through the evidence of this service they will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession in the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your sharing with them and with everyone.",
  "14": "And in their prayers on your behalf they long for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown to you.",
  "15": "Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!"
