  "1": "So I made up my own mind not to pay you another painful visit.",
  "2": "For if I make you sad, who would be left to make me glad but the one I caused to be sad?",
  "3": "And I wrote this very thing to you, so that when I came I would not have sadness from those who ought to make me rejoice, since I am confident in you all that my joy would be yours.",
  "4": "For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you.",
  "5": "But if anyone has caused sadness, he has not saddened me alone, but to some extent (not to exaggerate) he has saddened all of you as well.",

  "15": "For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing —",
  "16": "to the latter an odor from death to death, but to the former a fragrance from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?",
  "17": "For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit, but we are speaking in Christ before God as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God."
