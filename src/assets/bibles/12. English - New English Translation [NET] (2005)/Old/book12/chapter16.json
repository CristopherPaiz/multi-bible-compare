  "12": "When the king arrived back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and offered a sacrifice on it.",
  "13": "He offered his burnt sacrifice and his grain offering. He poured out his libation and sprinkled the blood from his peace offerings on the altar.",

  "15": "King Ahaz ordered Uriah the priest, “On the large altar offer the morning burnt sacrifice, the evening grain offering, the royal burnt sacrifices and grain offering, the burnt sacrifice for all the people of Israel, their grain offering, and their libations.

  "16": "So Uriah the priest did exactly as King Ahaz ordered.",
