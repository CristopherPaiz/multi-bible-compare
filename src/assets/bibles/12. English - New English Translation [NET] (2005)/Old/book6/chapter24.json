  "3": "but I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and brought him into the entire land of Canaan. I made his descendants numerous; I gave him Isaac,",

  "5": "I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt down when I intervened in their land. Then I brought you out.",

  "12": "I sent terror ahead of you to drive out before you the two Amorite kings. I gave you the victory; it was not by your swords or bows.",
  "13": "I gave you a land in which you had not worked hard; you took up residence in cities you did not build and you are eating the produce of vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.’",
  "14": "Now obey the LORD and worship him with integrity and loyalty. Put aside the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt and worship the LORD.",
  "15": "If you have no desire to worship the LORD, choose today whom you will worship, whether it be the gods whom your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But I and my family will worship the LORD!”",
  "16": "The people responded, “Far be it from us to abandon the LORD so we can worship other gods!",

  "18": "The LORD drove out from before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. So we too will worship the LORD, for he is our God!”",
  "19": "Joshua warned the people, “You will not keep worshiping the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God who will not forgive your rebellion or your sins.",
