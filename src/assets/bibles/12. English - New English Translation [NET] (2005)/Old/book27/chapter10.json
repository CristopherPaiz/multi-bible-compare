  "1": "In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel (who was also called Belteshazzar). This message was true and concerned a great war. He understood the message and gained insight by the vision.",

  "4": "On the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was beside the great river, the Tigris.",
  "5": "I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen; around his waist was a belt made of gold from Upaz.",
  "6": "His body resembled yellow jasper, and his face had an appearance like lightning. His eyes were like blazing torches; his arms and feet had the gleam of polished bronze. His voice thundered forth like the sound of a large crowd.",
  "7": "Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it. On the contrary, they were overcome with fright and ran away to hide.",
  "8": "I alone was left to see this great vision. My strength drained from me, and my vigor disappeared; I was without energy.",

  "10": "Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees.",
  "11": "He said to me, “Daniel, you are of great value. Understand the words that I am about to speak to you. So stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up shaking.",

  "15": "While he was saying this to me, I was flat on the ground and unable to speak.",
  "16": "Then one who appeared to be a human being was touching my lips. I opened my mouth and started to speak, saying to the one who was standing before me, “Sir, due to the vision, anxiety has gripped me and I have no strength.",
  "17": "How, sir, am I able to speak with you? My strength is gone, and I am breathless.”",
  "18": "Then the one who appeared to be a human being touched me again and strengthened me.",
  "19": "He said to me, “Don’t be afraid, you who are valued. Peace be to you! Be strong! Be really strong!” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened. I said, “Sir, you may speak now, for you have given me strength.”",
  "20": "He said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I am about to return to engage in battle with the prince of Persia. When I go, the prince of Greece is coming.",
  "21": "However, I will first tell you what is written in a dependable book. (There is no one who strengthens me against these princes, except Michael your prince."
