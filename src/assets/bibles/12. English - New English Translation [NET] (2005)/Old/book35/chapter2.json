  "4": "Look, the one whose desires are not upright will faint from exhaustion, but the person of integrity will live because of his faithfulness.",
  "5": "Indeed, wine will betray the proud, restless man! His appetite is as big as Sheol’s; like death, he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations; he seizes all peoples.",
  "6": "“But all these nations will someday taunt him and ridicule him with proverbial sayings: ‘The one who accumulates what does not belong to him is as good as dead (How long will this go on?) — he who gets rich by extortion!’",
  "7": "Your creditors will suddenly attack; those who terrify you will spring into action, and they will rob you.",

  "18": "What good is an idol? Why would a craftsman make it? What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles? Why would its creator place his trust in it and make such mute, worthless things?",
  "19": "The one who says to wood, ‘Wake up!’ is as good as dead — he who says to speechless stone, ‘Awake!’ Can it give reliable guidance? It is overlaid with gold and silver; it has no life’s breath inside it.",
