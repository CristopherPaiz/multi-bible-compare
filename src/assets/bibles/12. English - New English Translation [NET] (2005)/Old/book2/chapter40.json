  "20": "He took the testimony and put it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and then put the atonement lid on the ark.",
  "21": "And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung the protecting curtain, and shielded the ark of the testimony from view, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "22": "And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.",
  "23": "And he set the bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",

  "26": "And he put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain,",

  "28": "Then he put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.",
  "29": "He also put the altar for the burnt offering by the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "30": "Then he put the large basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.",

  "32": "Whenever they entered the tent of meeting, and whenever they approached the altar, they would wash, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "33": "And he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and put the curtain at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.",
  "34": "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.",
  "35": "Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.",

  "37": "but if the cloud was not lifted up, then they would not journey further until the day it was lifted up.",
  "38": "For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, but fire would be on it at night, in plain view of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
