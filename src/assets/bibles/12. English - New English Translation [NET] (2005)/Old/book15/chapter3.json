  "4": "They observed the Festival of Temporary Shelters as required and offered the proper number of daily burnt offerings according to the requirement for each day.",
  "5": "Afterward they offered the continual burnt offerings and those for the new moons and those for all the holy assemblies of the LORD and all those that were being voluntarily offered to the LORD.",
  "6": "From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. However, the LORD’s temple was not at that time established.",
  "7": "So they provided money for the masons and carpenters, and food, beverages, and olive oil for the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar timber from Lebanon to the seaport at Joppa, in accord with the edict of King Cyrus of Persia.",
  "8": "In the second year after they had come to the temple of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak initiated the work, along with the rest of their associates, the priests and the Levites, and all those who were coming to Jerusalem from the exile.
