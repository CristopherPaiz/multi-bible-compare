  "1": "Then Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan liked David very much.",

  "4": "So Jonathan spoke on David’s behalf to his father Saul. He said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you. On the contrary, his actions have been very beneficial for you.",
  "5": "He risked his life when he struck down the Philistine and the LORD gave all Israel a great victory. When you saw it, you were happy. So why would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death for no reason?”",
  "6": "Saul accepted Jonathan’s advice and took an oath, “As surely as the LORD lives, he will not be put to death.”",

  "12": "So Michal lowered David through the window, and he ran away and escaped.",
  "13": "Then Michal took a household idol and put it on the bed. She put a quilt made of goat’s hair over its head and then covered the idol with a garment.",
  "14": "When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, “He’s sick.”",
  "15": "Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed so I can kill him.”",
  "16": "When the messengers came, they found only the idol on the bed and the quilt made of goat’s hair at its head.",
  "17": "Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me this way by sending my enemy away? Now he has escaped!” Michal replied to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away or else I will kill you!’”",

  "24": "He even stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there naked all that day and night. (For that reason it is asked, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”)"
