  "1": "“And you, sing a lament for the princes of Israel,",
  "2": "and say: “‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay among young lions; she reared her cubs.",
  "3": "She reared one of her cubs; he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.",
  "4": "The nations heard about him; he was trapped in their pit. They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.",
  "5": "“‘When she realized that she waited in vain, her hope was lost. She took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.",
  "6": "He walked about among the lions; he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.",
  "7": "He broke down their strongholds and devastated their cities. The land and everything in it was frightened at the sound of his roaring.",
  "8": "The nations — the surrounding regions — attacked him. They threw their net over him; he was caught in their pit.",
  "9": "They put him in a collar with hooks; they brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him to prison so that his voice would not be heard any longer on the mountains of Israel.",
  "10": "“‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by water. It was fruitful and full of branches because it was well-watered.",
  "11": "Its boughs were strong, fit for rulers’ scepters; it reached up into the clouds. It stood out because of its height and its many branches.",
  "12": "But it was plucked up in anger; it was thrown down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit; its strong branches broke off and withered — a fire consumed them.",
  "13": "Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.",
  "14": "A fire has gone out from its branch; it has consumed its shoot and its fruit. No strong branch was left in it, nor a scepter to rule.’ This is a lament song, and has become a lament song.”"
