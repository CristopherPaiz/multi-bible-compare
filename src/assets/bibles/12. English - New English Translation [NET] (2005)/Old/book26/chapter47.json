  "4": "Again he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was now knee deep. Once more he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was waist deep.",
  "5": "Again he measured 1,750 feet and it was a river I could not cross, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.",
  "6": "He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river.",
  "7": "When I had returned, I noticed a vast number of trees on the banks of the river, on both sides.",
  "8": "He said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and flow down into the Arabah; when they enter the Dead Sea, where the sea is stagnant, the waters become fresh.",
  "9": "Every living creature which swarms where the river flows will live; there will be many fish, for these waters flow there. It will become fresh and everything will live where the river flows.",
  "10": "Fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to En-eglaim they will spread nets. They will catch many kinds of fish, like the fish of the Great Sea.",
  "11": "But its swamps and its marshes will not become fresh; they will remain salty.",
  "12": "On both sides of the river’s banks, every kind of tree will grow for food. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail, but they will bear fruit every month, because their water source flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.”",
  "13": "This is what the sovereign LORD says: “Here are the borders you will observe as you allot the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. (Joseph will have two portions.)",
  "14": "You must divide it equally just as I vowed to give it to your forefathers; this land will be assigned as your inheritance.",

  "18": "On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan. You will measure from the border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.",

  "21": "“This is how you will divide this land for yourselves among the tribes of Israel.",
  "22": "You must allot it as an inheritance among yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you, who have fathered sons among you. You must treat them as native-born among the people of Israel; they will be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.",
