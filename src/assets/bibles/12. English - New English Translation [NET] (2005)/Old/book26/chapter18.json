  "8": "does not engage in usury or charge interest, but refrains from wrongdoing, promotes true justice between men,",
  "9": "and follows my statutes and observes my regulations by carrying them out. That man is righteous; he will certainly live, declares the sovereign LORD.",
  "10": "“Suppose such a man has a violent son who sheds blood and does any of these things mentioned previously",
  "11": "(though the father did not do any of them). He eats pagan sacrifices on the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife,",
  "12": "oppresses the poor and the needy, commits robbery, does not give back what was given in pledge, prays to idols, performs abominable acts,",

  "20": "The person who sins is the one who will die. A son will not suffer for his father’s iniquity, and a father will not suffer for his son’s iniquity; the righteous person will be judged according to his righteousness, and the wicked person according to his wickedness.",
  "21": "“But if the wicked person turns from all the sin he has committed and observes all my statutes and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.",
