  "1": "(21:6) The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "2": "“Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and speak out against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel",
  "3": "and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look, I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.",
  "4": "Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from the south to the north.",
  "5": "Then everyone will know that I am the LORD, who drew my sword from its sheath — it will not be sheathed again!’",
  "6": "“And you, son of man, groan with an aching heart and bitterness; groan before their eyes.",
  "7": "When they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you will reply, ‘Because of the report that has come. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand will be limp; everyone will faint and every knee will be wet with urine.’ Pay attention — it is coming and it will happen, declares the sovereign LORD.”",
  "8": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "9": "“Son of man, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord says: “‘A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also polished.",
  "10": "It is sharpened for slaughter, it is polished to flash like lightning! “‘Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? No! The sword despises every tree!",
  "11": "“‘He gave it to be polished, to be grasped in the hand — the sword is sharpened, it is polished — giving it into the hand of the executioner.",
  "12": "Cry out and moan, son of man, for it is wielded against my people; against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered up to the sword, along with my people. Therefore, strike your thigh.",
  "13": "“‘For testing will come, and what will happen when the scepter, which the sword despises, is no more? declares the sovereign LORD.’",
  "14": "“And you, son of man, prophesy, and clap your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times! It is a sword for slaughter, a sword for the great slaughter surrounding them.",
  "15": "So hearts melt with fear and many stumble. At all their gates I have stationed the sword for slaughter. Ah! It is made to flash, it is drawn for slaughter!",
  "16": "Cut sharply on the right! Swing to the left, wherever your edge is appointed to strike.",
  "17": "I too will clap my hands together, I will exhaust my rage; I the LORD have spoken.”",
  "18": "The word of the LORD came to me:",
  "19": "“You, son of man, mark out two routes for the king of Babylon’s sword to take; both of them will originate in a single land. Make a signpost and put it at the beginning of the road leading to the city.",
  "20": "Mark out the routes for the sword to take: “Rabbah of the Ammonites” and “Judah with Jerusalem in it.”",
  "21": "For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road at the head of the two routes. He looks for omens: He shakes arrows, he consults idols, he examines animal livers.",
  "22": "Into his right hand comes the portent for Jerusalem — to set up battering rams, to give the signal for slaughter, to shout out the battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to erect a siege ramp, to build a siege wall.",
  "23": "But those in Jerusalem will view it as a false omen. They have sworn solemn oaths, but the king of Babylon will accuse them of violations in order to seize them.",
  "24": "“Therefore this is what the sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you have brought up your own guilt by uncovering your transgressions and revealing your sins through all your actions, for this reason you will be taken by force.",
  "25": "“‘As for you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of final punishment,",
  "26": "this is what the sovereign LORD says: Tear off the turban, take off the crown! Things must change! Exalt the lowly, bring down the proud!",
  "27": "A total ruin I will make it! It will come to an end when the one arrives to whom I have assigned judgment.’",
  "28": "“As for you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the sovereign LORD says concerning the Ammonites and their coming humiliation; say: “‘A sword, a sword drawn for slaughter, polished to consume, to flash like lightning —",
  "29": "while seeing false visions for you and reading lying omens for you — to place that sword on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of final punishment.",
  "30": "Return it to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in your native land, I will judge you.",
  "31": "I will pour out my anger on you; the fire of my fury I will blow on you. I will hand you over to brutal men, who are skilled in destruction.",
  "32": "You will become fuel for the fire — your blood will stain the middle of the land; you will no longer be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.’”"
