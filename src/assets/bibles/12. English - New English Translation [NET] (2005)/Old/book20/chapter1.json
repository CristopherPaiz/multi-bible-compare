  "1": "The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:",
  "2": "To learn wisdom and moral instruction, and to discern wise counsel.",
  "3": "To receive moral instruction in skillful living, in righteousness, justice, and equity.",
  "4": "To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, and a discerning plan to the young person.",
  "5": "(Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance! )",
  "6": "To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.",
  "7": "Fearing the LORD is the beginning of moral knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
  "8": "Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father, and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.",
  "9": "For they will be like an elegant garland on your head, and like pendants around your neck.",
  "10": "My child, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent!",
  "11": "If they say, “Come with us! We will lie in wait to shed blood; we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.",
  "12": "We will swallow them alive like Sheol, those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.",
  "13": "We will seize all kinds of precious wealth; we will fill our houses with plunder.",
  "14": "Join with us! We will all share equally in what we steal.”",
  "15": "My child, do not go down their way, withhold yourself from their path;",
  "16": "for they are eager to inflict harm, and they hasten to shed blood.",
  "17": "Surely it is futile to spread a net in plain sight of any bird,",
  "18": "but these men lie in wait for their own blood, they ambush their own lives!",
  "19": "Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; it takes away the life of those who obtain it!",
  "20": "Wisdom calls out in the street, she shouts loudly in the plazas;",
  "21": "at the head of the noisy streets she calls, in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:",
  "22": "“How long will you simpletons love naiveté? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?",
  "23": "If only you will respond to my rebuke, then I will pour out my thoughts to you and I will make my words known to you.",
  "24": "However, because I called but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,",
  "25": "because you neglected all my advice, and did not comply with my rebuke,",
  "26": "so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you, I will mock when what you dread comes,",
  "27": "when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, when distressing trouble comes on you.",
  "28": "Then they will call to me, but I will not answer; they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.",
  "29": "Because they hated moral knowledge, and did not choose to fear the LORD,",
  "30": "they did not comply with my advice, they spurned all my rebuke.",
  "31": "Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way, and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.",
  "32": "For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them, and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.",
  "33": "But the one who listens to me will live in security, and will be at ease from the dread of harm."
