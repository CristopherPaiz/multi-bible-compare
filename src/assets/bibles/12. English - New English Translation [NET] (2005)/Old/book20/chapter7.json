  "1": "My child, keep my words and treasure up my commands in your own keeping.",
  "2": "Keep my commands so that you may live, and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.",
  "3": "Bind them on your forearm; write them on the tablet of your heart.",
  "4": "Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding a close relative,",
  "5": "so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.",
  "6": "For at the window of my house through my window lattice I looked out",
  "7": "and I saw among the naive — I discerned among the youths — a young man who lacked wisdom.",
  "8": "He was passing by the street near her corner, making his way along the road to her house",
  "9": "in the twilight, the evening, in the dark of the night.",
  "10": "Suddenly a woman came out to meet him! She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.",
  "11": "(She is loud and rebellious, she does not remain at home —",
  "12": "at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas, and by every corner she lies in wait.)",
  "13": "So she grabbed him and kissed him, and with a bold expression she said to him,",
  "14": "“I have fresh meat at home; today I have fulfilled my vows!",
  "15": "That is why I came out to meet you, to look for you, and I found you!",
  "16": "I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, with richly colored fabric from Egypt.",
  "17": "I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.",
  "18": "Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning, let’s delight ourselves with sexual intercourse.",
  "19": "For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a journey of some distance.",
  "20": "He has taken a bag of money with him; he will not return until the end of the month.”",
  "21": "She persuaded him with persuasive words; with her smooth talk she compelled him.",
  "22": "Suddenly he went after her like an ox that goes to the slaughter, like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare",
  "23": "till an arrow pierces his liver — like a bird hurrying into a trap, and he does not know that it will cost him his life.",
  "24": "So now, sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words I speak.",
  "25": "Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways — do not wander into her pathways;",
  "26": "for she has brought down many fatally wounded, and all those she has slain are many.",
  "27": "Her house is the way to the grave, going down to the chambers of death."
