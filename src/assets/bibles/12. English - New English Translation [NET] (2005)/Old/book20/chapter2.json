  "1": "My child, if you receive my words, and store up my commands within you,",
  "2": "by making your ear attentive to wisdom, and by turning your heart to understanding,",
  "3": "indeed, if you call out for discernment — raise your voice for understanding —",
  "4": "if you seek it like silver, and search for it like hidden treasure,",
  "5": "then you will understand how to fear the LORD, and you will discover knowledge about God.",
  "6": "For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.",
  "7": "He stores up effective counsel for the upright, and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,",
  "8": "to guard the paths of the righteous and to protect the way of his pious ones.",
  "9": "Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity — every good way.",
  "10": "For wisdom will enter your heart, and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.",
  "11": "Discretion will protect you, understanding will guard you,",
  "12": "to deliver you from the way of the wicked, from those speaking perversity,",
  "13": "who leave the upright paths to walk on the dark ways,",
  "14": "who delight in doing evil, they rejoice in perverse evil;",
  "15": "whose paths are morally crooked, and who are devious in their ways;",
  "16": "to deliver you from the adulteress, from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;",
  "17": "who leaves the husband from her younger days, and forgets her marriage covenant made before God.",
  "18": "For her house sinks down to death, and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.",
  "19": "None who go in to her will return, nor will they reach the paths of life.",
  "20": "So you will walk in the way of good people, and will keep on the paths of the righteous.",
  "21": "For the upright will reside in the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,",
  "22": "but the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it."
