  "1": "My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor, and have become a guarantor for a stranger,",
  "2": "if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered, and have been caught by the words you have spoken,",
  "3": "then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself, because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power: go, humble yourself, and appeal firmly to your neighbor.",
  "4": "Permit no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.",
  "5": "Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare, and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, you sluggard; observe its ways and be wise!",
  "7": "It has no commander, overseer, or ruler,",
  "8": "yet it prepares its food in the summer; it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.",
  "9": "How long, you sluggard, will you lie there? When will you rise from your sleep?",
  "10": "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to relax,",
  "11": "and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need like an armed man.",
  "12": "A worthless and wicked person walks around saying perverse things;",
  "13": "he winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, and points with his fingers;",
  "14": "he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart, he spreads contention at all times.",
  "15": "Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly; in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.",
  "16": "There are six things that the LORD hates, even seven things that are an abomination to him:",
  "17": "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,",
  "18": "a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that are swift to run to evil,",
  "19": "a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who spreads discord among family members.",
  "20": "My child, guard the commands of your father and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.",
  "21": "Bind them on your heart continually; fasten them around your neck.",
  "22": "When you walk about, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will talk to you.",
  "23": "For the commandments are like a lamp, instruction is like a light, and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,",
  "24": "by keeping you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.",
  "25": "Do not lust in your heart for her beauty, and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;",
  "26": "for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread, but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.",
  "27": "Can a man hold fire against his chest without burning his clothes?",
  "28": "Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?",
  "29": "So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor’s wife; no one who touches her will escape punishment.",
  "30": "People do not despise a thief when he steals to fulfill his need when he is hungry.",
  "31": "Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over, he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.",
  "32": "A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom, whoever does it destroys his own life.",
  "33": "He will be beaten and despised, and his reproach will not be wiped away;",
  "34": "for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage, and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.",
  "35": "He will not consider any compensation; he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation."
