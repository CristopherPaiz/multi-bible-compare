  "1": "My child, be attentive to my wisdom, pay close attention to my understanding,",
  "2": "in order to safeguard discretion, and that your lips may guard knowledge.",
  "3": "For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,",
  "4": "but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.",
  "6": "Lest she should make level the path leading to life, her paths are unstable but she does not know it.",
  "7": "So now, children, listen to me; do not turn aside from the words I speak.",
  "8": "Keep yourself far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,",
  "9": "lest you give your vigor to others and your years to a cruel person,",
  "10": "lest strangers devour your strength, and your labor benefit another man’s house.",
  "11": "And at the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are wasted away.",
  "12": "And you will say, “How I hated discipline! My heart spurned reproof!",
  "13": "For I did not obey my teachers and I did not heed my instructors.",
  "14": "I almost came to complete ruin in the midst of the whole congregation!”",
  "15": "Drink water from your own cistern and running water from your own well.",
  "16": "Should your springs be dispersed outside, your streams of water in the wide plazas?",
  "17": "Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.",
  "18": "May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in your young wife —",
  "19": "a loving doe, a graceful deer; may her breasts satisfy you at all times, may you be captivated by her love always.",
  "20": "But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of a different woman?",
  "21": "For the ways of a person are in front of the LORD’s eyes, and the LORD weighs all that person’s paths.",
  "22": "The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities, and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.",
  "23": "He will die because there was no discipline; because of the greatness of his folly he will reel."
