  "1": "After Solomon finished building the LORD’s temple, the royal palace, and all the other construction projects he had planned,",
  "2": "the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, in the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon.",

  "4": "You must serve me with integrity and sincerity, just as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations.",
  "5": "Then I will allow your dynasty to rule over Israel permanently, just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’",
  "6": "“But if you or your sons ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, and decide to serve and worship other gods,",
  "7": "then I will remove Israel from the land I have given them, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, and Israel will be mocked and ridiculed among all the nations.",
  "8": "This temple will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by it will be shocked and will hiss out their scorn, saying, ‘Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?’",
  "9": "Others will then answer, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who led their ancestors out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. That is why the LORD has brought all this disaster down on them.’”",
  "10": "After twenty years, during which Solomon built the LORD’s temple and the royal palace,",
  "11": "King Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty cities in the region of Galilee, because Hiram had supplied Solomon with cedars, evergreens, and all the gold he wanted.",
  "12": "When Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the cities Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.",
  "13": "Hiram asked, “Why did you give me these cities, my friend?” He called that area the region of Cabul, a name which it has retained to this day.",

  "17": "Solomon built up Gezer, lower Beth Horon,",
  "18": "Baalath, Tadmor in the wilderness,",

  "21": "Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out completely). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews, and they continue in that role to this very day.",
