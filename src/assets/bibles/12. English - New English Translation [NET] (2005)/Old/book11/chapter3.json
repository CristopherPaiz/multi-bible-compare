  "1": "Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh, king of Egypt; he married Pharaoh’s daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he could finish building his residence and the temple of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem.",
  "2": "Now the people were offering sacrifices at the high places, because in those days a temple had not yet been built to honor the LORD.",
  "3": "Solomon demonstrated his loyalty to the LORD by following the practices of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.",

  "7": "Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in my father David’s place, even though I am only a young man and am inexperienced.",
  "8": "Your servant stands among your chosen people; they are a great nation that is too numerous to count or number.",
  "9": "So give your servant a discerning mind so he can make judicial decisions for your people and distinguish right from wrong. Otherwise no one is able to make judicial decisions for this great nation of yours.”",
  "10": "The Lord was pleased that Solomon made this request.",

  "13": "Furthermore, I am giving you what you did not request — riches and honor so that you will be the greatest king of your generation.",

  "16": "Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.",
  "17": "One of the women said, “My master, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was with me in the house.",
  "18": "Then three days after I had my baby, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one else in the house except the two of us.",
  "19": "This woman’s child suffocated during the night when she rolled on top of him.",
  "20": "She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your servant was sleeping. She put him in her arms, and put her dead son in my arms.",
  "21": "I got up in the morning to nurse my son, and there he was, dead! But when I examined him carefully in the morning, I realized it was not my baby.”",
  "22": "The other woman said, “No! My son is alive; your son is dead!” But the first woman replied, “No, your son is dead; my son is alive.” Each presented her case before the king.",

  "27": "The king responded, “Give the first woman the living child; don’t kill him. She is the mother.”",
  "28": "When all Israel heard about the judicial decision which the king had rendered, they respected the king, for they realized that he possessed supernatural wisdom to make judicial decisions."
