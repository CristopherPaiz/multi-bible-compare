  "1": "Now Boaz went up to the village gate and sat there. Then along came the guardian whom Boaz had mentioned to Ruth! Boaz said, “Come here and sit down, ‘John Doe’!” So he came and sat down.",
  "2": "Boaz chose ten of the village leaders and said, “Sit down here!” So they sat down.",
  "3": "Then Boaz said to the guardian, “Naomi, who has returned from the region of Moab, is selling the portion of land that belongs to our relative Elimelech.",
  "4": "So I am legally informing you: Acquire it before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people! If you want to exercise your right to redeem it, then do so. But if not, then tell me so I will know. For you possess the first option to redeem it; I am next in line after you.” He replied, “I will redeem it.”",
  "5": "Then Boaz said, “When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the wife of our deceased relative, in order to preserve his family name by raising up a descendant who will inherit his property.”",
  "6": "The guardian said, “Then I am unable to redeem it, for I would ruin my own inheritance in that case. You may exercise my redemption option, for I am unable to redeem it.”",

  "14": "The village women said to Naomi, “May the LORD be praised because he has not left you without a guardian today! May he become famous in Israel!",
  "15": "He will encourage you and provide for you when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, has given him birth. She is better to you than seven sons!”",
  "16": "Naomi took the child and placed him on her lap; she became his caregiver.",
  "17": "The neighbor women named him, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed. Now he became the father of Jesse — David’s father!",
