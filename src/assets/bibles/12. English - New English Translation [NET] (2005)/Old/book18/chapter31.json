  "6": "let him weigh me with honest scales; then God will discover my integrity.",
  "7": "If my footsteps have strayed from the way, if my heart has gone after my eyes, or if anything has defiled my hands,",
  "8": "then let me sow and let another eat, and let my crops be uprooted.",

  "10": "then let my wife turn the millstone for another man, and may other men have sexual relations with her.",
  "11": "For I would have committed a shameful act, an iniquity to be judged.",
  "12": "For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction, and it would uproot all my harvest.",
