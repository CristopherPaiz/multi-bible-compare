  "1": "Then Job responded:",
  "2": "“Oh, if only my grief could be weighed, and my misfortune laid on the scales too!",
  "3": "But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea, that is why my words have been wild.",
  "4": "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks their poison; God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.",
  "5": "“Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass? Or does the ox low near its fodder?",
  "6": "Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?",
  "7": "I have refused to touch such things; they are like loathsome food to me.",
  "8": "“Oh that my request would be realized, and that God would grant me what I long for!",
  "9": "And that God would be willing to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and kill me.",
  "10": "Then I would yet have my comfort, then I would rejoice, in spite of pitiless pain, for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?",
  "12": "Is my strength like that of stones? or is my flesh made of bronze?",
  "13": "Is not my power to help myself nothing, and has not every resource been driven from me?",
  "14": "“To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream, and as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams that flow away.",
  "16": "They are dark because of ice; snow is piled up over them.",
  "17": "When they are scorched, they dry up, when it is hot, they vanish from their place.",
  "18": "Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish.",
  "19": "The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams; the traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them.",
  "20": "They were distressed, because each one had been so confident; they arrived there, but were disappointed.",
  "21": "For now you have become like these streams that are no help; you see a terror, and are afraid.",
  "22": "“Have I ever said, ‘Give me something, and from your fortune make gifts in my favor’?",
  "23": "Or ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s power, and from the hand of tyrants ransom me’?",
  "24": "“Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent; explain to me how I have been mistaken.",
  "25": "How painful are honest words! But what does your reproof prove?",
  "26": "Do you intend to criticize mere words, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?",
  "27": "Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless, and auction off your friend.",
  "28": "“Now then, be good enough to look at me; and I will not lie to your face!",
  "29": "Relent, let there be no falsehood; reconsider, for my righteousness is intact!",
  "30": "Is there any falsehood on my lips? Can my mouth not discern evil things?"
