  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "“Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you offer me.",
  "3": "Bear with me and I will speak, and after I have spoken you may mock.",
  "4": "Is my complaint against a man? If so, why should I not be impatient?",
  "5": "Look at me and be appalled; put your hands over your mouths.",
  "6": "For, when I think about this, I am terrified and my body feels a shudder.",
  "7": "“Why do the wicked go on living, grow old, even increase in power?",
  "8": "Their children are firmly established in their presence, their offspring before their eyes.",
  "9": "Their houses are safe and without fear; and no rod of punishment from God is upon them.",
  "10": "Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry.",
  "11": "They allow their children to run like a flock; their little ones dance about.",
  "12": "They sing to the accompaniment of tambourine and harp, and make merry to the sound of the flute.",
  "13": "They live out their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.",
  "14": "So they say to God, ‘Turn away from us! We do not want to know your ways.",
  "15": "Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain if we were to pray to him?’",
  "16": "But their prosperity is not their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!",
  "17": "“How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished? How often does their misfortune come upon them? How often does God apportion pain to them in his anger?",
  "18": "How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff swept away by a whirlwind?",
  "19": "You may say, ‘God stores up a man’s punishment for his children!’ Instead let him repay the man himself so that he may know it!",
  "20": "Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the anger of the Almighty.",
  "21": "For what is his interest in his home after his death, when the number of his months has been broken off?",
  "22": "Can anyone teach God knowledge, since he judges those that are on high?",
  "23": "“One man dies in his full vigor, completely secure and prosperous,",
  "24": "his body well nourished, and the marrow of his bones moist.",
  "25": "And another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted anything good.",
  "26": "Together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover over them both.",
  "27": "“Yes, I know what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.",
  "28": "For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked lived?’",
  "29": "Have you never questioned those who travel the roads? Do you not recognize their accounts —",
  "30": "that the evil man is spared from the day of his misfortune, that he is delivered from the day of God’s wrath?",
  "31": "No one denounces his conduct to his face; no one repays him for what he has done.",
  "32": "And when he is carried to the tombs, and watch is kept over the funeral mound,",
  "33": "The clods of the torrent valley are sweet to him; behind him everybody follows in procession, and before him goes a countless throng.",
  "34": "So how can you console me with your futile words? Nothing is left of your answers but deception!”"
