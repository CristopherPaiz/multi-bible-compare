  "1": "So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes.",
  "2": "Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.",
  "3": "With Job’s three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty.",
  "4": "Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he was.",
  "5": "But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.",
  "6": "So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up: “I am young, but you are elderly; that is why I was fearful, and afraid to explain to you what I know.",
  "7": "I said to myself, ‘Age should speak, and length of years should make wisdom known.’",
  "8": "But it is a spirit in people, the breath of the Almighty, that makes them understand.",
  "9": "It is not the aged who are wise, nor old men who understand what is right.",
  "10": "Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me. I, even I, will explain what I know.’",
  "11": "Look, I waited for you to speak; I listened closely to your wise thoughts, while you were searching for words.",
  "12": "Now I was paying you close attention, yet there was no one proving Job wrong, not one of you was answering his statements!",

  "18": "For I am full of words, and the spirit within me constrains me.",
  "19": "Inside I am like wine which has no outlet, like new wineskins ready to burst!",
  "20": "I will speak, so that I may find relief; I will open my lips, so that I may answer.",
  "21": "I will not show partiality to anyone, nor will I confer a title on any man.",
  "22": "for I do not know how to give honorary titles, if I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me."
