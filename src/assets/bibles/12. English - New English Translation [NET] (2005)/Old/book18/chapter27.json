  "4": "my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will whisper no deceit.",
  "5": "I will never declare that you three are in the right; until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!",

  "20": "Terrors overwhelm him like a flood; at night a whirlwind carries him off.",
  "21": "The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.",
  "22": "It hurls itself against him without pity as he flees headlong from its power.",
  "23": "It claps its hands at him in derision and hisses him away from his place."
