  "1": "“Man, born of woman, lives but a few days, and they are full of trouble.",
  "2": "He grows up like a flower and then withers away; he flees like a shadow, and does not remain.",
  "3": "Do you fix your eye on such a one? And do you bring me before you for judgment?",
  "4": "Who can make a clean thing come from an unclean? No one!",
  "5": "Since man’s days are determined, the number of his months is under your control; you have set his limit and he cannot pass it.",
  "6": "Look away from him and let him desist, until he fulfills his time like a hired man.",
  "7": "“But there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.",
  "8": "Although its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump begins to die in the soil,",
  "9": "at the scent of water it will flourish and put forth shoots like a new plant.",
  "10": "But man dies and is powerless; he expires — and where is he?",
  "11": "As water disappears from the sea, or a river drains away and dries up,",
  "12": "so man lies down and does not rise; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor arise from their sleep.",
  "13": "“O that you would hide me in Sheol, and conceal me till your anger has passed! O that you would set me a time and then remember me!",
  "14": "If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait until my release comes.",
  "15": "You will call and I — I will answer you; you will long for the creature you have made.",
  "16": "“Surely now you count my steps; then you would not mark my sin.",
  "17": "My offenses would be sealed up in a bag; you would cover over my sin.",
  "18": "But as a mountain falls away and crumbles, and as a rock will be removed from its place,",
  "19": "as water wears away stones, and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man’s hope.",
  "20": "You overpower him once for all, and he departs; you change his appearance and send him away.",
  "21": "If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.",
  "22": "Only his flesh has pain for himself, and he mourns for himself.”"
