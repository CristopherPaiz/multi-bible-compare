  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "“Truly, I know that this is so. But how can a human be just before God?",
  "3": "If someone wishes to contend with him, he cannot answer him one time in a thousand.",
  "4": "He is wise in heart and mighty in strength — who has resisted him and remained safe?",
  "5": "He who removes mountains suddenly, who overturns them in his anger;",
  "6": "he who shakes the earth out of its place so that its pillars tremble;",
  "7": "he who commands the sun and it does not shine and seals up the stars;",
  "8": "he alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea;",
  "9": "he makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky;",
  "10": "he does great and unsearchable things, and wonderful things without number.",
  "11": "If he passes by me, I cannot see him, if he goes by, I cannot perceive him.",
  "12": "If he snatches away, who can turn him back? Who dares to say to him, ‘What are you doing?’",
  "13": "God does not restrain his anger; under him the helpers of Rahab lie crushed.",
  "14": "“How much less, then, can I answer him and choose my words to argue with him!",
  "15": "Although I am innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my judge for mercy.",
  "16": "If I summoned him, and he answered me, I would not believe that he would be listening to my voice —",
  "17": "he who crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds for no reason.",
  "18": "He does not allow me to recover my breath, for he fills me with bitterness.",
  "19": "If it is a matter of strength, most certainly he is the strong one! And if it is a matter of justice, he will say, ‘Who will summon me?’",
  "20": "Although I am innocent, my mouth would condemn me; although I am blameless, it would declare me perverse.",
  "21": "I am blameless. I do not know myself. I despise my life.",
  "22": "“It is all one! That is why I say, ‘He destroys the blameless and the guilty.’",
  "23": "If a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks at the despair of the innocent.",
  "24": "If a land has been given into the hand of a wicked man, he covers the faces of its judges; if it is not he, then who is it?",
  "25": "“My days are swifter than a runner, they speed by without seeing happiness.",
  "26": "They glide by like reed boats, like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.",
  "27": "If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression and be cheerful,’",
  "28": "I dread all my sufferings, for I know that you do not hold me blameless.",
  "29": "If I am guilty, why then weary myself in vain?",
  "30": "If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands clean with lye,",
  "31": "then you plunge me into a slimy pit and my own clothes abhor me.",
  "32": "For he is not a human being like I am, that I might answer him, that we might come together in judgment.",
  "33": "Nor is there an arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both,",
  "34": "who would take his rod away from me so that his terror would not make me afraid.",
  "35": "Then would I speak and not fear him, but it is not so with me."
