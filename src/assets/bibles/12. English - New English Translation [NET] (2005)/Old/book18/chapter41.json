  "1": "(40:25) “Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook, and tie down its tongue with a rope?",
  "2": "Can you put a cord through its nose, or pierce its jaw with a hook?",
  "3": "Will it make numerous supplications to you, will it speak to you with tender words?",
  "4": "Will it make a pact with you, so you could take it as your slave for life?",
  "5": "Can you play with it, like a bird, or tie it on a leash for your girls?",
  "6": "Will partners bargain for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "If you lay your hand on it, you will remember the fight, and you will never do it again!",
  "9": "(41:1) See, his expectation is wrong, he is laid low even at the sight of it.",
  "10": "Is it not fierce when it is awakened? Who is he, then, who can stand before it?",
  "11": "(Who has confronted me that I should repay? Everything under heaven belongs to me!)",
  "12": "I will not keep silent about its limbs, and the extent of its might, and the grace of its arrangement.",
  "13": "Who can uncover its outer covering? Who can penetrate to the inside of its armor?",
  "14": "Who can open the doors of its mouth? Its teeth all around are fearsome.",
  "15": "Its back has rows of shields, shut up closely together as with a seal;",
  "16": "each one is so close to the next that no air can come between them.",
  "17": "They lock tightly together, one to the next; they cling together and cannot be separated.",

  "19": "Out of its mouth go flames, sparks of fire shoot forth!",
  "20": "Smoke streams from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning rushes.",
  "21": "Its breath sets coals ablaze and a flame shoots from its mouth.",
  "22": "Strength lodges in its neck, and despair runs before it.",
  "23": "The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm on it, immovable.",
  "24": "Its heart is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.",
  "25": "When it rises up, the mighty are terrified, at its thrashing about they withdraw.",
  "26": "Whoever strikes it with a sword will have no effect, nor with the spear, arrow, or dart.",
  "27": "It regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.",
  "28": "Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones become like chaff to it.",
  "29": "A club is counted as a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance.",
  "30": "Its underparts are the sharp points of potsherds, it leaves its mark in the mud like a threshing sledge.",
  "31": "It makes the deep boil like a cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment,",
  "32": "It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had a head of white hair.",
  "33": "The likes of it is not on earth, a creature without fear.",
  "34": "It looks on every haughty being; it is king over all that are proud.”"
