  "1": "“I am weary of my life; I will complain without restraint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "2": "I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me; tell me why you are contending with me.’",
  "3": "Is it good for you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?",
  "4": "“Do you have eyes of flesh, or do you see as a human being sees?",
  "5": "Are your days like the days of a mortal, or your years like the years of a mortal,",
  "6": "that you must search out my iniquity, and inquire about my sin,",
  "7": "although you know that I am not guilty, and that there is no one who can deliver out of your hand?",
  "8": "“Your hands have shaped me and made me, but now you destroy me completely.",
  "9": "Remember that you have made me as with the clay; will you return me to dust?",
  "10": "Did you not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?",
  "11": "You clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews.",
  "12": "You gave me life and favor, and your intervention watched over my spirit.",
  "13": "“But these things you have concealed in your heart; I know that this is with you:",
  "14": "If I sinned, then you would watch me and you would not acquit me of my iniquity.",
  "15": "If I am guilty, woe to me, and if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head; I am full of shame, and satiated with my affliction.",
  "16": "If I lift myself up, you hunt me as a fierce lion, and again you display your power against me.",
  "17": "You bring new witnesses against me, and increase your anger against me; relief troops come against me.",
  "18": "“Why then did you bring me out from the womb? I should have died and no eye would have seen me!",
  "19": "I should have been as though I had never existed; I should have been carried right from the womb to the grave!",
  "20": "Are not my days few? Cease, then, and leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,",
  "21": "before I depart, never to return, to the land of darkness and the deepest shadow,",
  "22": "to the land of utter darkness, like the deepest darkness, and the deepest shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”"
