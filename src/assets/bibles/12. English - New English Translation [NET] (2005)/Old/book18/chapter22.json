  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
  "2": "“Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit? Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?",
  "3": "Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty that you should be righteous, or is it any gain to him that you make your ways blameless?",
  "4": "Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you and goes to judgment with you?",
  "5": "Is not your wickedness great and is there no end to your iniquity?",
  "6": "“For you took pledges from your brothers for no reason, and you stripped the clothing from the naked.",
  "7": "You gave the weary no water to drink and from the hungry you withheld food.",
  "8": "Although you were a powerful man, owning land, an honored man living on it,",
  "9": "you sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the orphans you crushed.",
  "10": "That is why snares surround you, and why sudden fear terrifies you,",
  "11": "why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.",
  "12": "“Is not God on high in heaven? And see the lofty stars, how high they are!",
  "13": "But you have said, ‘What does God know? Does he judge through such deep darkness?",
  "14": "Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us, as he goes back and forth in the vault of heaven.’",
  "15": "Will you keep to the old path that evil men have walked —",
  "16": "men who were carried off before their time, when the flood was poured out on their foundations?",
  "17": "They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’ and ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’",
  "18": "But it was he who filled their houses with good things — yet the counsel of the wicked was far from me.",
  "19": "The righteous see their destruction and rejoice; the innocent mock them scornfully, saying,",
  "20": "‘Surely our enemies are destroyed, and fire consumes their wealth.’",
  "21": "“Reconcile yourself with God, and be at peace with him; in this way your prosperity will be good.",
  "22": "Accept instruction from his mouth and store up his words in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; if you remove wicked behavior far from your tent,",
  "24": "and throw your gold in the dust — your gold of Ophir among the rocks in the ravines —",
  "25": "then the Almighty himself will be your gold, and the choicest silver for you.",
  "26": "Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and will lift up your face toward God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him.",
  "28": "Whatever you decide on a matter, it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.",
  "29": "When people are brought low and you say ‘Lift them up!’ then he will save the downcast;",
  "30": "he will deliver even someone who is not innocent, who will escape through the cleanness of your hands.”"
