  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?",
  "3": "These ten times you have been reproaching me; you are not ashamed to attack me!",
  "4": "But even if it were true that I have erred, my error remains solely my concern!",
  "5": "If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and plead my disgrace against me,",
  "6": "know then that God has wronged me and encircled me with his net.",
  "7": "“If I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I receive no answer; I cry for help, but there is no justice.",
  "8": "He has blocked my way so I cannot pass, and has set darkness over my paths.",
  "9": "He has stripped me of my honor and has taken the crown off my head.",
  "10": "He tears me down on every side until I perish; he uproots my hope like one uproots a tree.",
  "11": "Thus his anger burns against me, and he considers me among his enemies.",
  "12": "His troops advance together; they throw up a siege ramp against me, and they camp around my tent.",
  "13": "“He has put my relatives far from me; my acquaintances only turn away from me.",
  "14": "My kinsmen have failed me; my friends have forgotten me.",
  "15": "My guests and my servant girls consider me a stranger; I am a foreigner in their eyes.",
  "16": "I summon my servant, but he does not respond, even though I implore him with my own mouth.",
  "17": "My breath is repulsive to my wife; I am loathsome to my brothers.",
  "18": "Even youngsters have scorned me; when I get up, they scoff at me.",
  "19": "All my closest friends detest me; and those whom I love have turned against me.",
  "20": "My bones stick to my skin and my flesh; I have escaped alive with only the skin of my teeth.",
  "21": "Have pity on me, my friends, have pity on me, for the hand of God has struck me.",
  "22": "Why do you pursue me like God does? Will you never be satiated with my flesh?",
  "23": "“O that my words were written down, O that they were written on a scroll,",
  "24": "that with an iron chisel and with lead they were engraved in a rock forever!",
  "25": "As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that as the last he will stand upon the earth.",
  "26": "And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God,",
  "27": "whom I will see for myself, and whom my own eyes will behold, and not another. My heart grows faint within me.",
  "28": "If you say, ‘How we will pursue him, since the root of the trouble is found in him!’",
  "29": "Fear the sword yourselves, for wrath brings the punishment by the sword, so that you may know that there is judgment.”"
