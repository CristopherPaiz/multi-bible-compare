  "1": "After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.",
  "2": "Job spoke up and said:",
  "3": "“Let the day on which I was born perish, and the night that said, ‘A man has been conceived!’",
  "4": "That day — let it be darkness; let not God on high regard it, nor let light shine on it!",
  "5": "Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it; let a cloud settle on it; let whatever blackens the day terrify it!",
  "6": "That night — let darkness seize it; let it not be included among the days of the year; let it not enter among the number of the months!",
  "7": "Indeed, let that night be barren; let no shout of joy penetrate it!",
  "8": "Let those who curse the day curse it — those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.",
  "9": "Let its morning stars be darkened; let it wait for daylight but find none, nor let it see the first rays of dawn,",
  "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes!",
  "11": "“Why did I not die at birth, and why did I not expire as I came out of the womb?",
  "12": "Why did the knees welcome me, and why were there two breasts that I might nurse at them?",
  "13": "For now I would be lying down and would be quiet, I would be asleep and then at peace",
  "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves places now desolate,",
  "15": "or with princes who possessed gold, who filled their palaces with silver.",
  "16": "Or why was I not buried like a stillborn infant, like infants who have never seen the light?",
  "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "There the prisoners relax together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.",
  "19": "Small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.",
  "20": "“Why does God give light to one who is in misery, and life to those whose soul is bitter,",
  "21": "to those who wait for death that does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasures,",
  "22": "who rejoice even to jubilation, and are exultant when they find the grave?",
  "23": "Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in?",
  "24": "For my sighing comes in place of my food, and my groanings flow forth like water.",
  "25": "For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me, and what I feared has come upon me.",
  "26": "I have no ease, I have no quietness; I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”"
