  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
  "2": "“Does a wise man answer with blustery knowledge, or fill his belly with the east wind?",
  "3": "Does he argue with useless talk, with words that have no value in them?",
  "4": "But you even break off piety, and hinder meditation before God.",
  "5": "Your sin inspires your mouth; you choose the language of the crafty.",
  "6": "Your own mouth condemns you, not I; your own lips testify against you.",
  "7": "“Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?",
  "8": "Do you listen in on God’s secret council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "What do you know that we don’t know? What do you understand that we don’t understand?",
  "10": "The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men far older than your father.",
  "11": "Are God’s consolations too trivial for you; or a word spoken in gentleness to you?",
  "12": "Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,",
  "13": "when you turn your rage against God and allow such words to escape from your mouth?",
  "14": "What is man that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?",
  "15": "If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,",
  "16": "how much less man, who is abominable and corrupt, who drinks in evil like water!",
  "17": "“I will explain to you; listen to me, and what I have seen, I will declare,",
  "18": "what wise men declare, hiding nothing, from the tradition of their ancestors,",
  "19": "to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.",
  "20": "All his days the wicked man suffers torment, throughout the number of the years that are stored up for the tyrant.",
  "21": "Terrifying sounds fill his ears; in a time of peace marauders attack him.",
  "22": "He does not expect to escape from darkness; he is marked for the sword;",
  "23": "he wanders about — food for vultures; he knows that the day of darkness is at hand.",
  "24": "Distress and anguish terrify him; they prevail against him like a king ready to launch an attack,",
  "25": "for he stretches out his hand against God, and vaunts himself against the Almighty,",
  "26": "defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield!",
  "27": "Because he covered his face with fat, and made his hips bulge with fat,",
  "28": "he lived in ruined towns and in houses where no one lives, where they are ready to crumble into heaps.",
  "29": "He will not grow rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.",
  "30": "He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots and he will depart by the breath of God’s mouth.",
  "31": "Let him not trust in what is worthless, deceiving himself; for worthlessness will be his reward.",
  "32": "Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.",
  "33": "Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall, and like an olive tree he will shed his blossoms.",
  "34": "For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes.",
  "35": "They conceive trouble and bring forth evil; their belly prepares deception.”"
