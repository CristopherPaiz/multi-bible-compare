  "1": "“But now, O Job, listen to my words, and hear everything I have to say!",
  "2": "See now, I have opened my mouth; my tongue in my mouth has spoken.",
  "3": "My words come from the uprightness of my heart, and my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.",
  "4": "The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "Reply to me, if you can; set your arguments in order before me and take your stand!",
  "6": "Look, I am just like you in relation to God; I too have been molded from clay.",
  "7": "Therefore no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure be heavy on you.",
  "8": "“Indeed, you have said in my hearing (I heard the sound of the words!):",
  "9": "‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean and have no iniquity.",
  "10": "Yet God finds occasions with me; he regards me as his enemy!",
  "11": "He puts my feet in shackles; he watches closely all my paths.’",
  "12": "Now in this, you are not right — I answer you, for God is greater than a human being.",
  "13": "Why do you contend against him, that he does not answer all a person’s words?",
  "14": "“For God speaks, the first time in one way, the second time in another, though a person does not perceive it.",
  "15": "In a dream, a night vision, when deep sleep falls on people as they sleep in their beds.",
  "16": "Then he gives a revelation to people, and terrifies them with warnings,",
  "17": "to turn a person from his sin, and to cover a person’s pride.",
  "18": "He spares a person’s life from corruption, his very life from crossing over the river.",
  "19": "Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed, and with the continual strife of his bones,",
  "20": "so that his life loathes food, and his soul rejects appetizing fare.",
  "21": "His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones, which were not seen, are easily visible.",
  "22": "He draws near to the place of corruption, and his life to the messengers of death.",
  "23": "If there is an angel beside him, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;",
  "24": "and if God is gracious to him and says, ‘Spare him from going down to the place of corruption, I have found a ransom for him,’",
  "25": "then his flesh is restored like a youth’s; he returns to the days of his youthful vigor.",
  "26": "He entreats God, and God delights in him, he sees God’s face with rejoicing, and God restores to him his righteousness.",
  "27": "That person sings to others, saying: ‘I have sinned and falsified what is right, but I was not punished according to what I deserved.",
  "28": "He redeemed my life from going down to the place of corruption, and my life sees the light!’",
  "29": "“Indeed, God does all these things, twice, three times, in his dealings with a person,",
  "30": "to turn back his life from the place of corruption, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.",
  "31": "Pay attention, Job — listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.",
  "32": "If you have any words, reply to me; speak, for I want to justify you.",
  "33": "If not, you listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
