  "3": "gaunt with want and hunger, they would gnaw the parched land, in former time desolate and waste.",
  "4": "By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes, and the root of the broom tree was their food.",
  "5": "They were banished from the community — people shouted at them like they would shout at thieves —",
  "6": "so that they had to live in the dry stream beds, in the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.",
  "7": "They brayed like animals among the bushes and were huddled together under the nettles.",
  "8": "Sons of senseless and nameless people, they were driven out of the land with whips.",
  "9": "“And now I have become their taunt song; I have become a byword among them.",
  "10": "They detest me and maintain their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.",

  "27": "My heart is in turmoil unceasingly; the days of my affliction confront me.",
  "28": "I go about blackened, but not by the sun; in the assembly I stand up and cry for help.",
