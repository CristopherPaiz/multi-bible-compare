  "1": "Then Job answered:",
  "2": "“Even today my complaint is still bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.",
  "3": "O that I knew where I might find him, that I could come to his place of residence!",
  "4": "I would lay out my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.",
  "5": "I would know with what words he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.",
  "6": "Would he contend with me with great power? No, he would only pay attention to me.",
  "7": "There an upright person could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.",
  "8": "“If I go to the east, he is not there, and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.",
  "9": "In the north when he is at work, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I see no trace of him.",
  "10": "But he knows the pathway that I take; if he tested me, I would come forth like gold.",
  "11": "My feet have followed his steps closely; I have kept to his way and have not turned aside.",
  "12": "I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion.",
  "13": "But he is unchangeable, and who can change him? Whatever he has desired, he does.",
  "14": "For he fulfills his decree against me, and many such things are his plans.",
  "15": "That is why I am terrified in his presence; when I consider, I am afraid because of him.",
  "16": "Indeed, God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.",
  "17": "Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness, because of the thick darkness that covered my face."
