  "18": "“O earth, do not cover my blood, nor let there be a secret place for my cry.",
  "19": "Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.",
  "20": "My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;",
  "21": "and he contends with God on behalf of man as a man pleads for his friend.",
  "22": "For the years that lie ahead are few, and then I will go on the way of no return."
