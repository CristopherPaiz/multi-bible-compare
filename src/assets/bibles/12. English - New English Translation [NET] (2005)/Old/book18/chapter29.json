  "1": "Then Job continued his speech:",
  "2": "“O that I could be as I was in the months now gone, in the days when God watched over me,",
  "3": "when he caused his lamp to shine upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;",
  "4": "just as I was in my most productive time, when God’s intimate friendship was experienced in my tent,",
  "5": "when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me;",
  "6": "when my steps were bathed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil!",
  "7": "When I went out to the city gate and secured my seat in the public square,",
  "8": "the young men would see me and step aside, and the old men would get up and remain standing;",
  "9": "the chief men refrained from talking and covered their mouths with their hands;",
  "10": "the voices of the nobles fell silent, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.",
  "11": "“As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me, and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,",
  "12": "for I rescued the poor who cried out for help, and the orphan who had no one to assist him;",
  "13": "the blessing of the dying man descended on me, and I made the widow’s heart rejoice;",
  "14": "I put on righteousness and it clothed me, my just dealing was like a robe and a turban;",
  "15": "I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame;",
  "16": "I was a father to the needy, and I investigated the case of the person I did not know;",
  "17": "I broke the fangs of the wicked, and made him drop his prey from his teeth.",
  "18": "“Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.",
  "19": "My roots reach the water, and the dew lies on my branches all night long.",
  "20": "My glory will always be fresh in me, and my bow ever new in my hand.’",
  "21": "“People listened to me and waited silently; they kept silent for my advice.",
  "22": "After I had spoken, they did not respond; my words fell on them drop by drop.",
  "23": "They waited for me as people wait for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rains.",
  "24": "If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it; and they did not cause the light of my face to darken.",
  "25": "I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I lived like a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners."
