  "17": "And life will be brighter than the noonday; though there be darkness, it will be like the morning.",
  "18": "And you will be secure, because there is hope; you will be protected and will take your rest in safety.",
  "19": "You will lie down with no one to make you afraid, and many will seek your favor.",
  "20": "But the eyes of the wicked fail, and escape eludes them; their one hope is to breathe their last.”"
