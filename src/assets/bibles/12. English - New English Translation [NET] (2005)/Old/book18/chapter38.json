  "8": "“Who shut up the sea with doors when it burst forth, coming out of the womb,",
  "9": "when I made the storm clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band,",

  "13": "that it might seize the corners of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it?",
  "14": "The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features are dyed like a garment.",
  "15": "Then from the wicked the light is withheld, and the arm raised in violence is broken.",

  "19": "“In what direction does light reside, and darkness, where is its place,",
  "20": "that you may take them to their borders and perceive the pathways to their homes?",

  "22": "Have you entered the storehouse of the snow, or seen the armory of the hail,",
  "23": "which I reserve for the time of trouble, for the day of war and battle?",
  "24": "In what direction is lightning dispersed, or the east winds scattered over the earth?",
  "25": "Who carves out a channel for the heavy rains, and a path for the rumble of thunder,",
  "26": "to cause it to rain on an uninhabited land, a desert where there are no human beings,",
  "27": "to satisfy a devastated and desolate land, and to cause it to sprout with vegetation?",
  "28": "Does the rain have a father, or who has fathered the drops of the dew?",
  "29": "From whose womb does the ice emerge, and the frost from the sky, who gives birth to it,",
  "30": "when the waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen solid?",
  "31": "Can you tie the bands of the Pleiades, or release the cords of Orion?",
