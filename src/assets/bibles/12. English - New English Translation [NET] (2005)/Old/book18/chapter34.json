  "1": "Elihu answered:",
  "2": "“Listen to my words, you wise men; hear me, you learned men.",
  "3": "For the ear assesses words as the mouth tastes food.",
  "4": "Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right; let us come to know among ourselves what is good.",
  "5": "For Job says, ‘I am innocent, but God turns away my right.",
  "6": "Concerning my right, should I lie? My wound is incurable, although I am without transgression.’",
  "7": "What man is like Job, who drinks derision like water!",
  "8": "He goes about in company with evildoers, he goes along with wicked men.",
  "9": "For he says, ‘It does not profit a man when he makes his delight with God.’",
  "10": "“Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, from the Almighty to do evil.",
  "11": "For he repays a person for his work, and according to the conduct of a person, he causes the consequences to find him.",
  "12": "Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.",
  "13": "Who entrusted to him the earth? And who put him over the whole world?",
  "14": "If God were to set his heart on it, and gather in his spirit and his breath,",
  "15": "all flesh would perish together and human beings would return to dust.",
  "16": "“If you have understanding, listen to this, hear what I have to say.",
  "17": "Do you really think that one who hates justice can govern? And will you declare guilty the supremely righteous One,",
  "18": "who says to a king, ‘Worthless man’ and to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’",
  "19": "who shows no partiality to princes, and does not take note of the rich more than the poor, because all of them are the work of his hands?",
  "20": "In a moment they die, in the middle of the night, people are shaken and they pass away. The mighty are removed effortlessly.",
  "21": "For his eyes are on the ways of an individual, he observes all a person’s steps.",
  "22": "There is no darkness, and no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves.",
  "23": "For he does not still consider a person, that he should come before God in judgment.",
  "24": "He shatters the great without inquiry, and sets up others in their place.",
  "25": "Therefore, he knows their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.",
  "26": "He strikes them for their wickedness, in a place where people can see,",
  "27": "because they have turned away from following him, and have not understood any of his ways,",
  "28": "so that they caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he hears the cry of the needy.",
  "29": "But if God is quiet, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, then who can see him? Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,",
  "30": "so that the godless man should not rule, and not lay snares for the people.",
  "31": "“Has anyone said to God, ‘I have endured chastisement, but I will not act wrongly any more.",
  "32": "Teach me what I cannot see. If I have done evil, I will do so no more.’",
  "33": "Is it your opinion that God should recompense it, because you reject this? But you must choose, and not I, so tell us what you know.",
  "34": "Men of understanding say to me — any wise man listening to me says —",
  "35": "that Job speaks without knowledge and his words are without understanding.",
  "36": "But Job will be tested to the end, because his answers are like those of wicked men.",
  "37": "For he adds transgression to his sin; in our midst he claps his hands, and multiplies his words against God.”"
