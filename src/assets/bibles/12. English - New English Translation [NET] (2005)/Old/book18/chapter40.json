  "21": "Under the lotus trees it lies, in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh.",
  "22": "The lotus trees conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream conceal it.",
  "23": "If the river rages, it is not disturbed, it is secure, though the Jordan should surge up to its mouth.",
  "24": "Can anyone catch it by its eyes, or pierce its nose with a snare?"
