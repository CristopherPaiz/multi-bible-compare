  "1": "“Does not humanity have hard service on earth? Are not their days also like the days of a hired man?",
  "2": "Like a servant longing for the evening shadow, and like a hired man looking for his wages,",
  "3": "thus I have been made to inherit months of futility, and nights of sorrow have been appointed to me.",
  "4": "If I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise?’, and the night stretches on and I toss and turn restlessly until the day dawns.",
  "5": "My body is clothed with worms and dirty scabs; my skin is broken and festering.",
  "6": "My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle and they come to an end without hope.",
  "7": "Remember that my life is but a breath, that my eyes will never again see happiness.",
  "8": "The eye of him who sees me now will see me no more; your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.",
  "9": "As a cloud is dispersed and then disappears, so the one who goes down to the grave does not come up again.",
  "10": "He returns no more to his house, nor does his place of residence know him any more.",
  "11": "“Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.",
  "12": "Am I the sea, or the creature of the deep, that you must put me under guard?",
  "13": "If I say, “My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,”",
  "14": "then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,",
  "15": "so that I would prefer strangling, and death more than life.",
  "16": "I loathe it; I do not want to live forever; leave me alone, for my days are a vapor!",
  "17": "“What is mankind that you make so much of them, and that you pay attention to them?",
  "18": "And that you visit them every morning, and try them every moment?",
  "19": "Will you never look away from me, will you not let me alone long enough to swallow my spittle?",
  "20": "If I have sinned — what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you set me as your target? Have I become a burden to you?",
  "21": "And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, and you will seek me diligently, but I will be gone.”"
