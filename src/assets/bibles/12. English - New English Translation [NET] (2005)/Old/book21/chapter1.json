  "1": "The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:",
  "2": "“Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher, “Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”",
  "3": "What benefit do people get from all the effort which they expend on earth?",
  "4": "A generation comes and a generation goes, but the earth remains the same through the ages.",
  "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.",
  "6": "The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north; round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.",
  "7": "All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full, and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.",
  "8": "All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it: The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.",
  "9": "What exists now is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing truly new on earth.",
  "10": "Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new!”? It was already done long ago, before our time.",
  "11": "No one remembers the former events, nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen; they will not be remembered by the future generations.",
  "12": "I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
  "13": "I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine all that has been accomplished on earth. I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task that keeps them occupied.",
  "14": "I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth, and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile — like chasing the wind!",
  "15": "What is bent cannot be straightened, and what is missing cannot be supplied.",
  "16": "I thought to myself, “I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem; I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”",
  "17": "So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas; however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind!",
  "18": "For with great wisdom comes great frustration; whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache."
