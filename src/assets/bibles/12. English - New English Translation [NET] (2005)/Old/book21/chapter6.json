  "1": "Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth, and it weighs heavily on people:",
  "2": "God gives a man riches, property, and wealth so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires, yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor — instead, someone else enjoys it! This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.",
  "3": "Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years — even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity — even if he were to live forever — I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than he is!”",

  "5": "though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything, yet it has more rest than that man —",
  "6": "if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity. For both of them die!",
  "7": "All of man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach — yet his appetite is never satisfied!",

  "9": "It is better to be content with what the eyes can see than for one’s heart always to crave more. This continual longing is futile — like chasing the wind.",
  "10": "Whatever has happened was foreordained, and what happens to a person was also foreknown. It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate because God is more powerful than he is.",
  "11": "The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes. How does that benefit him?",
  "12": "For no one knows what is best for a person during his life — during the few days of his fleeting life — for they pass away like a shadow. Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth."
