  "1": "So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth. This is what I saw: The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them; no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.",
  "2": "So I considered those who are dead and gone more fortunate than those who are still alive.",
  "3": "But better than both is the one who has not been born and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.",
