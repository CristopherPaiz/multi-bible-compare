  "3": "You may eat any among the animals that has a divided hoof (the hooves are completely split in two ) and that also chews the cud.",
  "4": "However, you must not eat these from among those that chew the cud and have divided hooves: The camel is unclean to you because it chews the cud even though its hoof is not divided.",

  "10": "But any creatures that do not have both fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams, from all the swarming things of the water and from all the living creatures that are in the water, are detestable to you.",
  "11": "Since they are detestable to you, you must not eat their meat and their carcass you must detest.",
  "12": "Any creature in the water that does not have both fins and scales is detestable to you.",
  "13": "“‘These you are to detest from among the birds — they must not be eaten, because they are detestable: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,",

  "15": "every kind of crow,",
  "16": "the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the long-eared owl, the hawk of any kind,",

  "23": "But any other winged swarming thing that has four legs is detestable to you.",
  "24": "“‘By these you defile yourselves; anyone who touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening,",

  "31": "These are the ones that are unclean to you among all the swarming things. Anyone who touches them when they die will be unclean until evening.",
  "32": "Also, anything they fall on when they die will become unclean — any wood vessel or garment or article of leather or sackcloth. Any such vessel with which work is done must be immersed in water and will be unclean until the evening. Then it will become clean.",
  "33": "As for any clay vessel they fall into, everything in it will become unclean and you must break it.",
  "34": "Any food that may be eaten which becomes soaked with water will become unclean. Anything drinkable in any such vessel will become unclean.",
  "35": "Anything their carcass may fall on will become unclean. An oven or small stove must be smashed to pieces; they are unclean, and they will stay unclean to you.",

  "37": "Now, if such a carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean,",

  "39": "“‘Now if an animal that you may eat dies, whoever touches its carcass will be unclean until the evening.",
  "40": "One who eats from its carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening, and whoever carries its carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.",
  "41": "Every swarming thing that swarms on the land is detestable; it must not be eaten.",

  "45": "for I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, and you are to be holy because I am holy.",
  "46": "This is the law of the land animals, the birds, all the living creatures that move in the water, and all the creatures that swarm on the land,",
  "47": "to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between the living creatures that may be eaten and the living creatures that must not be eaten.’”"
