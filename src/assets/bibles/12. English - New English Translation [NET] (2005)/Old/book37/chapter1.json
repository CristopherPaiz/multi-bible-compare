  "3": "So the LORD spoke through the prophet Haggai as follows:",
  "4": "“Is it right for you to live in richly paneled houses while my temple is in ruins?",
  "5": "Here then is what the LORD who rules over all says: ‘Think carefully about what you are doing.",
  "6": "You have planted much, but have harvested little. You eat, but are never filled. You drink, but are still thirsty. You put on clothes, but are not warm. Those who earn wages end up with holes in their money bags.’”",
