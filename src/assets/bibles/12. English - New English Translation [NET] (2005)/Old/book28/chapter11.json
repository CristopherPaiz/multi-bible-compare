  "1": "When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son, and I summoned my son out of Egypt.",
  "2": "But the more I summoned them, the farther they departed from me. They sacrificed to the Baal idols and burned incense to images.",
  "3": "Yet it was I who led Ephraim, I took them by the arm; but they did not acknowledge that I had healed them.",
  "4": "I led them with leather cords, with leather ropes; I lifted the yoke from their neck, and gently fed them.",
  "5": "They will return to Egypt! Assyria will rule over them because they refuse to repent!",
  "6": "A sword will flash in their cities, it will destroy the bars of their city gates, and will devour them in their fortresses.",
  "7": "My people are obsessed with turning away from me; they call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!",
  "8": "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? I have had a change of heart! All my tender compassions are aroused!",
  "9": "I cannot carry out my fierce anger! I cannot totally destroy Ephraim! Because I am God, and not man — the Holy One among you — I will not come in wrath!",
  "10": "He will roar like a lion, and they will follow the LORD; when he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.",
  "11": "They will return in fear and trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria, and I will settle them in their homes,” declares the LORD.",
  "12": "(12:1) Ephraim has surrounded me with lies; the house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit. But Judah still roams about with God; he remains faithful to the Holy One."
