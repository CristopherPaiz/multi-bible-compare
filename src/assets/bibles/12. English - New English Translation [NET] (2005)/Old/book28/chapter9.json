  "1": "O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly like the nations, for you are unfaithful to your God. You love to receive a prostitute's wages on all the floors where you thresh your grain.",
  "2": "Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people, and new wine only deceives them.",
  "3": "They will not remain in the LORD’s land. Ephraim will return to Egypt; they will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.",
  "4": "They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD; they will not please him with their sacrifices. Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning; all those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean. For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite; it will not come into the temple of the LORD.",
  "5": "So what will you do on the festival day, on the festival days of the LORD?",
  "6": "Look! Even if they flee from the destruction, Egypt will take hold of them, and Memphis will bury them. The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure — thorn bushes will occupy their homes.",
  "7": "The time of judgment is about to arrive! The time of retribution is imminent! Let Israel know! The prophet is considered a fool — the inspired man is viewed as a madman — because of the multitude of your sins and your intense animosity.",
  "8": "The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim on behalf of God, yet traps are laid for him along all of his paths; animosity rages against him in the land of his God.",
  "9": "They have sunk deep into corruption as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their wrongdoing. He will repay them for their sins.",
  "10": "When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. I viewed your ancestors like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season. Then they came to Baal-Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame — they became as detestable as what they loved.",
  "11": "Ephraim will be like a bird; what they value will fly away. They will not bear children — they will not enjoy pregnancy — they will not even conceive!",
  "12": "Even if they raise their children, I will take away every last one of them. Woe to them! For I will turn away from them.",
  "13": "Just as lion cubs are born predators, so Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.",
  "14": "Give them, O LORD — what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry, and breasts that cannot nurse!",
  "15": "Because of all their evil in Gilgal, I hate them there. On account of their evil deeds, I will drive them out of my land. I will no longer love them; all their rulers are rebels.",
  "16": "Ephraim will be struck down — their root will be dried up; they will not yield any fruit. Even if they do bear children, I will kill their precious offspring.",
  "17": "My God will reject them, for they have not obeyed him; so they will be fugitives among the nations."
