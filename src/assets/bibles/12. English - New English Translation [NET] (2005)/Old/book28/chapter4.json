{
  "1": "Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites! For the LORD has a covenant lawsuit against the people of Israel. For there is neither faithfulness nor loyalty in the land, nor do they acknowledge God.",
  "2": "There is only cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery. They resort to violence and bloodshed.",
  "3": "Therefore the land will mourn, and all its inhabitants will perish. The wild animals, the birds of the sky, and even the fish in the sea will perish.",
  "4": "Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else: for my case is against you priests!",
  "5": "You stumble day and night, and the false prophets stumble with you; You have destroyed your own people!",
  "6": "You have destroyed my people by failing to acknowledge me! Because you refuse to acknowledge me, I will reject you as my priests. Because you reject the law of your God, I will reject your descendants.",
  "7": "The more the priests increased in numbers, the more they rebelled against me. They have turned their glorious calling into a shameful disgrace!",
  "8": "They feed on the sin offerings of my people; their appetites long for their iniquity!",
  "9": "I will deal with the people and priests together: I will punish them both for their ways, and I will repay them for their deeds.",
  "10": "They will eat, but not be satisfied; they will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers; because they have abandoned the LORD by pursuing other gods.",
  "11": "Old and new wine take away the understanding of my people.",
  "12": "They consult their wooden idols, and their diviner’s staff answers with an oracle. The wind of prostitution blows them astray; they commit spiritual adultery against their God.",
  "13": "They sacrifice on the mountaintops, and burn offerings on the hills; they sacrifice under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is so pleasant. As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery!",
  "14": "I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery. For the men consort with harlots, they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. It is true: “A people that lacks understanding will come to ruin!”",
  "15": "Although you, O Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty! Do not journey to Gilgal! Do not go up to Beth Aven! Do not swear, “As surely as the LORD lives!”",
  "16": "Israel has rebelled like a stubborn heifer! Soon the LORD will put them out to pasture like a lamb in a broad field!",
  "17": "Ephraim has attached himself to idols; Do not go near him!",
  "18": "They consume their alcohol, then engage in cult prostitution; they dearly love their shameful behavior.",
  "19": "A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings; they will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship."
