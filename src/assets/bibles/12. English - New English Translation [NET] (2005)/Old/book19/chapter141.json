  "1": "O LORD, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me! Pay attention to me when I cry out to you!",
  "2": "May you accept my prayer like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering!",
  "3": "O LORD, place a guard on my mouth! Protect the opening of my lips!",
  "4": "Do not let me have evil desires, or participate in sinful activities with men who behave wickedly. I will not eat their delicacies.",
  "5": "May the godly strike me in love and correct me! May my head not refuse choice oil! Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.",
  "6": "They will be thrown down the side of a cliff by their judges. They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.",
  "7": "As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.",

  "9": "Protect me from the snare they have laid for me, and the traps the evildoers have set.",
  "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I escape."
