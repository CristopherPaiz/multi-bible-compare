  "1": "O LORD, fight those who fight with me! Attack those who attack me!",
  "2": "Grab your small shield and large shield, and rise up to help me!",
  "3": "Use your spear and lance against those who chase me! Assure me with these words: “I am your deliverer!”",
  "4": "May those who seek my life be embarrassed and humiliated! May those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed!",
  "5": "May they be like wind-driven chaff, as the LORD’s angel attacks them!",
  "6": "May their path be dark and slippery, as the LORD’s angel chases them!",
  "7": "I did not harm them, but they hid a net to catch me and dug a pit to trap me.",
  "8": "Let destruction take them by surprise! Let the net they hid catch them! Let them fall into destruction!",
  "9": "Then I will rejoice in the LORD and be happy because of his deliverance.",
  "10": "With all my strength I will say, “O LORD, who can compare to you? You rescue the oppressed from those who try to overpower them; the oppressed and needy from those who try to rob them.”",
  "11": "Violent men perjure themselves, and falsely accuse me.",
  "12": "They repay me evil for the good I have done; I am overwhelmed with sorrow.",
  "13": "When they were sick, I wore sackcloth, and refrained from eating food. (If I am lying, may my prayers go unanswered!)",
  "14": "I mourned for them as I would for a friend or my brother. I bowed down in sorrow as if I were mourning for my mother.",
  "15": "But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together; they gathered together to ambush me. They tore at me without stopping to rest.",
  "16": "When I tripped, they taunted me relentlessly, and tried to bite me.",
  "17": "O Lord, how long are you going to just stand there and watch this? Rescue me from their destructive attacks; guard my life from the young lions!",
  "18": "Then I will give you thanks in the great assembly; I will praise you before a large crowd of people!",
  "19": "Do not let those who are my enemies for no reason gloat over me! Do not let those who hate me without cause carry out their wicked schemes!",
  "20": "For they do not try to make peace with others, but plan ways to deceive those who are unsuspecting.",
  "21": "They are ready to devour me; they say, “Aha! Aha! We’ve got you!”",
  "22": "But you take notice, LORD! O Lord, do not remain far away from me!",
  "23": "Rouse yourself, wake up and vindicate me! My God and Lord, defend my just cause!",
  "24": "Vindicate me by your justice, O LORD my God! Do not let them gloat over me!",
  "25": "Do not let them say to themselves, “Aha! We have what we wanted!” Do not let them say, “We have devoured him!”",
  "26": "May those who want to harm me be totally embarrassed and ashamed! May those who arrogantly taunt me be covered with shame and humiliation!",
  "27": "May those who desire my vindication shout for joy and rejoice! May they continually say, “May the LORD be praised, for he wants his servant to be secure.”",
  "28": "Then I will tell others about your justice, and praise you all day long."
