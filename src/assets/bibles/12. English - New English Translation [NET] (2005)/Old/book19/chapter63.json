  "1": "O God, you are my God! I long for you! My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.",
  "2": "Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you, and witnessed your power and splendor.",
  "3": "Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself, my lips will praise you.",
  "4": "For this reason I will praise you while I live; in your name I will lift up my hands.",
  "5": "As if with choice meat you satisfy my soul. My mouth joyfully praises you,",
  "6": "whenever I remember you on my bed, and think about you during the nighttime hours.",
  "7": "For you are my deliverer; under your wings I rejoice.",
  "8": "My soul pursues you; your right hand upholds me.",
  "9": "Enemies seek to destroy my life, but they will descend into the depths of the earth.",
  "10": "Each one will be handed over to the sword; their corpses will be eaten by jackals.",
