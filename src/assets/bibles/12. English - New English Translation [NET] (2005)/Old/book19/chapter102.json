  "1": "O LORD, hear my prayer! Pay attention to my cry for help!",
  "2": "Do not ignore me in my time of trouble! Listen to me! When I call out to you, quickly answer me!",
  "3": "For my days go up in smoke, and my bones are charred like a fireplace.",
  "4": "My heart is parched and withered like grass, for I am unable to eat food.",
  "5": "Because of the anxiety that makes me groan, my bones protrude from my skin.",
  "6": "I am like an owl in the wilderness; I am like a screech owl among the ruins.",
  "7": "I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof.",
  "8": "All day long my enemies taunt me; those who mock me use my name in their curses.",
  "9": "For I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix my drink with my tears,",
  "10": "because of your anger and raging fury. Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.",
  "11": "My days are coming to an end, and I am withered like grass.",
  "12": "But you, O LORD, rule forever, and your reputation endures.",
  "13": "You will rise up and have compassion on Zion. For it is time to have mercy on her, for the appointed time has come.",
  "14": "Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones, and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.",
  "15": "The nations will respect the reputation of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,",
  "16": "when the LORD rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor,",
  "17": "when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request.",
  "18": "The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations; people yet to be born will praise the LORD.",
  "19": "For he will look down from his sanctuary above; from heaven the LORD will look toward earth,",
  "20": "in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners, and to set free those condemned to die,",
  "21": "so they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion, and praise him in Jerusalem,",
  "22": "when the nations gather together, and the kingdoms pay tribute to the LORD.",
  "23": "He has taken away my strength in the middle of life; he has cut short my days.",
  "24": "I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life! You endure through all generations.",
  "25": "In earlier times you established the earth; the skies are your handiwork.",
  "26": "They will perish, but you will endure. They will wear out like a garment; like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.",
  "27": "But you remain; your years do not come to an end.",
  "28": "The children of your servants will settle down here, and their descendants will live securely in your presence.”"
