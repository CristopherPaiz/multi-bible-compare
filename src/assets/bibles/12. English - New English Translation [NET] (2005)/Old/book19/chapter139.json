  "1": "O LORD, you examine me and know.",
  "2": "You know when I sit down and when I get up; even from far away you understand my motives.",
  "3": "You carefully observe me when I travel or when I lie down to rest; you are aware of everything I do.",
  "4": "Certainly my tongue does not frame a word without you, O LORD, being thoroughly aware of it.",
  "5": "You squeeze me in from behind and in front; you place your hand on me.",
  "6": "Your knowledge is beyond my comprehension; it is so far beyond me, I am unable to fathom it.",
  "7": "Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I flee to escape your presence?",
  "8": "If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there. If I were to sprawl out in Sheol, there you would be.",
  "9": "If I were to fly away on the wings of the dawn, and settle down on the other side of the sea,",
  "10": "even there your hand would guide me, your right hand would grab hold of me.",

  "15": "my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret and sewed together in the depths of the earth.",
  "16": "Your eyes saw me when I was inside the womb. All the days ordained for me were recorded in your scroll before one of them came into existence.",
  "17": "How difficult it is for me to fathom your thoughts about me, O God! How vast is their sum total!",
  "18": "If I tried to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. Even if I finished counting them, I would still have to contend with you.",
  "19": "If only you would kill the wicked, O God! Get away from me, you violent men!",
  "20": "They rebel against you and act deceitfully; your enemies lie.",
  "21": "O LORD, do I not hate those who hate you, and despise those who oppose you?",
  "22": "I absolutely hate them, they have become my enemies!",
  "23": "Examine me, and probe my thoughts! Test me, and know my concerns!",
  "24": "See if there is any idolatrous tendency in me, and lead me in the reliable ancient path!"
