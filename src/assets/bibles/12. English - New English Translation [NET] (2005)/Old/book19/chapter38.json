  "1": "O LORD, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger! Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury!",
  "2": "For your arrows pierce me, and your hand presses me down.",
  "3": "My whole body is sick because of your judgment; I am deprived of health because of my sin.",
  "4": "For my sins overwhelm me; like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.",
  "5": "My wounds are infected and starting to smell, because of my foolish sins.",
  "6": "I am dazed and completely humiliated; all day long I walk around mourning.",
  "7": "For I am overcome with shame and my whole body is sick.",
  "8": "I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.",
  "9": "O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire; my groaning is not hidden from you.",
  "10": "My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me; I can hardly see.",
  "11": "Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away.",

  "17": "For I am about to stumble, and I am in constant pain.",
  "18": "Yes, I confess my wrongdoing, and I am concerned about my sins.",
  "19": "But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous; those who hate me without cause outnumber me.",
  "20": "They repay me evil for the good I have done; though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.",
  "21": "Do not abandon me, O LORD! My God, do not remain far away from me!",
  "22": "Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer!"
