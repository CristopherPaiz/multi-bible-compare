  "1": "Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love! Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts!",
  "2": "Wash away my wrongdoing! Cleanse me of my sin!",
  "3": "For I am aware of my rebellious acts; I am forever conscious of my sin.",
  "4": "Against you — you above all — I have sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. So you are just when you confront me; you are right when you condemn me.",
  "5": "Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.",
  "6": "Look, you desire integrity in the inner man; you want me to possess wisdom.",
  "7": "Sprinkle me with water and I will be pure; wash me and I will be whiter than snow.",

  "16": "Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it; you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.",
  "17": "The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit — O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.",
  "18": "Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her! Fortify the walls of Jerusalem!",
  "19": "Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings; then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar."
