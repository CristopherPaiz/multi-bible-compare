  "1": "In you, O LORD, I have taken shelter! Never let me be humiliated! Vindicate me by rescuing me!",
  "2": "Listen to me! Quickly deliver me! Be my protector and refuge, a stronghold where I can be safe!",
  "3": "For you are my high ridge and my stronghold; for the sake of your own reputation you lead me and guide me.",
  "4": "You will free me from the net they hid for me, for you are my place of refuge.",
  "5": "Into your hand I entrust my life; you will rescue me, O LORD, the faithful God.",
  "6": "I hate those who serve worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD.",
  "7": "I will be happy and rejoice in your faithfulness, because you notice my pain and you are aware of how distressed I am.",
  "8": "You do not deliver me over to the power of the enemy; you enable me to stand in a wide open place.",
  "9": "Have mercy on me, for I am in distress! My eyes grow dim from suffering. I have lost my strength.",
  "10": "For my life nears its end in pain; my years draw to a close as I groan. My strength fails me because of my sin, and my bones become brittle.",
  "11": "Because of all my enemies, people disdain me; my neighbors are appalled by my suffering — those who know me are horrified by my condition; those who see me in the street run away from me.",
  "12": "I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about; I am regarded as worthless, like a broken jar.",
  "13": "For I hear what so many are saying, the terrifying news that comes from every direction. When they plot together against me, they figure out how they can take my life.",
  "14": "But I trust in you, O LORD! I declare, “You are my God!”",
  "15": "You determine my destiny! Rescue me from the power of my enemies and those who chase me.",
  "16": "Smile on your servant! Deliver me because of your faithfulness!",
  "17": "O LORD, do not let me be humiliated, for I call out to you! May evil men be humiliated! May they go wailing to the grave!",
  "18": "May lying lips be silenced — lips that speak defiantly against the innocent with arrogance and contempt!",
  "19": "How great is your favor, which you store up for your loyal followers! In plain sight of everyone you bestow it on those who take shelter in you.",
  "20": "You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men; you conceal them in a shelter, where they are safe from slanderous attacks.",
  "21": "The LORD deserves praise for he demonstrated his amazing faithfulness to me when I was besieged by enemies.",
  "22": "I jumped to conclusions and said, “I am cut off from your presence!” But you heard my plea for mercy when I cried out to you for help.",
  "23": "Love the LORD, all you faithful followers of his! The LORD protects those who have integrity, but he pays back in full the one who acts arrogantly.",
  "24": "Be strong and confident, all you who wait on the LORD!"
