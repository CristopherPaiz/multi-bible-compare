  "3": "They have made their blood flow like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them.",

  "5": "How long will this go on, O LORD? Will you stay angry forever? How long will your rage burn like fire?",
  "6": "Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not pray to you!",
  "7": "For they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his home.",
  "8": "Do not hold us accountable for the sins of earlier generations! Quickly send your compassion our way, for we are in serious trouble!",
  "9": "Help us, O God, our deliverer! For the sake of your glorious reputation, rescue us! Forgive our sins for the sake of your reputation!",

  "13": "Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will continually thank you. We will tell coming generations of your praiseworthy acts."
