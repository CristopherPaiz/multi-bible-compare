  "1": "O God whom I praise, do not ignore me!",
  "2": "For they say cruel and deceptive things to me; they lie to me.",
  "3": "They surround me and say hateful things; they attack me for no reason.",
  "4": "They repay my love with accusations, but I continue to pray.",
  "5": "They repay me evil for good, and hate for love.",
  "6": "Appoint an evil man to testify against him! May an accuser stand at his right side!",
  "7": "When he is judged, he will be found guilty! Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.",
  "8": "May his days be few! May another take his job!",
  "9": "May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow!",
  "10": "May his children roam around begging, asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home!",
  "11": "May the creditor seize all he owns! May strangers loot his property!",
  "12": "May no one show him kindness! May no one have compassion on his fatherless children!",
  "13": "May his descendants be cut off! May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives!",
  "14": "May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the LORD! May his mother’s sin not be forgotten!",
  "15": "May the LORD be constantly aware of them, and cut off the memory of his children from the earth!",
  "16": "For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needy, and killed the disheartened.",
  "17": "He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him. He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.",
  "18": "He made cursing a way of life, so curses poured into his stomach like water and seeped into his bones like oil.",
  "19": "May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on, or a belt one wears continually!",
  "20": "May the LORD repay my accusers in this way, those who say evil things about me!",
  "21": "O sovereign LORD, intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation! Because your loyal love is good, deliver me!",
  "22": "For I am oppressed and needy, and my heart beats violently within me.",
  "23": "I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day; I am shaken off like a locust.",
  "24": "I am so starved my knees shake; I have turned into skin and bones.",
  "25": "I am disdained by them. When they see me, they shake their heads.",
  "26": "Help me, O LORD my God! Because you are faithful to me, deliver me!",
  "27": "Then they will realize this is your work, and that you, LORD, have accomplished it.",
  "28": "They curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, but your servant will rejoice.",
  "29": "My accusers will be covered with shame, and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.",
  "30": "I will thank the LORD profusely, in the middle of a crowd I will praise him,",
  "31": "because he stands at the right hand of the needy, to deliver him from those who threaten his life."
