  "29": "I wish that they were wise and could understand this, and that they could comprehend what will happen to them.”",

  "36": "The LORD will judge his people, and will change his plans concerning his servants; when he sees that their power has disappeared, and that no one is left, whether confined or set free.",
  "37": "He will say, “Where are their gods, the rock in whom they sought security,",
  "38": "who ate the best of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise and help you; let them be your refuge!",
  "39": "“See now that I, indeed I, am he!” says the LORD, “and there is no other god besides me. I kill and give life, I smash and I heal, and none can resist my power.",
  "40": "For I raise up my hand to heaven, and say, ‘As surely as I live forever,",
  "41": "I will sharpen my lightning-like sword, and my hand will grasp hold of the weapon of judgment; I will execute vengeance on my foes, and repay those who hate me!",

  "50": "You will die on the mountain that you ascend and join your deceased ancestors, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and joined his deceased ancestors,",
  "51": "for both of you rebelled against me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the desert of Zin when you did not show me proper respect among the Israelites.",
