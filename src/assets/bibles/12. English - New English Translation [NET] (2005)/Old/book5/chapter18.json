  "1": "The Levitical priests — indeed, the entire tribe of Levi — will have no allotment or inheritance with Israel; they may eat the burnt offerings of the LORD and of his inheritance.",
  "2": "They will have no inheritance in the midst of their fellow Israelites; the LORD alone is their inheritance, just as he had told them.",
  "3": "This shall be the priests’ fair allotment from the people who offer sacrifices, whether bull or sheep — they must give to the priest the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.",
  "4": "You must give them the best of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the best of your wool when you shear your flocks.",
  "5": "For the LORD your God has chosen them and their sons from all your tribes to stand and serve in his name permanently.",
  "6": "Suppose a Levite comes by his own free will from one of your villages, from any part of Israel where he is living, to the place the LORD chooses",
  "7": "and serves in the name of the LORD his God like his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD.",
  "8": "He must eat the same share they do, despite any profits he may gain from the sale of his family’s inheritance.",
  "9": "When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, you must not learn the abhorrent practices of those nations.",
  "10": "There must never be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, anyone who practices divination, an omen reader, a soothsayer, a sorcerer,",
  "11": "one who casts spells, one who conjures up spirits, a practitioner of the occult, or a necromancer.",
  "12": "Whoever does these things is abhorrent to the LORD and because of these detestable things the LORD your God is about to drive them out from before you.",
  "13": "You must be blameless before the LORD your God.",
  "14": "Those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to omen readers and diviners, but the LORD your God has not given you permission to do such things.",
  "15": "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you — from your fellow Israelites; you must listen to him.",
  "16": "This accords with what happened at Horeb in the day of the assembly. You asked the LORD your God: “Please do not make us hear the voice of the LORD our God any more or see this great fire any more lest we die.”",
  "17": "The LORD then said to me, “What they have said is good.",
  "18": "I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them whatever I command.",
  "19": "I will personally hold responsible anyone who then pays no attention to the words that prophet speaks in my name.",
  "20": "“But if any prophet presumes to speak anything in my name that I have not authorized him to speak, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die.",
  "21": "Now if you say to yourselves, ‘How can we tell that a message is not from the LORD?’ —",
  "22": "whenever a prophet speaks in my name and the prediction is not fulfilled, then I have not spoken it; the prophet has presumed to speak it, so you need not fear him.”"
