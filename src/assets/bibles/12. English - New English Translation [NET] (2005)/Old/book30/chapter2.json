  "1": "This is what the LORD says: “Because Moab has committed three crimes — make that four! — I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They burned the bones of Edom’s king into lime.",
  "2": "So I will set Moab on fire, and it will consume Kerioth’s fortresses. Moab will perish in the heat of battle amid war cries and the blaring of the ram’s horn.",
  "3": "I will remove Moab’s leader; I will kill all Moab’s officials with him.” The LORD has spoken!",
  "4": "This is what the LORD says: “Because Judah has committed three covenant transgressions — make that four! — I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They rejected the LORD’s law; they did not obey his commands. Their false gods, to which their fathers were loyal, led them astray.",
  "5": "So I will set Judah on fire, and it will consume Jerusalem’s fortresses.”",
  "6": "This is what the LORD says: “Because Israel has committed three covenant transgressions — make that four! — I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They sold the innocent for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals.",
  "7": "They trample on the dirt-covered heads of the poor; they push the destitute away. A man and his father go to the same girl; in this way they show disrespect for my moral purity.",
  "8": "They stretch out on clothing seized as collateral; they do so right beside every altar! They drink wine bought with the fines they have levied; they do so right in the temple of their God!",
  "9": "For Israel’s sake I destroyed the Amorites. They were as tall as cedars and as strong as oaks, but I destroyed the fruit on their branches and their roots in the ground.",
  "10": "I brought you up from the land of Egypt; I led you through the wilderness for forty years so you could take the Amorites’ land as your own.",
  "11": "I made some of your sons prophets and some of your young men Nazirites. Is this not true, you Israelites?” The LORD is speaking!",
  "12": "“But you made the Nazirites drink wine; you commanded the prophets, ‘Do not prophesy!’",
  "13": "Look! I will press you down, like a cart loaded down with grain presses down.",
  "14": "Fast runners will find no place to hide; strong men will have no strength left; warriors will not be able to save their lives.",
  "15": "Archers will not hold their ground; fast runners will not save their lives, nor will those who ride horses.",
  "16": "Bravehearted warriors will run away naked in that day.” The LORD is speaking!"
