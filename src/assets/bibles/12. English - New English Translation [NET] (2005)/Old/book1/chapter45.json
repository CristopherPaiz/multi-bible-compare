  "5": "Now, do not be upset and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life!",
  "6": "For these past two years there has been famine in the land and for five more years there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.",
  "7": "God sent me ahead of you to preserve you on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.",
  "8": "So now, it is not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me an adviser to Pharaoh, lord over all his household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.",
  "9": "Now go up to my father quickly and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!",
  "10": "You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me — you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything you have.",
  "11": "I will provide you with food there because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise you would become poor — you, your household, and everyone who belongs to you.”’",
  "12": "You and my brother Benjamin can certainly see with your own eyes that I really am the one who speaks to you.",

  "14": "Then he threw himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.",
  "15": "He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After this his brothers talked with him.",
  "16": "Now it was reported in the household of Pharaoh, “Joseph’s brothers have arrived.” It pleased Pharaoh and his servants.",

  "18": "Get your father and your households and come to me! Then I will give you the best land in Egypt and you will eat the best of the land.’",
  "19": "You are also commanded to say, ‘Do this: Take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives. Bring your father and come.",
  "20": "Don’t worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt will be yours.’”",
  "21": "So the sons of Israel did as he said. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he gave them provisions for the journey.",
  "22": "He gave sets of clothes to each one of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothes.",
