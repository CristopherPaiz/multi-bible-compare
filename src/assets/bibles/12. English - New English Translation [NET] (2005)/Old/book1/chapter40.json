  "1": "After these things happened, the cupbearer to the king of Egypt and the royal baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.",
  "2": "Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials, the cupbearer and the baker,",
  "3": "so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined.",
  "4": "The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant, and he served them. They spent some time in custody.",

  "6": "When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were looking depressed.",
  "7": "So he asked Pharaoh’s officials, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”",
  "8": "They told him, “We both had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them.” Joseph responded, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me.”",

  "10": "On the vine there were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.",
  "11": "Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”",
  "12": "“This is its meaning,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches represent three days.",

  "14": "But remember me when it goes well for you, and show me kindness. Make mention of me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison,",

  "20": "On the third day it was Pharaoh’s birthday, so he gave a feast for all his servants. He “lifted up” the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants.",
  "21": "He restored the chief cupbearer to his former position so that he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand,",
