  "22": "Hezekiah said, “What is the confirming sign that I will go up to the LORD’s temple?” [7] Isaiah replied, “This is your sign from the LORD confirming that the LORD will do what he has said: [8] Look, I will make the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz.” And then the shadow went back ten steps. Hezekiah’s Song of Thanks [9] This is the prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and then recovered from his illness: [10] “I thought, ‘In the middle of my life I must walk through the gates of Sheol, I am deprived of the rest of my years.’ [11] “I thought, ‘I will no longer see the LORD in the land of the living, I will no longer look on humankind with the inhabitants of the world. [12] My dwelling place is removed and taken away from me like a shepherd’s tent. I rolled up my life like a weaver rolls cloth; from the loom he cuts me off. You turn day into night and end my life. [13] I cry out until morning; like a lion he shatters all my bones; you turn day into night and end my life. [14] Like a swallow or a thrush I chirp, I coo like a dove; my eyes grow tired from looking up to the sky. O sovereign master, I am oppressed; help me! [15] What can I say? He has decreed and acted. I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief. [16] O sovereign master, your decrees can give men life; may years of life be restored to me. Restore my health and preserve my life.’ [17] “Look, the grief I experienced was for my benefit. You delivered me from the pit of oblivion. For you removed all my sins from your sight. [18] Indeed Sheol does not give you thanks; death does not praise you. Those who descend into the pit do not anticipate your faithfulness. [19] The living person, the living person, he gives you thanks, as I do today. A father tells his sons about your faithfulness. [20] The LORD is about to deliver me, and we will celebrate with music for the rest of our lives in the LORD’s temple.”"
