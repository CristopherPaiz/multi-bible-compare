  "1": "Look, a king will promote fairness; officials will promote justice.",
  "2": "Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from a rainstorm; like streams of water in a dry region and like the shade of a large cliff in a parched land.",
  "3": "Eyes will no longer be blind and ears will be attentive.",
  "4": "The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment and the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity.",
  "5": "A fool will no longer be called honorable; a deceiver will no longer be called principled.",
  "6": "For a fool speaks disgraceful things; his mind plans out sinful deeds. He commits godless deeds and says misleading things about the LORD; he gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite and gives the thirsty nothing to drink.",
  "7": "A deceiver’s methods are evil; he dreams up evil plans to ruin the poor with lies, even when the needy are in the right.",
  "8": "An honorable man makes honorable plans; his honorable character gives him security.",
  "9": "You complacent women, get up and listen to me! You carefree daughters, pay attention to what I say!",
  "10": "In a year’s time you carefree ones will shake with fear, for the grape harvest will fail, and the fruit harvest will not arrive.",
  "11": "Tremble, you complacent ones! Shake with fear, you carefree ones! Strip off your clothes and expose yourselves — put sackcloth on your waist!",
  "12": "Mourn over the field, over the delightful fields and the fruitful vine!",
  "13": "Mourn over the land of my people, which is overgrown with thorns and briers, and over all the once-happy houses in the city filled with revelry.",
  "14": "For the fortress is neglected; the once-crowded city is abandoned. Hill and watchtower are permanently uninhabited. Wild donkeys love to go there, and flocks graze there.",
  "15": "This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven. Then the desert will become an orchard and the orchard will be considered a forest.",
  "16": "Justice will settle down in the desert and fairness will live in the orchard.",
  "17": "Fairness will produce peace and result in lasting security.",
  "18": "My people will live in peaceful settlements, in secure homes, and in safe, quiet places.",
  "19": "Even if the forest is destroyed and the city is annihilated,",
  "20": "you will be blessed, you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams, you who let your ox and donkey graze."
