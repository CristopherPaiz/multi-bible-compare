  "7": "I am the one who forms light and creates darkness; the one who brings about peace and creates calamity. I am the LORD, who accomplishes all these things.",
  "8": "O sky, rain down from above! Let the clouds send down showers of deliverance! Let the earth absorb it so salvation may grow, and deliverance may sprout up along with it. I, the LORD, create it.",
  "9": "One who argues with his creator is in grave danger, one who is like a mere shard among the other shards on the ground! The clay should not say to the potter, “What in the world are you doing? Your work lacks skill!”",

  "15": "Yes, you are a God who keeps hidden, O God of Israel, deliverer!",
  "16": "They will all be ashamed and embarrassed; those who fashion idols will all be humiliated.",
  "17": "Israel will be delivered once and for all by the LORD; you will never again be ashamed or humiliated.",
  "18": "For this is what the LORD says, the one who created the sky — he is the true God, the one who formed the earth and made it; he established it, he did not create it without order, he formed it to be inhabited — “I am the LORD, I have no peer.",

  "22": "Turn to me so you can be delivered, all you who live in the earth’s remote regions! For I am God, and I have no peer.",
  "23": "I solemnly make this oath — what I say is true and reliable: ‘Surely every knee will bow to me, every tongue will solemnly affirm;",

  "25": "All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the LORD and will boast in him."
