  "5": "Then blind eyes will open, deaf ears will hear.",
  "6": "Then the lame will leap like a deer, the mute tongue will shout for joy; for water will flow in the desert, streams in the wilderness.",
  "7": "The dry soil will become a pool of water, the parched ground springs of water. Where jackals once lived and sprawled out, grass, reeds, and papyrus will grow.",
  "8": "A thoroughfare will be there — it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it; it is reserved for those authorized to use it — fools will not stray into it.",

  "10": "those whom the LORD has ransomed will return that way. They will enter Zion with a happy shout. Unending joy will crown them, happiness and joy will overwhelm them; grief and suffering will disappear."
