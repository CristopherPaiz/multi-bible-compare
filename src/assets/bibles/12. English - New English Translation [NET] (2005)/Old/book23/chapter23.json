  "3": "the deep waters! Grain from the Shihor region, crops grown near the Nile she receives; she is the trade center of the nations.",
  "4": "Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea says this, O fortress of the sea: “I have not gone into labor or given birth; I have not raised young men or brought up young women.”",
  "5": "When the news reaches Egypt, they will be shaken by what has happened to Tyre.",
  "6": "Travel to Tarshish! Wail, you residents of the coast!",
  "7": "Is this really your boisterous city whose origins are in the distant past, and whose feet led her to a distant land to reside?",
