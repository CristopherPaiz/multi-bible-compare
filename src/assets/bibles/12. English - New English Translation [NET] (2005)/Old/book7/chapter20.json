  "10": "We will take ten of every group of a hundred men from all the tribes of Israel (and a hundred of every group of a thousand, and a thousand of every group of ten thousand) to get supplies for the army. When they arrive in Gibeah of Benjamin they will punish them for the atrocity which they committed in Israel.”",

  "12": "The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “How could such a wicked thing take place?",

  "30": "The Israelites attacked the Benjaminites the next day; they took their positions against Gibeah just as they had done before.",
  "31": "The Benjaminites attacked the army, leaving the city unguarded. They began to strike down their enemy just as they had done before. On the main roads (one leads to Bethel, the other to Gibeah) and in the field, they struck down about thirty Israelites.",

  "34": "Ten thousand men, well-trained soldiers from all Israel, then made a frontal assault against Gibeah — the battle was fierce. But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was at their doorstep.",
  "35": "The LORD annihilated Benjamin before Israel; the Israelites struck down that day 25,100 sword-wielding Benjaminites.",
  "36": "Then the Benjaminites saw they were defeated. The Israelites retreated before Benjamin, because they had confidence in the men they had hid in ambush outside Gibeah.",

  "38": "The Israelites and the men hiding in ambush had arranged a signal. When the men hiding in ambush sent up a smoke signal from the city,",
