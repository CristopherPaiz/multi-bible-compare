  "5": "He said to the men of Succoth, “Give some loaves of bread to the men who are following me, because they are exhausted. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”",
  "6": "The officials of Succoth said, “You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give bread to your army?”",
  "7": "Gideon said, “Since you will not help, after the LORD hands Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will thresh your skin with desert thorns and briers.”",
  "8": "He went up from there to Penuel and made the same request. The men of Penuel responded the same way the men of Succoth had.",

  "10": "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies. There were about fifteen thousand survivors from the army of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had been killed.",
  "11": "Gideon went up the road of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and ambushed the surprised army.",

  "13": "Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the pass of Heres.",

  "18": "He said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Describe for me the men you killed at Tabor.” They said, “They were like you. Each one looked like a king’s son.”",
  "19": "He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. I swear, as surely as the LORD is alive, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.”",
  "20": "He ordered Jether his firstborn son, “Come on! Kill them!” But Jether was too afraid to draw his sword, because he was still young.",
  "21": "Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Come on, you strike us, for a man is judged by his strength.” So Gideon killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent-shaped ornaments which were on the necks of their camels.",
  "22": "The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us — you, your son, and your grandson. For you have delivered us from Midian’s power.”",
  "23": "Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you.”",
  "24": "Gideon continued, “I would like to make one request. Each of you give me an earring from the plunder you have taken.” (The Midianites had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)",
  "25": "They said, “We are happy to give you earrings.” So they spread out a garment, and each one threw an earring from his plunder onto it.",
