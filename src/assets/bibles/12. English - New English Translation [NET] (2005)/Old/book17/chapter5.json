  "1": "It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.",
  "2": "When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.",
  "3": "The king said to her, “What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!”",
  "4": "Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”",
  "5": "The king replied, “Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.",
