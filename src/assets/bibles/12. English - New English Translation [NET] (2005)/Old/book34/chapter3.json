  "3": "The charioteers will charge ahead; their swords will flash and their spears will glimmer! There will be many people slain; there will be piles of the dead, and countless casualties — so many that people will stumble over the corpses.",
  "4": "“Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute — a seductive mistress who practices sorcery, who enslaves nations by her harlotry, and entices peoples by her sorcery —",
  "5": "I am against you,” declares the LORD who commands armies. “I will strip off your clothes! I will show your nakedness to the nations and your shame to the kingdoms;",

  "7": "Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust; they will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated! Who will lament for her?’ There will be no one to comfort you!”",
  "8": "You are no more secure than Thebes — she was located on the banks of the Nile; the waters surrounded her, her rampart was the sea, the water was her wall.",

  "10": "Yet she went into captivity as an exile; even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her nobility; all her dignitaries were bound with chains.",
  "11": "You too will act like drunkards; you will go into hiding; you too will seek refuge from the enemy.",

  "13": "Your warriors will be like women in your midst; the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies; fire will consume the bars of your gates.",
  "14": "Draw yourselves water for a siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Trample the mud and tread the clay! Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!",
  "15": "There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down; it will devour you like the young locust would. Multiply yourself like the young locust; multiply yourself like the flying locust!",
  "16": "Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven! They are like the young locust which sheds its skin and flies away.",
  "17": "Your courtiers are like locusts, your officials are like a swarm of locusts! They encamp in the walls on a cold day, yet when the sun rises, they fly away; and no one knows where they are.",
  "18": "Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria! Your officers are slumbering! Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains and there is no one to regather them!",
  "19": "Your destruction is like an incurable wound; your demise is like a fatal injury! All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy, for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!"
