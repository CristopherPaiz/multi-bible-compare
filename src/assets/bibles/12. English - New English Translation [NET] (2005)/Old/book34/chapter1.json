  "1": "The oracle against Nineveh; the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:",
  "2": "The LORD is a zealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and very angry. The LORD takes vengeance against his foes; he sustains his rage against his enemies.",
  "3": "The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished. He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm; dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.",
  "4": "He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon withers.",
  "5": "The mountains tremble before him, the hills convulse; the earth is laid waste before him, the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.",
  "6": "No one can withstand his indignation! No one can resist his fierce anger! His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire, boulders are broken up as he approaches.",
  "7": "The LORD is good — indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, and he protects those who seek refuge in him.",
  "8": "But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of Nineveh; he will drive his enemies into darkness.",
  "9": "Whatever you plot against the LORD, he will completely destroy! Distress will not arise a second time.",
  "10": "Surely they will be totally consumed like entangled thorn bushes, like the drink of drunkards, like very dry stubble.",
  "11": "From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the LORD, a wicked military strategist.",
  "12": "This is what the LORD says: “Even though they are powerful — and what is more, even though their army is numerous — nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away! Although I afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.",
  "13": "And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck; I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”",
  "14": "The LORD has issued a decree against you: “Your dynasty will come to an end. I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods. I will desecrate your grave — because you are accursed!”",
  "15": "(2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains! A messenger is proclaiming deliverance: “Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah! Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God! For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you, they have been completely destroyed.”"
