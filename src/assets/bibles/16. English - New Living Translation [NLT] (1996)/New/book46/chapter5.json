  "11": "What I meant was that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a Christian yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Don't even eat with such people.",
  "12": "It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your job to judge those inside the church who are sinning in these ways.",
  "13": "God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, \"You must remove the evil person from among you.\""
