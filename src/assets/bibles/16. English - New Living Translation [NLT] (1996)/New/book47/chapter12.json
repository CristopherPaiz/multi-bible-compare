{
  "1": "This boasting is all so foolish, but let me go on. Let me tell about the visions and revelations I received from the Lord.",
  "2": "I was caught up into the third heaven fourteen years ago.",
  "3": "Whether my body was there or just my spirit, I don't know; only God knows.",
  "4": "But I do know that I was caught up into paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be told.",
  "5": "That experience is something worth boasting about, but I am not going to do it. I am going to boast only about my weaknesses.",
  "6": "I have plenty to boast about and would be no fool in doing it, because I would be telling the truth. But I won't do it. I don't want anyone to think more highly of me than what they can actually see in my life and my message,",
  "7": "even though I have received wonderful revelations from God. But to keep me from getting puffed up, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from getting proud.",
  "8": "Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away.",
  "9": "Each time he said, \"My gracious favor is all you need. My power works best in your weakness.\" So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.",
  "10": "Since I know it is all for Christ's good, I am quite content with my weaknesses and with insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
  "11": "You have made me act like a fool--boasting like this. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these \"super apostles,\" even though I am nothing at all.",
  "12": "When I was with you, I certainly gave you every proof that I am truly an apostle, sent to you by God himself. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you.",
  "13": "The only thing I didn't do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong!",
  "14": "Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don't want what you have; I want you. And anyway, little children don't pay for their parents' food. It's the other way around; parents supply food for their children.",
  "15": "I will gladly spend myself and all I have for your spiritual good, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.",
  "16": "Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But they still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery.",
  "17": "But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you?",
  "18": "When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No, of course not! For we both have the same Spirit and walk in each other's steps, doing things the same way.",
  "19": "Perhaps you think we are saying all this just to defend ourselves. That isn't it at all. We tell you this as Christ's servants, and we know that God is listening. Everything we do, dear friends, is for your benefit.",
  "20": "For I am afraid that when I come to visit you I won't like what I find, and then you won't like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfishness, backstabbing, gossip, conceit, and disorderly behavior.",
  "21": "Yes, I am afraid that when I come, God will humble me again because of you. And I will have to grieve because many of you who sinned earlier have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure."
