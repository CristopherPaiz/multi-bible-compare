  "5": "\"No, we don't know, Lord,\" Thomas said. \"We haven't any idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?\"",
  "6": "Jesus told him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.",
  "7": "If you had known who I am, then you would have known who my Father is. From now on you know him and have seen him!\"",

  "9": "Jesus replied, \"Philip, don't you even yet know who I am, even after all the time I have been with you? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking to see him?",
  "10": "Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I say are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.",
  "11": "Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of what you have seen me do.",

  "21": "Those who obey my commandments are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them, and I will love them. And I will reveal myself to each one of them.\"",
  "22": "Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, \"Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?\"",
