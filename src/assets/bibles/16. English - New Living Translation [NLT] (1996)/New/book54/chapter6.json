  "3": "Some false teachers may deny these things, but these are the sound, wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, and they are the foundation for a godly life.",
  "4": "Anyone who teaches anything different is both conceited and ignorant. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, fighting, slander, and evil suspicions.",
  "5": "These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they don't tell the truth. To them religion is just a way to get rich.",

  "21": "Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness. May God's grace be with you all."
