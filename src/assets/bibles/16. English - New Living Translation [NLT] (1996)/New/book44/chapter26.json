  "1": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, \"You may speak in your defense.\" So Paul, with a gesture of his hand, started his defense:",
  "2": "\"I am fortunate, King Agrippa, that you are the one hearing my defense against all these accusations made by the Jewish leaders,",
  "3": "for I know you are an expert on Jewish customs and controversies. Now please listen to me patiently!",
  "4": "\"As the Jewish leaders are well aware, I was given a thorough Jewish training from my earliest childhood among my own people and in Jerusalem.",
  "5": "If they would admit it, they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion.",
  "6": "Now I am on trial because I am looking forward to the fulfillment of God's promise made to our ancestors.",
  "7": "In fact, that is why the twelve tribes of Israel worship God night and day, and they share the same hope I have. Yet, O king, they say it is wrong for me to have this hope!",
  "8": "Why does it seem incredible to any of you that God can raise the dead?",
  "9": "\"I used to believe that I ought to do everything I could to oppose the followers of Jesus of Nazareth.",
  "10": "Authorized by the leading priests, I caused many of the believers in Jerusalem to be sent to prison. And I cast my vote against them when they were condemned to death.",
  "11": "Many times I had them whipped in the synagogues to try to get them to curse Christ. I was so violently opposed to them that I even hounded them in distant cities of foreign lands.",
  "12": "\"One day I was on such a mission to Damascus, armed with the authority and commission of the leading priests.",
  "13": "About noon, Your Majesty, a light from heaven brighter than the sun shone down on me and my companions.",
  "14": "We all fell down, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to fight against my will. '",
  "15": "\"'Who are you, sir?' I asked. \"And the Lord replied, 'I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.",
  "16": "Now stand up! For I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant and my witness. You are to tell the world about this experience and about other times I will appear to you.",
  "17": "And I will protect you from both your own people and the Gentiles. Yes, I am going to send you to the Gentiles,",
  "18": "to open their eyes so they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and be given a place among God's people, who are set apart by faith in me.'",
  "19": "\"And so, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to that vision from heaven.",
  "20": "I preached first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that all must turn from their sins and turn to God--and prove they have changed by the good things they do.",
  "21": "Some Jews arrested me in the Temple for preaching this, and they tried to kill me.",
  "22": "But God protected me so that I am still alive today to tell these facts to everyone, from the least to the greatest. I teach nothing except what the prophets and Moses said would happen--",
  "23": "that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead as a light to Jews and Gentiles alike.\"",
  "24": "Suddenly, Festus shouted, \"Paul, you are insane. Too much study has made you crazy!\"",
  "25": "But Paul replied, \"I am not insane, Most Excellent Festus. I am speaking the sober truth.",
  "26": "And King Agrippa knows about these things. I speak frankly, for I am sure these events are all familiar to him, for they were not done in a corner!",
  "27": "King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do--\"",
  "28": "Agrippa interrupted him. \"Do you think you can make me a Christian so quickly?\"",
  "29": "Paul replied, \"Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that both you and everyone here in this audience might become the same as I am, except for these chains.\"",
  "30": "Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others stood and left.",
  "31": "As they talked it over they agreed, \"This man hasn't done anything worthy of death or imprisonment.\"",
  "32": "And Agrippa said to Festus, \"He could be set free if he hadn't appealed to Caesar!\""
