  "2": "Timothy was well thought of by the believers in Lystra and Iconium,",
  "3": "so Paul wanted him to join them on their journey. In deference to the Jews of the area, he arranged for Timothy to be circumcised before they left, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek.",

  "9": "That night Paul had a vision. He saw a man from Macedonia in northern Greece, pleading with him, \"Come over here and help us.\"",
  "10": "So we decided to leave for Macedonia at once, for we could only conclude that God was calling us to preach the Good News there.",
  "11": "We boarded a boat at Troas and sailed straight across to the island of Samothrace, and the next day we landed at Neapolis.",
  "12": "From there we reached Philippi, a major city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony; we stayed there several days.",
  "13": "On the Sabbath we went a little way outside the city to a riverbank, where we supposed that some people met for prayer, and we sat down to speak with some women who had come together.",

  "15": "She was baptized along with other members of her household, and she asked us to be her guests. \"If you agree that I am faithful to the Lord,\" she said, \"come and stay at my home.\" And she urged us until we did.",

  "22": "A mob quickly formed against Paul and Silas, and the city officials ordered them stripped and beaten with wooden rods.",
  "23": "They were severely beaten, and then they were thrown into prison. The jailer was ordered to make sure they didn't escape.",
  "24": "So he took no chances but put them into the inner dungeon and clamped their feet in the stocks.",
  "25": "Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.",
  "26": "Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, and the prison was shaken to its foundations. All the doors flew open, and the chains of every prisoner fell off!",
  "27": "The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open. He assumed the prisoners had escaped, so he drew his sword to kill himself.",
  "28": "But Paul shouted to him, \"Don't do it! We are all here!\"",
  "29": "Trembling with fear, the jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell down before Paul and Silas.",
  "30": "He brought them out and asked, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\"",
  "31": "They replied, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with your entire household.\"",

  "33": "That same hour the jailer washed their wounds, and he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized.",
  "34": "Then he brought them into his house and set a meal before them. He and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God.",
  "35": "The next morning the city officials sent the police to tell the jailer, \"Let those men go!\"",
  "36": "So the jailer told Paul, \"You and Silas are free to leave. Go in peace.\"",
  "37": "But Paul replied, \"They have publicly beaten us without trial and jailed us--and we are Roman citizens. So now they want us to leave secretly? Certainly not! Let them come themselves to release us!\"",
  "38": "When the police made their report, the city officials were alarmed to learn that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.",
