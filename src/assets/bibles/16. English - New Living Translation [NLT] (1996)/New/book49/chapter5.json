  "1": "Follow God's example in everything you do, because you are his dear children.",
  "2": "Live a life filled with love for others, following the example of Christ, who loved you and gave himself as a sacrifice to take away your sins. And God was pleased, because that sacrifice was like sweet perfume to him.",
  "3": "Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God's people.",
  "4": "Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes--these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.",
  "5": "You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is really an idolater who worships the things of this world.",
  "6": "Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the terrible anger of God comes upon all those who disobey him.",
  "7": "Don't participate in the things these people do.",
  "8": "For though your hearts were once full of darkness, now you are full of light from the Lord, and your behavior should show it!",
  "9": "For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.",
  "10": "Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.",
  "11": "Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, rebuke and expose them.",
  "12": "It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.",
  "13": "But when the light shines on them, it becomes clear how evil these things are.",
  "14": "And where your light shines, it will expose their evil deeds. This is why it is said, \"Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will give you light.\"",

  "16": "Make the most of every opportunity for doing good in these evil days.",
  "17": "Don't act thoughtlessly, but try to understand what the Lord wants you to do.",
  "18": "Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, let the Holy Spirit fill and control you.",
  "19": "Then you will sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, making music to the Lord in your hearts.",
  "20": "And you will always give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "21": "And further, you will submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.",
  "22": "You wives will submit to your husbands as you do to the Lord.",
  "23": "For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of his body, the church; he gave his life to be her Savior.",
  "24": "As the church submits to Christ, so you wives must submit to your husbands in everything.",
  "25": "And you husbands must love your wives with the same love Christ showed the church. He gave up his life for her",
  "26": "to make her holy and clean, washed by baptism and God's word.",
  "27": "He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault.",
  "28": "In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man is actually loving himself when he loves his wife.",
  "29": "No one hates his own body but lovingly cares for it, just as Christ cares for his body, which is the church.",
  "30": "And we are his body.",
  "31": "As the Scriptures say, \"A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.\"",
  "32": "This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one.",
  "33": "So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
