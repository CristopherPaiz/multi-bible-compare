  "1": "Once you were dead, doomed forever because of your many sins.",
  "2": "You used to live just like the rest of the world, full of sin, obeying Satan, the mighty prince of the power of the air. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.",
  "3": "All of us used to live that way, following the passions and desires of our evil nature. We were born with an evil nature, and we were under God's anger just like everyone else.",
  "4": "But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so very much,",
  "5": "that even while we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God's special favor that you have been saved!)",
  "6": "For he raised us from the dead along with Christ, and we are seated with him in the heavenly realms--all because we are one with Christ Jesus.",
  "7": "And so God can always point to us as examples of the incredible wealth of his favor and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us through Christ Jesus.",

  "13": "But now you belong to Christ Jesus. Though you once were far away from God, now you have been brought near to him because of the blood of Christ.",

  "19": "So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God's holy people. You are members of God's family.",
  "20": "We are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself.",
  "21": "We who believe are carefully joined together, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.",
  "22": "Through him you Gentiles are also joined together as part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit."
