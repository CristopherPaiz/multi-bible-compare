  "3": "His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.",
  "4": "The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.",
  "5": "Then the angel spoke to the women. \"Don't be afraid!\" he said. \"I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
  "6": "He isn't here! He has been raised from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying.",
  "7": "And now, go quickly and tell his disciples he has been raised from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember, I have told you.\"",
