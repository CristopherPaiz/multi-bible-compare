  "3": "This great choir sang a wonderful new song in front of the throne of God and before the four living beings and the twenty-four elders. And no one could learn this song except those 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.",
  "4": "For they are spiritually undefiled, pure as virgins, following the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among the people on the earth as a special offering to God and to the Lamb.",

  "7": "\"Fear God,\" he shouted. \"Give glory to him. For the time has come when he will sit as judge. Worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all the springs of water.\"",

  "9": "Then a third angel followed them, shouting, \"Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or the hand",

  "13": "And I heard a voice from heaven saying, \"Write this down: Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed indeed, for they will rest from all their toils and trials; for their good deeds follow them!\"",

  "18": "Then another angel, who has power to destroy the world with fire, shouted to the angel with the sickle, \"Use your sickle now to gather the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for they are fully ripe for judgment.\"",
