  "15": "\"Why have you let all the women live?\" he demanded.",

  "22": "Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead--",
  "23": "that is, metals that do not burn--must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure. These metal objects must then be further purified with the water of purification. But everything that burns must be purified by the water alone.",
  "24": "On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified. Then you may return to the camp.\"",
  "25": "And the LORD said to Moses,",
  "26": "\"You and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of each tribe are to make a list of all the plunder taken in the battle, including the people and animals.",

  "33": "72,000 cattle,",
  "34": "61,000 donkeys,",

  "38": "36,000 cattle, of which 72 were the LORD's share;",

  "48": "Then all the military commanders came to Moses",
  "49": "and said, \"Sir, we have accounted for all the men who went out to battle under our command; not one of us is missing!",
