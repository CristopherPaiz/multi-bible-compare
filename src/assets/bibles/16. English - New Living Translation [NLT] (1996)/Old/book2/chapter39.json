  "2": "The ephod was made from fine linen cloth and embroidered with gold thread and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.",
  "3": "A skilled craftsman made gold thread by beating gold into thin sheets and cutting it into fine strips. He then embroidered it into the linen with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.",
  "4": "They made two shoulder-pieces for the ephod, which were attached to its corners so it could be tied down.",
  "5": "They also made an elaborate woven sash of the same materials: fine linen cloth; blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; and gold thread, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "6": "The two onyx stones, attached to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, were set in gold filigree. The stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, just as initials are engraved on a seal.",
  "7": "These stones served as reminders to the LORD concerning the people of Israel. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",

  "19": "Two more gold rings were attached to the lower inside corners of the chestpiece next to the ephod.",
  "20": "Then two gold rings were attached to the ephod near the sash.",
  "21": "Blue cords were used to attach the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod. In this way, the chestpiece was held securely to the ephod above the beautiful sash. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "22": "The robe of the ephod was woven entirely of blue yarn,",
  "23": "with an opening for Aaron's head in the middle of it. The edge of this opening was reinforced with a woven collar, so it would not tear.",
  "24": "Pomegranates were attached to the bottom edge of the robe. These were finely crafted of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.",
  "25": "Bells of pure gold were placed between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe,",

  "29": "The sashes were made of fine linen cloth and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",

  "31": "This medallion was tied to the turban with a blue cord, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "32": "And so at last the Tabernacle was finished. The Israelites had done everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.",
  "33": "And they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses: the sacred tent with all its furnishings, the clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;",
  "34": "the layers of tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather; the inner curtain that enclosed the Most Holy Place;",
  "35": "the Ark of the Covenant and its carrying poles; the Ark's cover--the place of atonement;",
  "36": "the table and all its utensils; the Bread of the Presence;",
  "37": "the gold lampstand and its accessories; the lamp cups and the oil for lighting;",
  "38": "the gold altar; the anointing oil; the fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the sacred tent;",
