  "35": "Moses was no longer able to enter the Tabernacle because the cloud had settled down over it, and the Tabernacle was filled with the awesome glory of the LORD.",
  "36": "Now whenever the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle and moved, the people of Israel would set out on their journey, following it.",
  "37": "But if the cloud stayed, they would stay until it moved again.",
  "38": "The cloud of the LORD rested on the Tabernacle during the day, and at night there was fire in the cloud so all the people of Israel could see it. This continued throughout all their journeys."
