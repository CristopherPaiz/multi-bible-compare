  "1": "When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings who lived along the Mediterranean coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan River so the people of Israel could cross, they lost heart and were paralyzed with fear.",
  "2": "At that time the LORD told Joshua, \"Use knives of flint to make the Israelites a circumcised people again.\"",
  "3": "So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the entire male population of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.",
  "4": "Joshua had to circumcise them because all the men who were old enough to bear arms when they left Egypt had died in the wilderness.",
  "5": "Those who left Egypt had all been circumcised, but none of those born after the Exodus, during the years in the wilderness, had been circumcised.",
  "6": "The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until all the men who were old enough to bear arms when they left Egypt had died. For they had disobeyed the LORD, and the LORD vowed he would not let them enter the land he had sworn to give us--a land flowing with milk and honey.",
  "7": "So Joshua circumcised their sons who had not been circumcised on the way to the Promised Land--those who had grown up to take their fathers' places.",

  "11": "The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land.",
  "12": "No manna appeared that day, and it was never seen again. So from that time on the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.",

  "14": "\"Neither one,\" he replied. \"I am commander of the LORD's army.\" At this, Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence. \"I am at your command,\" Joshua said. \"What do you want your servant to do?\"",
  "15": "The commander of the LORD's army replied, \"Take off your sandals, for this is holy ground.\" And Joshua did as he was told."
