  "3": "This is what the LORD says: \"The people of Damascus have sinned again and again, and I will not forget it. I will not let them go unpunished any longer! They beat down my people in Gilead as grain is threshed with threshing sledges of iron.",
  "4": "So I will send down fire on King Hazael's palace, and the fortresses of King Ben-hadad will be destroyed.",

  "6": "This is what the LORD says: \"The people of Gaza have sinned again and again, and I will not forget it. I will not let them go unpunished any longer! They sent my people into exile, selling them as slaves in Edom.",
  "7": "So I will send down fire on the walls of Gaza, and all its fortresses will be destroyed.",
  "8": "I will slaughter the people of Ashdod and destroy the king of Ashkelon. Then I will turn to attack Ekron, and the few Philistines still left will be killed. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken!\"",

  "10": "So I will send down fire on the walls of Tyre, and all its fortresses will be destroyed.\"",
  "11": "This is what the LORD says: \"The people of Edom have sinned again and again, and I will not forget it. I will not let them go unpunished any longer! They chased down their relatives, the Israelites, with swords. They showed them no mercy and were unrelenting in their anger.",
  "12": "So I will send down fire on Teman, and the fortresses of Bozrah will be destroyed.\"",
  "13": "This is what the LORD says: \"The people of Ammon have sinned again and again, and I will not forget it. I will not let them go unpunished any longer! When they attacked Gilead to extend their borders, they committed cruel crimes, ripping open pregnant women with their swords.",
  "14": "So I will send down fire on the walls of Rabbah, and all its fortresses will be destroyed. There will be wild shouts during the battle, swirling like a whirlwind in a mighty storm.",
  "15": "And their king and his princes will go into exile together. I, the LORD, have spoken!\""
