  "1": "My child, if you co-sign a loan for a friend or guarantee the debt of someone you hardly know--",
  "2": "if you have trapped yourself by your agreement and are caught by what you said--",
  "3": "quick, get out of it if you possibly can! You have placed yourself at your friend's mercy. Now swallow your pride; go and beg to have your name erased.",
  "4": "Don't put it off. Do it now! Don't rest until you do.",
  "5": "Save yourself like a deer escaping from a hunter, like a bird fleeing from a net.",
  "6": "Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones. Learn from their ways and be wise!",
  "7": "Even though they have no prince, governor, or ruler to make them work,",
  "8": "they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter.",
  "9": "But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep? When will you wake up? I want you to learn this lesson:",
  "10": "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--",
  "11": "and poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.",
  "12": "Here is a description of worthless and wicked people: They are constant liars,",
  "13": "signaling their true intentions to their friends by making signs with their eyes and feet and fingers.",
  "14": "Their perverted hearts plot evil. They stir up trouble constantly.",
  "15": "But they will be destroyed suddenly, broken beyond all hope of healing.",
  "16": "There are six things the LORD hates--no, seven things he detests:",
  "17": "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent,",
  "18": "a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong,",
  "19": "a false witness who pours out lies, a person who sows discord among brothers.",
  "20": "My son, obey your father's commands, and don't neglect your mother's teaching.",
  "21": "Keep their words always in your heart. Tie them around your neck.",
  "22": "Wherever you walk, their counsel can lead you. When you sleep, they will protect you. When you wake up in the morning, they will advise you.",
  "23": "For these commands and this teaching are a lamp to light the way ahead of you. The correction of discipline is the way to life.",
  "24": "These commands and this teaching will keep you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of an adulterous woman.",
  "25": "Don't lust for her beauty. Don't let her coyness seduce you.",
  "26": "For a prostitute will bring you to poverty, and sleeping with another man's wife may cost you your very life.",
  "27": "Can a man scoop fire into his lap and not be burned?",
  "28": "Can he walk on hot coals and not blister his feet?",
  "29": "So it is with the man who sleeps with another man's wife. He who embraces her will not go unpunished.",
  "30": "Excuses might be found for a thief who steals because he is starving.",
  "31": "But if he is caught, he will be fined seven times as much as he stole, even if it means selling everything in his house to pay it back.",
  "32": "But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool, for he destroys his own soul.",
  "33": "Wounds and constant disgrace are his lot. His shame will never be erased.",
  "34": "For the woman's husband will be furious in his jealousy, and he will have no mercy in his day of vengeance.",
  "35": "There is no compensation or bribe that will satisfy him."
