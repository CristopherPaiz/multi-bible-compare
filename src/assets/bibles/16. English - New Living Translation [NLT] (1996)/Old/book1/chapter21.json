  "9": "But Sarah saw Ishmael--the son of Abraham and her Egyptian servant Hagar--making fun of Isaac.",
  "10": "So she turned to Abraham and demanded, \"Get rid of that servant and her son. He is not going to share the family inheritance with my son, Isaac. I won't have it!\"",
  "11": "This upset Abraham very much because Ishmael was his son.",
  "12": "But God told Abraham, \"Do not be upset over the boy and your servant wife. Do just as Sarah says, for Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.",
  "13": "But I will make a nation of the descendants of Hagar's son because he also is your son.\"",
