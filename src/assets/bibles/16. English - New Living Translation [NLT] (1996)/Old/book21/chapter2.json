  "1": "I said to myself, \"Come now, let's give pleasure a try. Let's look for the `good things' in life.\" But I found that this, too, was meaningless.",
  "2": "\"It is silly to be laughing all the time,\" I said. \"What good does it do to seek only pleasure?\"",
  "3": "After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. While still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I hoped to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.",
  "4": "I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.",
  "5": "I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.",
  "6": "I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.",
  "7": "I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned great herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who lived in Jerusalem before me.",
  "8": "I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!",
  "9": "So I became greater than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. And with it all, I remained clear-eyed so that I could evaluate all these things.",
  "10": "Anything I wanted, I took. I did not restrain myself from any joy. I even found great pleasure in hard work, an additional reward for all my labors.",
  "11": "But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless. It was like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere.",
  "12": "So I decided to compare wisdom and folly, and anyone else would come to the same conclusions I did.",
  "13": "Wisdom is of more value than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.",
  "14": "For the wise person sees, while the fool is blind. Yet I saw that wise and foolish people share the same fate.",
  "15": "Both of them die. Just as the fool will die, so will I. So of what value is all my wisdom? Then I said to myself, \"This is all so meaningless!\"",
  "16": "For the wise person and the fool both die, and in the days to come, both will be forgotten.",
  "17": "So now I hate life because everything done here under the sun is so irrational. Everything is meaningless, like chasing the wind.",
  "18": "I am disgusted that I must leave the fruits of my hard work to others.",
  "19": "And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? And yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work. How meaningless!",
  "20": "So I turned in despair from hard work. It was not the answer to my search for satisfaction in this life.",
  "21": "For though I do my work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, I must leave everything I gain to people who haven't worked to earn it. This is not only foolish but highly unfair.",
  "22": "So what do people get for all their hard work?",
  "23": "Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night they cannot rest. It is all utterly meaningless.",
  "24": "So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that this pleasure is from the hand of God.",
  "25": "For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?",
  "26": "God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. Even this, however, is meaningless, like chasing the wind."
