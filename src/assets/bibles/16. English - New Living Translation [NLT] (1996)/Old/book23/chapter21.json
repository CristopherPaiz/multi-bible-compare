  "5": "Look! They are preparing a great feast. They are spreading rugs for people to sit on. Everyone is eating and drinking. Quick! Grab your shields and prepare for battle! You are being attacked!",

  "14": "O people of Tema, bring food and water to these weary refugees.",
  "15": "They have fled from drawn swords and sharp arrows and the terrors of war.",
  "16": "\"But within a year,\" says the Lord, \"all the glory of Kedar will come to an end.",
  "17": "Only a few of its courageous archers will survive. I, the LORD, the God of Israel, have spoken!\""
