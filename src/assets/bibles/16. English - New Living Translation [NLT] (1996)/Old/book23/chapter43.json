  "1": "But now, O Israel, the LORD who created you says: \"Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are mine.",
  "2": "When you go through deep waters and great trouble, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown! When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.",
  "3": "For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba as a ransom for your freedom.",
  "4": "Others died that you might live. I traded their lives for yours because you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you.",
  "5": "\"Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will gather you and your children from east and west",
  "6": "and from north and south. I will bring my sons and daughters back to Israel from the distant corners of the earth.",
  "7": "All who claim me as their God will come, for I have made them for my glory. It was I who created them.\"",
  "8": "Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf.",
  "9": "Gather the nations together! Which of their idols has ever foretold such things? Can any of them predict something even a single day in advance? Where are the witnesses of such predictions? Who can verify that they spoke the truth?",
  "10": "\"But you are my witnesses, O Israel!\" says the LORD. \"And you are my servant. You have been chosen to know me, believe in me, and understand that I alone am God. There is no other God; there never has been and never will be.",
  "11": "I am the LORD, and there is no other Savior.",
  "12": "First I predicted your deliverance; I declared what I would do, and then I did it--I saved you. No foreign god has ever done this before. You are witnesses that I am the only God,\" says the LORD.",
  "13": "\"From eternity to eternity I am God. No one can oppose what I do. No one can reverse my actions.\"",
  "14": "The LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says: \"For your sakes I will send an invading army against Babylon. And the Babylonians will be forced to flee in those ships they are so proud of.",
  "15": "I am the LORD, your Holy One, Israel's Creator and King.",
  "16": "I am the LORD, who opened a way through the waters, making a dry path through the sea.",
  "17": "I called forth the mighty army of Egypt with all its chariots and horses. I drew them beneath the waves, and they drowned, their lives snuffed out like a smoldering candlewick.",
  "18": "\"But forget all that--it is nothing compared to what I am going to do.",
  "19": "For I am about to do a brand-new thing. See, I have already begun! Do you not see it? I will make a pathway through the wilderness for my people to come home. I will create rivers for them in the desert!",
  "20": "The wild animals in the fields will thank me, the jackals and ostriches, too, for giving them water in the wilderness. Yes, I will make springs in the desert, so that my chosen people can be refreshed.",
  "21": "I have made Israel for myself, and they will someday honor me before the whole world.",
  "22": "\"But, my dear people, you refuse to ask for my help. You have grown tired of me!",
  "23": "You have not brought me lambs for burnt offerings. You have not honored me with sacrifices, though I have not burdened and wearied you with my requests for grain offerings and incense.",
  "24": "You have not brought me fragrant incense or pleased me with the fat from sacrifices. Instead, you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your faults.",
  "25": "\"I--yes, I alone--am the one who blots out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.",
  "26": "Let us review the situation together, and you can present your case if you have one.",
  "27": "From the very beginning, your ancestors sinned against me--all your leaders broke my laws.",
  "28": "That is why I have disgraced your priests and assigned Israel a future of complete destruction and shame."
