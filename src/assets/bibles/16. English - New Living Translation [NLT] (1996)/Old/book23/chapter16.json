  "2": "The women of Moab are left like homeless birds at the shallow crossings of the Arnon River.",
  "3": "\"Help us,\" they cry. \"Defend us against our enemies. Protect us from their relentless attack. Do not betray us.",
  "4": "Let our outcasts stay among you. Hide them from our enemies until the terror is past.\" When oppression and destruction have ceased and enemy raiders have disappeared,",

  "6": "Is this Moab, the proud land we have heard so much about? Its pride and insolence are all gone now!",
  "7": "The entire land of Moab weeps. Yes, you people of Moab, mourn for the delicacies of Kir-hareseth.",
  "8": "Weep for the abandoned farms of Heshbon and the vineyards at Sibmah. The wine from those vineyards used to make the rulers of the nations drunk. Moab was once like a spreading grapevine. Her tendrils spread out as far as Jazer and trailed out into the desert. Her shoots once reached as far as the Dead Sea.",

  "14": "But now the LORD says, \"Within three years, without fail, the glory of Moab will be ended, and few of its people will be left alive.\""
