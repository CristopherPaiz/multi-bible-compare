  "1": "Look, a righteous king is coming! And honest princes will rule under him.",
  "2": "He will shelter Israel from the storm and the wind. He will refresh her as a river in the desert and as the cool shadow of a large rock in a hot and weary land.",
  "3": "Then everyone who can see will be looking for God, and those who can hear will listen to his voice.",
  "4": "Even the hotheads among them will be full of sense and understanding. Those who stammer in uncertainty will speak out plainly.",
  "5": "In that day ungodly fools will not be heroes. Wealthy cheaters will not be respected as outstanding citizens.",
  "6": "Everyone will recognize ungodly fools for what they are. They spread lies about the LORD; they deprive the hungry of food and give no water to the thirsty.",
  "7": "The smooth tricks of evil people will be exposed, including all the lies they use to oppress the poor in the courts.",
  "8": "But good people will be generous to others and will be blessed for all they do.",
  "9": "Listen, you women who lie around in lazy ease. Listen to me, and I will tell you of your reward.",
  "10": "In a short time--in just a little more than a year--you careless ones will suddenly begin to care. For your fruit crop will fail, and the harvest will never take place.",
  "11": "Tremble, you women of ease; throw off your unconcern. Strip off your pretty clothes, and wear sackcloth in your grief.",
  "12": "Beat your breasts in sorrow for your bountiful farms that will soon be gone, and for those fruitful vines of other years.",
  "13": "For your land will be overgrown with thorns and briers. Your joyful homes and happy cities will be gone.",
  "14": "The palace and the city will be deserted, and busy towns will be empty. Herds of donkeys and goats will graze on the hills where the watchtowers are,",
  "15": "until at last the Spirit is poured down upon us from heaven. Then the wilderness will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will become a lush and fertile forest.",
  "16": "Justice will rule in the wilderness and righteousness in the fertile field.",
  "17": "And this righteousness will bring peace. Quietness and confidence will fill the land forever.",
  "18": "My people will live in safety, quietly at home. They will be at rest.",
  "19": "Even though the forest will be destroyed and the city torn down,",
  "20": "God will greatly bless his people. Wherever they plant seed, bountiful crops will spring up. Their flocks and herds will graze in green pastures."
