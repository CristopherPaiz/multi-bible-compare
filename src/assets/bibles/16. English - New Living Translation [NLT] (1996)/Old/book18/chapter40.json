  "1": "Then the LORD said to Job,",
  "2": "\"Do you still want to argue with the Almighty? You are God's critic, but do you have the answers?\"",
  "3": "Then Job replied to the LORD,",
  "4": "\"I am nothing--how could I ever find the answers? I will put my hand over my mouth in silence.",
  "5": "I have said too much already. I have nothing more to say.\"",
  "6": "Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind:",
  "7": "\"Brace yourself, because I have some questions for you, and you must answer them.",
  "8": "Are you going to discredit my justice and condemn me so you can say you are right?",
  "9": "Are you as strong as God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?",
  "10": "All right then, put on your robes of state, your majesty and splendor.",
  "11": "Give vent to your anger. Let it overflow against the proud.",
  "12": "Humiliate the proud with a glance; walk on the wicked where they stand.",

  "15": "\"Take a look at the mighty hippopotamus. I made it, just as I made you. It eats grass like an ox.",

  "17": "Its tail is as straight as a cedar. The sinews of its thighs are tightly knit together.",
  "18": "Its bones are tubes of bronze. Its limbs are bars of iron.",
  "19": "It is a prime example of God's amazing handiwork. Only its Creator can threaten it.",
  "20": "The mountains offer it their best food, where all the wild animals play.",
  "21": "It lies down under the lotus plants, hidden by the reeds.",
  "22": "The lotus plants give it shade among the willows beside the stream.",
  "23": "It is not disturbed by raging rivers, not even when the swelling Jordan rushes down upon it.",
  "24": "No one can catch it off guard or put a ring in its nose and lead it away."
