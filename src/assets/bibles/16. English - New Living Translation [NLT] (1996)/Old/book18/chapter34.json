  "1": "Then Elihu said:",
  "2": "\"Listen to me, you wise men. Pay attention, you who have knowledge.",
  "3": "`Just as the mouth tastes good food, the ear tests the words it hears.'",
  "4": "So let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.",
  "5": "For Job has said, `I am innocent, but God has taken away my rights.",
  "6": "I am innocent, but they call me a liar. My suffering is incurable, even though I have not sinned.'",
  "7": "\"Has there ever been a man as arrogant as Job, with his thirst for irreverent talk?",
  "8": "He seeks the companionship of evil people. He spends his time with wicked men.",
  "9": "He has even said, `Why waste time trying to please God?'",
  "10": "\"Listen to me, you who have understanding. Everyone knows that God doesn't sin! The Almighty can do no wrong.",
  "11": "He repays people according to their deeds. He treats people according to their ways.",
  "12": "There is no truer statement than this: God will not do wrong. The Almighty cannot twist justice.",
  "13": "Who put the world in his care? Who has set the whole world in place?",
  "14": "If God were to take back his spirit and withdraw his breath,",
  "15": "all life would cease, and humanity would turn again to dust.",
  "16": "\"Listen now and try to understand.",
  "17": "Could God govern if he hated justice? Are you going to condemn the almighty Judge?",
  "18": "For he says to kings and nobles, `You are wicked and unjust.'",
  "19": "He doesn't care how great a person may be, and he doesn't pay any more attention to the rich than to the poor. He made them all.",
  "20": "In a moment they die. At midnight they all pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.",
  "21": "\"For God carefully watches the way people live; he sees everything they do.",
  "22": "No darkness is thick enough to hide the wicked from his eyes.",
  "23": "For it is not up to mortals to decide when to come before God in judgment.",
  "24": "He brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone, and he sets up others in their places.",
  "25": "He watches what they do, and in the night he overturns them, destroying them.",
  "26": "He openly strikes them down for their wickedness.",
  "27": "For they turned aside from following him. They have no respect for any of his ways.",
  "28": "So they cause the poor to cry out, catching God's attention. Yes, he hears the cries of the needy.",
  "29": "When he is quiet, who can make trouble? But when he hides his face, who can find him?",
  "30": "He prevents the godless from ruling so they cannot be a snare to the people.",
  "31": "\"Why don't people say to God, `I have sinned, but I will sin no more'?",
  "32": "Or `I don't know what evil I have done; tell me, and I will stop at once'?",
  "33": "\"Must God tailor his justice to your demands? But you have rejected him! The choice is yours, not mine. Go ahead, share your wisdom with us.",
  "34": "After all, bright people will tell me, and wise people will hear me say,",
  "35": "`Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'",
  "36": "Job, you deserve the maximum penalty for the wicked way you have talked.",
  "37": "For now you have added rebellion and blasphemy against God to your other sins.\""
