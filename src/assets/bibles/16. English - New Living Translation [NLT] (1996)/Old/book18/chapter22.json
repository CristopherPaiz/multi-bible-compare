  "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:",
  "2": "\"Can a person's actions be of benefit to God? Can even a wise person be helpful to him?",
  "3": "Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Would it be any gain to him if you were perfect?",
  "4": "Is it because of your reverence for him that he accuses and judges you?",
  "5": "Not at all! It is because of your wickedness! Your guilt has no limit!",
  "6": "\"For example, you must have lent money to your friend and then kept the clothing he gave you as a pledge. Yes, you stripped him to the bone.",
  "7": "You must have refused water for the thirsty and food for the hungry.",
  "8": "After all, you think the land belongs to the powerful and that those who are privileged have a right to it!",
  "9": "You must have sent widows away without helping them and crushed the strength of orphans.",
  "10": "That is why you are surrounded by traps and sudden fears.",
  "11": "That is why you cannot see in the darkness, and waves of water cover you.",
  "12": "\"God is so great--higher than the heavens, higher than the farthest stars.",
  "13": "But you reply, `That's why God can't see what I am doing! How can he judge through the thick darkness?",
  "14": "For thick clouds swirl about him, and he cannot see us. He is way up there, walking on the vault of heaven.'",
  "15": "\"Will you continue on the old paths where evil people have walked?",
  "16": "They were snatched away in the prime of life, and the foundations of their lives were washed away forever.",
  "17": "For they said to God, `Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do for us?'",
  "18": "But they forgot that he had filled their homes with good things, so I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.",
  "19": "\"Now the righteous will be happy to see the wicked destroyed, and the innocent will laugh them to scorn.",
  "20": "They will say, `Surely our enemies have been destroyed. The last of them have been consumed in the fire.'",
  "21": "\"Stop quarreling with God! If you agree with him, you will have peace at last, and things will go well for you.",
  "22": "Listen to his instructions, and store them in your heart.",
  "23": "If you return to the Almighty and clean up your life, you will be restored.",
  "24": "Give up your lust for money, and throw your precious gold into the river.",
  "25": "Then the Almighty himself will be your treasure. He will be your precious silver!",
  "26": "\"Then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and look up to God.",
  "27": "You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him.",
  "28": "Whatever you decide to do will be accomplished, and light will shine on the road ahead of you.",
  "29": "If someone is brought low and you say, `Help him up,' God will save the downcast.",
  "30": "Then even sinners will be rescued by your pure hands.\""
