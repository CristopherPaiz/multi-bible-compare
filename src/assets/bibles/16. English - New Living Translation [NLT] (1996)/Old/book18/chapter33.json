  "1": "\"Listen, Job, to what I have to say.",
  "2": "Now that I have begun to speak, let me continue.",
  "3": "I speak with all sincerity; I speak the truth.",
  "4": "For the Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.",
  "5": "Answer me, if you can; make your case and take your stand.",
  "6": "\"Look, you and I are the same before God. I, too, was formed from clay.",
  "7": "So you don't need to be afraid of me. I am not some great person to make you nervous and afraid.",
  "8": "\"You have said it in my hearing. I have heard your very words.",
  "9": "You said, `I am pure; I am innocent; I have not sinned.",
  "10": "God is picking a quarrel with me, and he considers me to be his enemy.",
  "11": "He puts my feet in the stocks and watches every move I make.'",
  "12": "\"In this you are not right, and I will show you why. As you yourself have said, `God is greater than any person.'",
  "13": "So why are you bringing a charge against him? You say, `He does not respond to people's complaints.'",
  "14": "But God speaks again and again, though people do not recognize it.",
  "15": "He speaks in dreams, in visions of the night when deep sleep falls on people as they lie in bed.",
  "16": "He whispers in their ear and terrifies them with his warning.",
  "17": "He causes them to change their minds; he keeps them from pride.",
  "18": "He keeps them from the grave, from crossing over the river of death.",
  "19": "Or God disciplines people with sickness and pain, with ceaseless aching in their bones.",
  "20": "They lose their appetite and do not care for even the most delicious food.",
  "21": "They waste away to skin and bones.",
  "22": "They are at death's door; the angels of death wait for them.",
  "23": "\"But if a special messenger from heaven is there to intercede for a person, to declare that he is upright,",
  "24": "God will be gracious and say, `Set him free. Do not make him die, for I have found a ransom for his life.'",
  "25": "Then his body will become as healthy as a child's, firm and youthful again.",
  "26": "When he prays to God, he will be accepted. And God will receive him with joy and restore him to good standing.",
  "27": "He will declare to his friends, `I sinned, but it was not worth it.",
  "28": "God rescued me from the grave, and now my life is filled with light.'",
  "29": "\"Yes, God often does these things for people.",
  "30": "He rescues them from the grave so they may live in the light of the living.",
  "31": "Mark this well, Job. Listen to me, and let me say more.",
  "32": "But if you have anything to say, go ahead. I want to hear it, for I am anxious to see you justified.",
  "33": "But if not, then listen to me. Keep silent and I will teach you wisdom!\""
