  "5": "You are trying to overcome me, using my humiliation as evidence of my sin,",
  "6": "but it is God who has wronged me. I cannot defend myself, for I am like a city under siege.",

  "26": "And after my body has decayed, yet in my body I will see God!",
  "27": "I will see him for myself. Yes, I will see him with my own eyes. I am overwhelmed at the thought!",
  "28": "\"How dare you go on persecuting me, saying, `It's his own fault'?",
  "29": "I warn you, you yourselves are in danger of punishment for your attitude. Then you will know that there is judgment.\""
