  "1": "Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:",
  "2": "\"I must reply because I am greatly disturbed.",
  "3": "I have had to endure your insults, but now my spirit prompts me to reply.",
  "4": "\"Don't you realize that ever since people were first placed on the earth,",
  "5": "the triumph of the wicked has been short-lived and the joy of the godless has been only temporary?",
  "6": "Though the godless man's pride reaches to the heavens and though his head touches the clouds,",
  "7": "yet he will perish forever, thrown away like his own dung. Those who knew him will ask, `Where is he?'",
  "8": "He will fade like a dream and not be found. He will vanish like a vision in the night.",
  "9": "Neither his friends nor his family will ever see him again.",
  "10": "His children will beg from the poor, for he must give back his ill-gotten wealth.",
  "11": "He was just a young man, but his bones will lie in the dust.",
  "12": "\"He enjoyed the taste of his wickedness, letting it melt under his tongue.",

  "15": "He will vomit the wealth he swallowed. God won't let him keep it down.",
  "16": "He will suck the poison of snakes. The viper will kill him.",
  "17": "He will never again enjoy abundant streams of olive oil or rivers of milk and honey.",
  "18": "His labors will not be rewarded. His wealth will bring him no joy.",

  "20": "He was always greedy but never satisfied. Of all the things he dreamed about, nothing remains.",
  "21": "Nothing is left after he finishes gorging himself; therefore, his prosperity will not endure.",
  "22": "\"In the midst of plenty, he will run into trouble, and disasters will destroy him.",
  "23": "May God give him a bellyful of trouble. May God rain down his anger upon him.",
  "24": "He will try to escape, but God's arrow will pierce him.",
  "25": "The arrow is pulled from his body, and the arrowhead glistens with blood. The terrors of death are upon him.",
  "26": "\"His treasures will be lost in deepest darkness. A wildfire will devour his goods, consuming all he has left.",
  "27": "The heavens will reveal his guilt, and the earth will give testimony against him.",
  "28": "A flood will sweep away his house. God's anger will descend on him in torrents.",
  "29": "This is the fate that awaits the wicked. It is the inheritance decreed by God.\""
