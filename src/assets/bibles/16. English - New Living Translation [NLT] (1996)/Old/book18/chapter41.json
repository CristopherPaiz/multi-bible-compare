  "1": "\"Can you catch a crocodile with a hook or put a noose around its jaw?",
  "2": "Can you tie it with a rope through the nose or pierce its jaw with a spike?",
  "3": "Will it beg you for mercy or implore you for pity?",
  "4": "Will it agree to work for you? Can you make it be your slave for life?",
  "5": "Can you make it a pet like a bird, or give it to your little girls to play with?",
  "6": "Will merchants try to buy it? Will they sell it in their shops?",
  "7": "Will its hide be hurt by darts, or its head by a harpoon?",
  "8": "If you lay a hand on it, you will never forget the battle that follows, and you will never try it again!",
  "9": "\"No, it is useless to try to capture it. The hunter who attempts it will be thrown down.",
  "10": "And since no one dares to disturb the crocodile, who would dare to stand up to me?",
  "11": "Who will confront me and remain safe? Everything under heaven is mine.",
  "12": "\"I want to emphasize the tremendous strength in the crocodile's limbs and throughout its enormous frame.",
  "13": "Who can strip off its hide, and who can penetrate its double layer of armor?",
  "14": "Who could pry open its jaws? For its teeth are terrible!",
  "15": "The overlapping scales on its back make a shield.",
  "16": "They are close together so no air can get between them.",
  "17": "They lock together so nothing can penetrate them.",
  "18": "\"When it sneezes, it flashes light! Its eyes are like the red of dawn.",
  "19": "Fire and sparks leap from its mouth.",
  "20": "Smoke streams from its nostrils like steam from a boiling pot on a fire of dry rushes.",
  "21": "Yes, its breath would kindle coals, for flames shoot from its mouth.",
  "22": "\"The tremendous strength in its neck strikes terror wherever it goes.",
  "23": "Its flesh is hard and firm, not soft and fat.",
  "24": "Its heart is as hard as rock, as hard as a millstone.",
  "25": "When it rises, the mighty are afraid, gripped by terror.",
  "26": "No sword can stop it, nor spear nor dart nor pointed shaft.",
  "27": "To the crocodile, iron is nothing but straw, and bronze is rotten wood.",
  "28": "Arrows cannot make it flee. Stones shot from a sling are as ineffective as straw.",
  "29": "Clubs do no good, and it laughs at the swish of the javelins.",
  "30": "Its belly is covered with scales as sharp as glass. They tear up the ground as it drags through the mud.",
  "31": "\"The crocodile makes the water boil with its commotion. It churns the depths.",
  "32": "The water glistens in its wake. One would think the sea had turned white.",
  "33": "There is nothing else so fearless anywhere on earth.",
  "34": "Of all the creatures, it is the proudest. It is the king of beasts.\""
