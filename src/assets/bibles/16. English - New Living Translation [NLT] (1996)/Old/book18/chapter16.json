  "1": "Then Job spoke again:",
  "2": "\"I have heard all this before. What miserable comforters you are!",
  "3": "Won't you ever stop your flow of foolish words? What have I said that makes you speak so endlessly?",
  "4": "I could say the same things if you were in my place. I could spout off my criticisms against you and shake my head at you.",
  "5": "But that's not what I would do. I would speak in a way that helps you. I would try to take away your grief.",
  "6": "But as it is, my grief remains no matter how I defend myself. And it does not help if I refuse to speak.",
  "7": "\"O God, you have ground me down and devastated my family.",
  "8": "You have reduced me to skin and bones--as proof, they say, of my sins.",
  "9": "God hates me and tears angrily at my flesh. He gnashes his teeth at me and pierces me with his eyes.",
  "10": "People jeer and laugh at me. They slap my cheek in contempt. A mob gathers against me.",
  "11": "God has handed me over to sinners. He has tossed me into the hands of the wicked.",
  "12": "\"I was living quietly until he broke me apart. He took me by the neck and dashed me to pieces. Then he set me up as his target.",
  "13": "His archers surrounded me, and his arrows pierced me without mercy. The ground is wet with my blood.",
  "14": "Again and again he smashed me, charging at me like a warrior.",
  "15": "Here I sit in sackcloth. I have surrendered, and I sit in the dust.",
  "16": "My eyes are red with weeping; darkness covers my eyes.",
  "17": "Yet I am innocent, and my prayer is pure.",
  "18": "\"O earth, do not conceal my blood. Let it cry out on my behalf.",
  "19": "Even now my witness is in heaven. My advocate is there on high.",
  "20": "My friends scorn me, but I pour out my tears to God.",
  "21": "Oh, that someone would mediate between God and me, as a person mediates between friends.",
  "22": "For soon I must go down that road from which I will never return."
