  "1": "\"But now I am mocked by those who are younger than I, by young men whose fathers are not worthy to run with my sheepdogs.",
  "2": "A lot of good they are to me--those worn-out wretches!",
  "3": "They are gaunt with hunger and flee to the deserts and the wastelands, desolate and gloomy.",
  "4": "They eat coarse leaves, and they burn the roots of shrubs for heat.",
  "5": "They are driven from civilization, and people shout after them as if they were thieves.",
  "6": "So now they live in frightening ravines and in caves and among the rocks.",
  "7": "They sound like animals as they howl among the bushes; they huddle together for shelter beneath the nettles.",
  "8": "They are nameless fools, outcasts of civilization.",
  "9": "\"And now their sons mock me with their vulgar song! They taunt me!",
  "10": "They despise me and won't come near me, except to spit in my face.",
  "11": "For God has cut the cords of my tent. He has humbled me, so they have thrown off all restraint.",
  "12": "These outcasts oppose me to my face. They send me sprawling; they lay traps in my path.",
  "13": "They block my road and do everything they can to hasten my calamity, knowing full well that I have no one to help me.",
  "14": "They come at me from all directions. They rush upon me when I am down.",
  "15": "I live in terror now. They hold me in contempt, and my prosperity has vanished as a cloud before a strong wind.",
  "16": "\"And now my heart is broken. Depression haunts my days.",
  "17": "My weary nights are filled with pain as though something were relentlessly gnawing at my bones.",
  "18": "With a strong hand, God grabs my garment. He grips me by the collar of my tunic.",
  "19": "He has thrown me into the mud. I have become as dust and ashes.",
  "20": "\"I cry to you, O God, but you don't answer me. I stand before you, and you don't bother to look.",
  "21": "You have become cruel toward me. You persecute me with your great power.",
  "22": "You throw me into the whirlwind and destroy me in the storm.",
  "23": "And I know that you are sending me to my death--the destination of all who live.",
  "24": "\"Surely no one would turn against the needy when they cry for help.",
  "25": "Did I not weep for those in trouble? Was I not deeply grieved for the needy?",
  "26": "So I looked for good, but evil came instead. I waited for the light, but darkness fell.",
  "27": "My heart is troubled and restless. Days of affliction have come upon me.",
  "28": "I walk in gloom, without sunlight. I stand in the public square and cry for help.",
  "29": "But instead, I am considered a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches.",
  "30": "My skin has turned dark, and my bones burn with fever.",
  "31": "My harp plays sad music, and my flute accompanies those who weep."
