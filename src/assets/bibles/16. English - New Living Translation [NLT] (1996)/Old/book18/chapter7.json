  "1": "\"Is this not the struggle of all humanity? A person's life is long and hard, like that of a hired hand,",
  "2": "like a worker who longs for the day to end, like a servant waiting to be paid.",
  "3": "I, too, have been assigned months of futility, long and weary nights of misery.",
  "4": "When I go to bed, I think, `When will it be morning?' But the night drags on, and I toss till dawn.",
  "5": "My skin is filled with worms and scabs. My flesh breaks open, full of pus.",
  "6": "\"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle flying back and forth. They end without hope.",
  "7": "O God, remember that my life is but a breath, and I will never again experience pleasure.",
  "8": "You see me now, but not for long. Your eyes will be on me, but I will be dead.",
  "9": "Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes, those who die will not come back.",
  "10": "They are gone forever from their home--never to be seen again.",
  "11": "\"I cannot keep from speaking. I must express my anguish. I must complain in my bitterness.",
  "12": "Am I a sea monster that you place a guard on me?",
  "13": "If I think, `My bed will comfort me, and I will try to forget my misery with sleep,'",
  "14": "you shatter me with dreams. You terrify me with visions.",

  "16": "I hate my life. I do not want to go on living. Oh, leave me alone for these few remaining days.",

  "18": "For you examine us every morning and test us every moment.",
  "19": "Why won't you leave me alone--even for a moment?",
  "20": "Have I sinned? What have I done to you, O watcher of all humanity? Why have you made me your target? Am I a burden to you?",
  "21": "Why not just pardon my sin and take away my guilt? For soon I will lie down in the dust and die. When you look for me, I will be gone.\""
