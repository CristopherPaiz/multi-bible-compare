  "1": "At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth.",
  "2": "He said:",
  "3": "\"Cursed be the day of my birth, and cursed be the night when I was conceived.",
  "4": "Let that day be turned to darkness. Let it be lost even to God on high, and let it be shrouded in darkness.",
  "5": "Yes, let the darkness and utter gloom claim it for its own. Let a black cloud overshadow it, and let the darkness terrify it.",
  "6": "Let that night be blotted off the calendar, never again to be counted among the days of the year, never again to appear among the months.",
  "7": "Let that night be barren. Let it have no joy.",
  "8": "Let those who are experts at cursing--those who are ready to rouse the sea monster--curse that day.",
  "9": "Let its morning stars remain dark. Let it hope for light, but in vain; may it never see the morning light.",
  "10": "Curse it for its failure to shut my mother's womb, for letting me be born to all this trouble.",
  "11": "\"Why didn't I die at birth as I came from the womb?",
  "12": "Why did my mother let me live? Why did she nurse me at her breasts?",
  "13": "For if I had died at birth, I would be at peace now, asleep and at rest.",
  "14": "I would rest with the world's kings and prime ministers, famous for their great construction projects.",
  "15": "I would rest with wealthy princes whose palaces were filled with gold and silver.",
  "16": "Why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like a baby who never lives to see the light?",
  "17": "For in death the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "Even prisoners are at ease in death, with no guards to curse them.",
  "19": "Rich and poor are there alike, and the slave is free from his master.",
  "20": "\"Oh, why should light be given to the weary, and life to those in misery?",
  "21": "They long for death, and it won't come. They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure.",
  "22": "It is a blessed relief when they finally die, when they find the grave.",
  "23": "Why is life given to those with no future, those destined by God to live in distress?",
  "24": "I cannot eat for sighing; my groans pour out like water.",
  "25": "What I always feared has happened to me. What I dreaded has come to be.",
  "26": "I have no peace, no quietness. I have no rest; instead, only trouble comes.\""
