  "1": "Then Job spoke again:",
  "2": "\"Yes, I know this is all true in principle. But how can a person be declared innocent in the eyes of God?",
  "3": "If someone wanted to take God to court, would it be possible to answer him even once in a thousand times?",
  "4": "For God is so wise and so mighty. Who has ever challenged him successfully?",
  "5": "\"Without warning, he moves the mountains, overturning them in his anger.",
  "6": "He shakes the earth from its place, and its foundations tremble.",
  "7": "If he commands it, the sun won't rise and the stars won't shine.",
  "8": "He alone has spread out the heavens and marches on the waves of the sea.",
  "9": "He made all the stars--the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky.",
  "10": "His great works are too marvelous to understand. He performs miracles without number.",
  "11": "\"Yet when he comes near, I cannot see him. When he moves on, I do not see him go.",
  "12": "If he sends death to snatch someone away, who can stop him? Who dares to ask him, `What are you doing?'",
  "13": "And God does not restrain his anger. The mightiest forces against him are crushed beneath his feet.",
  "14": "\"And who am I, that I should try to answer God or even reason with him?",
  "15": "Even if I were innocent, I would have no defense. I could only plead for mercy.",
  "16": "And even if I summoned him and he responded, he would never listen to me.",
  "17": "For he attacks me without reason, and he multiplies my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "He will not let me catch my breath, but fills me instead with bitter sorrows.",
  "19": "As for strength, he has it. As for justice, who can challenge him?",
  "20": "Though I am innocent, my own mouth would pronounce me guilty. Though I am blameless, it would prove me wicked.",
  "21": "\"I am innocent, but it makes no difference to me--I despise my life.",
  "22": "Innocent or wicked, it is all the same to him. That is why I say, `He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'",
  "23": "He laughs when a plague suddenly kills the innocent.",
  "24": "The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked, and God blinds the eyes of the judges and lets them be unfair. If not he, then who?",
  "25": "\"My life passes more swiftly than a runner. It flees away, filled with tragedy.",
  "26": "It disappears like a swift boat, like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.",
  "27": "If I decided to forget my complaints, if I decided to end my sadness and be cheerful,",
  "28": "I would dread all the pain he would send. For I know you will not hold me innocent, O God.",
  "29": "Whatever happens, I will be found guilty. So what's the use of trying?",
  "30": "Even if I were to wash myself with soap and cleanse my hands with lye to make them absolutely clean,",
  "31": "you would plunge me into a muddy ditch, and I would be so filthy my own clothing would hate me.",
  "32": "\"God is not a mortal like me, so I cannot argue with him or take him to trial.",
  "33": "If only there were a mediator who could bring us together, but there is none.",
  "34": "The mediator could make God stop beating me, and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment.",
  "35": "Then I could speak to him without fear, but I cannot do that in my own strength."
