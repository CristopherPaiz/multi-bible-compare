  "1": "Then Job spoke again:",
  "2": "\"If my sadness could be weighed and my troubles be put on the scales,",
  "3": "they would be heavier than all the sands of the sea. That is why I spoke so rashly.",
  "4": "For the Almighty has struck me down with his arrows. He has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit. All God's terrors are arrayed against me.",
  "5": "Don't I have a right to complain? Wild donkeys bray when they find no green grass, and oxen low when they have no food.",
  "6": "People complain when there is no salt in their food. And how tasteless is the uncooked white of an egg!",
  "7": "My appetite disappears when I look at it; I gag at the thought of eating it!",
  "8": "\"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant my hope.",
  "9": "I wish he would crush me. I wish he would reach out his hand and kill me.",
  "10": "At least I can take comfort in this: Despite the pain, I have not denied the words of the Holy One.",
  "11": "But I do not have the strength to endure. I do not have a goal that encourages me to carry on.",
  "12": "Do I have strength as hard as stone? Is my body made of bronze?",
  "13": "No, I am utterly helpless, without any chance of success.",
  "14": "\"One should be kind to a fainting friend, but you have accused me without the slightest fear of the Almighty.",
  "15": "My brother, you have proved as unreliable as a seasonal brook that overflows its banks in the spring",
  "16": "when it is swollen with ice and melting snow.",
  "17": "But when the hot weather arrives, the water disappears. The brook vanishes in the heat.",
  "18": "The caravans turn aside to be refreshed, but there is nothing there to drink, and so they perish in the desert.",
  "19": "With high hopes, the caravans from Tema and from Sheba stop for water,",
  "20": "but finding none, their hopes are dashed.",
  "21": "You, too, have proved to be of no help. You have seen my calamity, and you are afraid.",
  "22": "But why? Have I ever asked you for a gift? Have I begged you to use any of your wealth on my behalf?",
  "23": "Have I ever asked you to rescue me from my enemies? Have I asked you to save me from ruthless people?",
  "24": "\"All I want is a reasonable answer--then I will keep quiet. Tell me, what have I done wrong?",
  "25": "Honest words are painful, but what do your criticisms amount to?",
  "26": "Do you think your words are convincing when you disregard my cry of desperation?",
  "27": "You would even send an orphan into slavery or sell a friend.",
  "28": "Look at me! Would I lie to your face?",
  "29": "Stop assuming my guilt, for I am righteous. Don't be so unjust.",
  "30": "Do you think I am lying? Don't I know the difference between right and wrong?"
