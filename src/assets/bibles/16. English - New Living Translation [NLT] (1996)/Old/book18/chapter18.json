  "2": "\"How long before you stop talking? Speak sense if you want us to answer!",
  "3": "Do you think we are cattle? Do you think we have no intelligence?",
  "4": "You may tear your hair out in anger, but will that cause the earth to be abandoned? Will it make rocks fall from a cliff?",
  "5": "\"The truth remains that the light of the wicked will be snuffed out. The sparks of their fire will not glow.",
  "6": "The light in their tent will grow dark. The lamp hanging above them will be quenched.",
  "7": "The confident stride of the wicked will be shortened. Their own schemes will be their downfall.",
  "8": "\"The wicked walk into a net. They fall into a pit that's been dug in the path.",
  "9": "A trap grabs them by the heel. A noose tightens around them.",
  "10": "A snare lies hidden in the ground. A rope lies coiled on their path.",
  "11": "\"Terrors surround the wicked and trouble them at every step.",
  "12": "Their vigor is depleted by hunger, and calamity waits for them to stumble.",
  "13": "Disease eats their skin; death devours their limbs.",
  "14": "They are torn from the security of their tent, and they are brought down to the king of terrors.",
  "15": "The home of the wicked will disappear beneath a fiery barrage of burning sulfur.",
  "16": "Their roots will dry up, and their branches will wither.",
  "17": "All memory of their existence will perish from the earth. No one will remember them.",
  "18": "They will be thrust from light into darkness, driven from the world.",
  "19": "They will have neither children nor grandchildren, nor any survivor in their home country.",
  "20": "People in the west are appalled at their fate; people in the east are horrified.",
  "21": "They will say, `This was the home of a wicked person, the place of one who rejected God.'\""
