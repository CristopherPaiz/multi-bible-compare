  "7": "After the LORD had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite: \"I am angry with you and with your two friends, for you have not been right in what you said about me, as my servant Job was.",

  "14": "He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.",
