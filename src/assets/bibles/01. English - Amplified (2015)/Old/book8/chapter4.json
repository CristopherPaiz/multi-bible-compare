  "1": "THEN BOAZ went up to the city's gate and sat down there, and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came by. He said to him, Ho! Turn aside and sit down here. So he turned aside and sat down.",
  "2": "And Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.",
  "3": "And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, has sold the parcel of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.",
  "4": "And I thought to let you hear of it, saying, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then say so, that I may know; for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I am [next of kin] after you. And he said, I will redeem it.",
  "5": "Then Boaz said, The day you buy the field of Naomi, you must buy also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the dead man, to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance.",
  "6": "And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest [by marrying a Moabitess] I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it. [Deut. 23:3, 4.]",
  "7": "Now formerly in Israel this was the custom concerning redeeming and exchanging. To confirm a transaction, a man pulled off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the way of attesting in Israel.",
  "8": "Therefore, when the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself, he pulled off his sandal.",
  "9": "And Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi.",
  "10": "Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his birthplace. You are witnesses this day.",
  "11": "And all the people at the gate and the elders said, We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the household of Israel. May you do worthily and get wealth (power) in Ephratah and be famous in Bethlehem.",
  "12": "And let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman.",
  "13": "So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the Lord caused her to conceive, and she bore a son.",
  "14": "And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, Who has not left you this day without a close kinsman, and may his name be famous in Israel.",
  "15": "And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher and supporter in your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.",
  "16": "Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom and became his nurse.",
  "17": "And her neighbor women gave him a name, saying, A son is born to Naomi. They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ].",
  "18": "Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,",
  "19": "Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab,",
  "20": "Amminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,",
  "21": "Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed,",
  "22": "Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ]."
