  "1": "THERE WAS a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.",
  "2": "And he said to his mother, The 1,100 shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed and also spoke about in my hearing, behold, I have the silver with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you by the Lord, my son!",
  "3": "He restored the 1,100 shekels of silver to his mother, and she said, I had truly dedicated the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will restore it to you.",
  "4": "So when he restored the money to his mother, she took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, who made of it a graven image and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.",
  "5": "And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod and teraphim and dedicated one of his sons, who became his priest.",
  "6": "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.",
  "7": "And there was a young man in Bethlehem of Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.",
  "8": "And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place, and as he journeyed he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.",
  "9": "And Micah said to him, From where do you come? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.",
  "10": "And Micah said to him, Dwell with me and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver each year, a suit of clothes, and your living. So the Levite went in.",
  "11": "And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man was to Micah as one of his sons.",
  "12": "And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah.",
  "13": "Then said Micah, Now I know that the Lord will favor me, since I have a Levite to be my priest."
