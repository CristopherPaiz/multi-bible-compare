  "1": "BUT THE Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.",
  "2": "And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the Israelites made themselves the dens which are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.",
  "3": "For whenever Israel had sown their seed, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came up against them.",
  "4": "They would encamp against them and destroy the crops as far as Gaza and leave no nourishment for Israel, and no ox or sheep or donkey.",
  "5": "For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came like locusts for multitude; both they and their camels could not be counted. So they wasted the land as they entered it.",
  "6": "And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the Israelites cried to the Lord.",
  "7": "And when they cried to the Lord because of Midian,",
  "8": "The Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites, who said to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage.",
  "9": "And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you and gave you their land.",
  "10": "And I said to you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice.",
  "11": "Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak (terebinth) at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, and his son Gideon was beating wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.",
  "12": "And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of [fearless] courage.",
  "13": "And Gideon said to him, O sir, if the Lord is with us, why is all this befallen us? And where are all His wondrous works of which our fathers told us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.",
  "14": "The Lord turned to him and said, Go in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?",
  "15": "Gideon said to Him, Oh Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my clan is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.",
  "16": "The Lord said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midianites as one man.",
  "17": "Gideon said to Him, If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You Who talks with me.",
  "18": "Do not leave here, I pray You, until I return to You and bring my offering and set it before You. And He said, I will wait until you return.",
  "19": "Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them to Him under the oak and presented them.",
  "20": "And the Angel of God said to him, Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock and pour the broth over them. And he did so.",
  "21": "Then the Angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes, and there flared up fire from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.",
  "22": "And when Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! For now I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!",
  "23": "The Lord said to him, Peace be to you, do not fear; you shall not die.",
  "24": "Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, The Lord is Peace. To this day it still stands in Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.",
  "25": "That night the Lord said to Gideon, Take your father's bull, the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has and cut down the Asherah [symbol of the goddess Asherah] that is beside it;",
  "26": "And build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this stronghold with stones laid in proper order. Then take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.",
  "27": "Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him, but because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it by night.",
  "28": "And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the Asherah was cut down that was beside it, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built.",
  "29": "And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And when they searched and asked, they were told, Gideon son of Joash has done this thing.",
  "30": "Then the men of the city commanded Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.",
  "31": "But Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for Baal, let him be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself because one has pulled down his altar.",
  "32": "Therefore on that day he called Gideon Jerubbaal, meaning, Let Baal contend against him, because he had pulled down his altar.",
  "33": "Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came together and, crossing the Jordan, encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.",
  "34": "But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon with Himself and took possession of him, and he blew a trumpet, and [the clan of] Abiezer was gathered to him.",
  "35": "And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and the Manassites were called to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, to Zebulun, and to Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.",
  "36": "And Gideon said to God, If You will deliver Israel by my hand as You have said,",
  "37": "Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have said.",
  "38": "And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the dew out of the fleece, he wrung from it a bowlful of water.",
  "39": "And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Let me make trial only this once with the fleece, I pray you; let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew.",
  "40": "And God did so that night, for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
