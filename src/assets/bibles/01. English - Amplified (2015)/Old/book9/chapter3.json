  "6": "And the Lord called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here am I; you did call me. Eli answered, I did not call, my son; lie down again.",
  "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord was not yet revealed to him.",

  "10": "And the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, Samuel! Samuel! Then Samuel answered, Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.",
  "11": "The Lord told Samuel, Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of all who hear it shall tingle.",
  "12": "On that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.",
  "13": "And I [now] announce to him that I will judge and punish his house forever for the iniquity of which he knew, for his sons were bringing a curse upon themselves [blaspheming God], and he did not restrain them.",
  "14": "Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for or purged with sacrifice or offering forever.",

  "19": "Samuel grew; the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. [Josh. 23:14.]",
  "20": "And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.",
