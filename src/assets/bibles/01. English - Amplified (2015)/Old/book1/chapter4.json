  "1": "AND ADAM knew Eve as his wife, and she became pregnant and bore Cain; and she said, I have gotten and gained a man with the help of the Lord.",
  "2": "And [next] she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.",
  "3": "And in the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground.",
  "4": "And Abel brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat portions. And the Lord had respect and regard for Abel and for his offering, [Heb. 11:4.]",
  "5": "But for Cain and his offering He had no respect or regard. So Cain was exceedingly angry and indignant, and he looked sad and depressed.",
  "6": "And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why do you look sad and depressed and dejected?",
  "7": "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.",
  "8": "And Cain said to his brother, Let us go out to the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. [I John 3:12.]",
  "9": "And the Lord said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "10": "And [the Lord] said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.",
  "11": "And now you are cursed by reason of the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's [shed] blood from your hand.",
  "12": "When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth [in perpetual exile, a degraded outcast].",
  "13": "Then Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.",
  "14": "Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the land, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.",
  "15": "And the Lord said to him, Therefore, if anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark or sign upon Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.",
  "16": "So Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod [wandering], east of Eden.",
  "17": "And Cain's wife [one of Adam's offspring] became pregnant and bore Enoch; and Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.",
  "18": "To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methusael, and Methusael the father of Lamech.",
  "19": "And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah and of the other was Zillah.",
  "20": "Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle and purchase possessions.",
  "21": "His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.",
  "22": "Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all [cutting] instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.",
  "23": "Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say; for I have slain a man [merely] for wounding me, and a young man [only] for striking and bruising me.",
  "24": "If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech [will be avenged] seventy-sevenfold.",
  "25": "And Adam's wife again became pregnant, and she bore a son and called his name Seth. For God, she said, has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.",
  "26": "And to Seth also a son was born, whom he named Enosh. At that time men began to call [upon God] by the name of the Lord."
