  "1": "AND JOSEPH was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain and chief executioner of the [royal] guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.",
  "2": "But the Lord was with Joseph, and he [though a slave] was a successful and prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.",
  "3": "And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to flourish and succeed in his hand. [Gen. 21:22; 26:27, 28; 41:38, 39.]",
  "4": "So Joseph pleased [Potiphar] and found favor in his sight, and he served him. And [his master] made him supervisor over his house and he put all that he had in his charge.",
  "5": "From the time that he made him supervisor in his house and over all that he had, the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the Lord's blessing was on all that he had in the house and in the field.",
  "6": "And [Potiphar] left all that he had in Joseph's charge and paid no attention to anything he had except the food he ate. Now Joseph was an attractive person and fine-looking.",
  "7": "Then after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.",
  "8": "But he refused and said to his master's wife, See here, with me in the house my master has concern about nothing; he has put all that he has in my care.",
  "9": "He is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept anything from me except you, for you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil and sin against God?",
  "10": "She spoke to Joseph day after day, but he did not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.",
  "11": "Then it happened about this time that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the men of the house were indoors.",
  "12": "And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out [of the house].",
  "13": "And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled away,",
  "14": "She called to the men of her household and said to them, Behold, he [your master] has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock and insult us; he came in where I was to lie with me, and I screamed at the top of my voice.",
  "15": "And when he heard me screaming and crying, he left his garment with me and fled and got out of the house.",
  "16": "And she laid up his garment by her until his master came home.",
  "17": "Then she told him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought among us came to me to mock and insult me.",
  "18": "And when I screamed and cried, he left his garment with me and fled out [of the house].",
  "19": "And when [Joseph's] master heard the words of his wife, saying to him, This is the way your servant treated me, his wrath was kindled.",
  "20": "And Joseph's master took him and put him in the prison, a place where the state prisoners were confined; so he was there in the prison.",
  "21": "But the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy and loving-kindness and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison.",
  "22": "And the warden of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatsoever was done there, he was in charge of it.",
  "23": "The prison warden paid no attention to anything that was in [Joseph's] charge, for the Lord was with him and made whatever he did to prosper."
