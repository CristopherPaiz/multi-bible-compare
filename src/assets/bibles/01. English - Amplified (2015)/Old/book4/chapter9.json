  "1": "THE LORD said to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt,",
  "2": "Let the Israelites keep the Passover at its appointed time.",
  "3": "On the fourteenth day of this month in the evening, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and ordinances you shall keep it.",
  "4": "So Moses told the Israelites they should keep the Passover.",
  "5": "And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month in the evening in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the Israelites did.",
  "6": "And there were certain men who were defiled by touching the dead body of a man, so they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.",
  "7": "Those men said to [Moses], We are defiled by touching the dead body. Why are we prevented from offering the Lord's offering at its appointed time among the Israelites?",
  "8": "And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.",
  "9": "And the Lord said to Moses,",
  "10": "Say to the Israelites, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of touching a dead body or is far off on a journey, still he shall keep the Passover to the Lord.",
  "11": "On the fourteenth day of the second month in the evening they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.",
  "12": "They shall leave none of it until the morning nor break any bone of it; according to all the statutes for the Passover they shall keep it. [John 19:36.]",
  "13": "But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet does not keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from among his people because he did not bring the Lord's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear [the penalty of] his sin.",
  "14": "And if a stranger sojourns among you and will keep the Passover to the Lord, according to [its] statutes and its ordinances, so shall he do; you shall have one statute both for the temporary resident and for him who was born in the land.",
  "15": "And on the day that the tabernacle was erected, the cloud [of God's presence] covered the tabernacle, that is, the Tent of the Testimony; and at evening it was over the tabernacle, having the appearance of [a pillar of] fire until the morning. [Exod. 13:21.]",
  "16": "So it was constantly; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.",
  "17": "Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, after that the Israelites journeyed; and in the place where the cloud rested, there the Israelites encamped.",
  "18": "At the Lord's command the Israelites journeyed, and at [His] command they encamped. As long as the cloud rested upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.",
  "19": "Even when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, the Israelites kept the Lord's charge and did not set out.",
  "20": "And sometimes the cloud was only a few days upon the tabernacle, but according to the command of the Lord they remained encamped, and at His command they journeyed.",
  "21": "And sometimes the cloud remained [over the tabernacle] from evening only until morning, but when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed; whether it was taken up by day or by night, they journeyed.",
  "22": "Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, dwelling on it, the Israelites remained encamped; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.",
  "23": "At the command of the Lord they remained encamped, and at [His] command they journeyed; they kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of the Lord through Moses."
