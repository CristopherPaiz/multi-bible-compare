  "27": "And if any person sins unknowingly or unintentionally, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.",
  "28": "And the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the person who commits an error when he sins unknowingly or unintentionally, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.",
  "29": "You shall have one law for him who sins unknowingly or unintentionally, whether he is native born among the Israelites or a stranger who is sojourning among them.",
  "30": "But the person who does anything [wrong] willfully and openly, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one reproaches, reviles, and blasphemes the Lord, and that person shall be cut off from among his people [that the atonement made for them may not include him].",

  "38": "Speak to the Israelites and bid them make fringes or tassels on the corners in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and put upon the fringe of the borders or upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue.",
  "39": "And it shall be to you a fringe or tassel that you may look upon and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them, that you may not spy out and follow after [the desires of] your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to follow and play the harlot [spiritually, if not physically],",
  "40": "That you may remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God.",
  "41": "I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God."
