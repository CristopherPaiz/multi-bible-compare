  "1": "AND MOSES said to the heads or leaders of the tribes of Israel, This is the thing which the Lord has commanded:",
  "2": "If a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break and profane his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.",
  "3": "Also when a woman vows a vow to the Lord and binds herself by a pledge, being in her father's house in her youth,",
  "4": "And her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound herself and he offers no objection, then all her vows shall stand and every pledge with which she has bound herself shall stand.",
  "5": "But if her father refuses to allow her [to carry out her vow] on the day that he hears about it, not any of her vows or of her pledges with which she has bound herself shall stand. And the Lord will forgive her because her father refused to let her [carry out her purpose].",
  "6": "And if she is married to a husband while her vows are upon her or she has bound herself by a rash utterance",
  "7": "And her husband hears of it and holds his peace concerning it on the day that he hears it, then her vows shall stand and her pledge with which she bound herself shall stand.",
  "8": "But if her husband refuses to allow her [to keep her vow or pledge] on the day that he hears of it, then he shall make void and annul her vow which is upon her and the rash utterance of her lips by which she bound herself, and the Lord will forgive her.",
  "9": "But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, with which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.",
  "10": "And if she vowed in her husband's house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath",
  "11": "And her husband heard it and did not oppose or prohibit her, then all her vows and every pledge with which she bound herself shall stand.",
  "12": "But if her husband positively made them void on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning her pledge of herself shall not stand. Her husband has annulled them, and the Lord will forgive her.",
  "13": "Every vow and every binding oath to humble or afflict herself, her husband may establish it or her husband may annul it.",
  "14": "But if her husband altogether holds his peace [concerning the matter] with her from day to day, then he establishes and confirms all her vows or all her pledges which are upon her. He establishes them because he said nothing to [restrain] her on the day he heard of them.",
  "15": "But if he shall nullify them after he hears of them, then he shall be responsible for and bear her iniquity.",
  "16": "These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while in her youth in her father's house."
