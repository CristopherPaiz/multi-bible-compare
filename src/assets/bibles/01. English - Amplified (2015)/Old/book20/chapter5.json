{
  "1": "MY SON, be attentive to my Wisdom [godly Wisdom learned by actual and costly experience], and incline your ear to my understanding [of what is becoming and prudent for you],",
  "2": "That you may exercise proper discrimination and discretion and your lips may guard and keep knowledge and the wise answer [to temptation].",
  "3": "For the lips of a loose woman drip honey as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil; [Ezek. 20:30; Col. 2:8-10; II Pet. 2:14-17.]",
  "4": "But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged and devouring sword.",
  "5": "Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold of Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead).",
  "6": "She loses sight of and walks not in the path of life; her ways wind about aimlessly, and you cannot know them.",
  "7": "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.",
  "8": "Let your way in life be far from her, and come not near the door of her house [avoid the very scenes of temptation], [Prov. 4:15; Rom. 16:17; I Thess. 5:19-22.]",
  "9": "Lest you give your honor to others and your years to those without mercy,",
  "10": "Lest strangers [and false teachings] take their fill of your strength and wealth and your labors go to the house of an alien [from God]--",
  "11": "And you groan and mourn when your end comes, when your flesh and body are consumed,",
  "12": "And you say, How I hated instruction and discipline, and my heart despised reproof!",
  "13": "I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor submitted and consented to those who instructed me.",
  "14": "[The extent and boldness of] my sin involved almost all evil [in the estimation] of the congregation and the community.",
  "15": "Drink waters out of your own cistern [of a pure marriage relationship], and fresh running waters out of your own well.",
  "16": "Should your offspring be dispersed abroad as water brooks in the streets?",
  "17": "[Confine yourself to your own wife] let your children be for you alone, and not the children of strangers with you.",
  "18": "Let your fountain [of human life] be blessed [with the rewards of fidelity], and rejoice in the wife of your youth.",
  "19": "Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant doe [tender, gentle, attractive]--let her bosom satisfy you at all times, and always be transported with delight in her love.",
  "20": "Why should you, my son, be infatuated with a loose woman, embrace the bosom of an outsider, and go astray?",
  "21": "For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the Lord, and He [Who would have us live soberly, chastely, and godly] carefully weighs all man's goings. [II Chron. 16:9; Job 31:4; 34:21; Prov. 15:3; Jer. 16:17; Hos. 7:2; Heb. 4:13.]",
  "22": "His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked man, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.",
  "23": "He will die for lack of discipline and instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray and be lost."
