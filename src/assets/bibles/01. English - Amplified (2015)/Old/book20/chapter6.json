  "1": "MY SON, if you have become security for your neighbor, if you have given your pledge for a stranger or another,",
  "2": "You are snared with the words of your lips, you are caught by the speech of your mouth.",
  "3": "Do this now [at once and earnestly], my son, and deliver yourself when you have put yourself into the power of your neighbor; go, bestir and humble yourself, and beg your neighbor [to pay his debt and thereby release you].",
  "4": "Give not [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids;",
  "5": "Deliver yourself, as a roe or gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.",
  "6": "Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways and be wise!--[Job 12:7.]",
  "7": "Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler,",
  "8": "Provides her food in the summer and gathers her supplies in the harvest.",
  "9": "How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep? [Prov. 24:33, 34.]",
  "10": "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down and sleep--",
  "11": "So will your poverty come like a robber or one who travels [with slowly but surely approaching steps] and your want like an armed man [making you helpless]. [Prov. 10:4; 13:4; 20:4.]",
  "12": "A worthless person, a wicked man, is he who goes about with a perverse (contrary, wayward) mouth.",
  "13": "He winks with his eyes, he speaks by shuffling or tapping with his feet, he makes signs [to mislead and deceive] and teaches with his fingers.",
  "14": "Willful and contrary in his heart, he devises trouble, vexation, and evil continually; he lets loose discord and sows it.",
  "15": "Therefore upon him shall the crushing weight of calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken, and that without remedy.",
  "16": "These six things the Lord hates, indeed, seven are an abomination to Him:",
  "17": "A proud look [the spirit that makes one overestimate himself and underestimate others], a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, [Ps. 120:2, 3.]",
  "18": "A heart that manufactures wicked thoughts and plans, feet that are swift in running to evil,",
  "19": "A false witness who breathes out lies [even under oath], and he who sows discord among his brethren.",
  "20": "My son, keep your father's [God-given] commandment and forsake not the law of [God] your mother [taught you]. [Eph. 6:1-3.]",
  "21": "Bind them continually upon your heart and tie them about your neck. [Prov. 3:3; 7:3.]",
  "22": "When you go, they [the words of your parents' God] shall lead you; when you sleep, they shall keep you; and when you waken, they shall talk with you.",
  "23": "For the commandment is a lamp, and the whole teaching [of the law] is light, and reproofs of discipline are the way of life, [Ps. 19:8; 119:105.]",
  "24": "To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a loose woman.",
  "25": "Lust not after her beauty in your heart, neither let her capture you with her eyelids.",
  "26": "For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread, and the adulteress stalks and snares [as with a hook] the precious life [of a man].",
  "27": "Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?",
  "28": "Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned?",
  "29": "So he who cohabits with his neighbor's wife [will be tortured with evil consequences and just retribution]; he who touches her shall not be innocent or go unpunished.",
  "30": "Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;",
  "31": "But if he is found out, he must restore seven times [what he stole]; he must give the whole substance of his house [if necessary--to meet his fine].",
  "32": "But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks heart and understanding (moral principle and prudence); he who does it is destroying his own life.",
  "33": "Wounds and disgrace will he get, and his reproach will not be wiped away.",
  "34": "For jealousy makes [the wronged] man furious; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance [upon the detected one].",
  "35": "He will not consider any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment]; neither will he be satisfied, though you offer him many gifts and bribes."
