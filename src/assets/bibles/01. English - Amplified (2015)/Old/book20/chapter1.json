  "3": "Receive instruction in wise dealing and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness, righteousness, justice, and integrity,",
  "4": "That prudence may be given to the simple, and knowledge, discretion, and discernment to the youth--",
  "5": "The wise also will hear and increase in learning, and the person of understanding will acquire skill and attain to sound counsel [so that he may be able to steer his course rightly]--[Prov. 9:9.]",
  "6": "That people may understand a proverb and a figure of speech or an enigma with its interpretation, and the words of the wise and their dark sayings or riddles.",
  "7": "The reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning and the principal and choice part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence]; but fools despise skillful and godly Wisdom, instruction, and discipline. [Ps. 111:10.]",
  "8": "My son, hear the instruction of your father; reject not nor forsake the teaching of your mother.",
  "9": "For they are a [victor's] chaplet (garland) of grace upon your head and chains and pendants [of gold worn by kings] for your neck.",
  "10": "My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. [Ps. 1:1; Eph. 5:11.]",
  "11": "If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait [to shed] blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause [and show that his piety is in vain];",
  "12": "Let us swallow them up alive as does Sheol (the place of the dead), and whole, as those who go down into the pit [of the dead];",
  "13": "We shall find and take all kinds of precious goods [when our victims are put out of the way], we shall fill our houses with plunder;",
  "14": "Throw in your lot with us [they insist] and be a sworn brother and comrade; let us all have one purse in common--",
  "15": "My son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path;",
  "16": "For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.",
  "17": "For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird!",
  "18": "But [when these men set a trap for others] they are lying in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.",
  "19": "So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; such [greed for plunder] takes away the lives of its possessors. [Prov. 15:27; I Tim. 6:10.]",
  "20": "Wisdom cries aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the markets;",
  "21": "She cries at the head of the noisy intersections [in the chief gathering places]; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:",
  "22": "How long, O simple ones [open to evil], will you love being simple? And the scoffers delight in scoffing and [self-confident] fools hate knowledge?",
  "23": "If you will turn (repent) and give heed to my reproof, behold, I [Wisdom] will pour out my spirit upon you, I will make my words known to you. [Isa. 11:2; Eph. 1:17-20.]",
  "24": "Because I have called and you have refused [to answer], have stretched out my hand and no man has heeded it, [Isa. 65:11, 12; 66:4; Jer. 7:13, 14; Zech. 7:11-13.]",
  "25": "And you treated as nothing all my counsel and would accept none of my reproof,",
  "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when the thing comes that shall cause you terror and panic--",
  "27": "When your panic comes as a storm and desolation and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.",
  "28": "Then will they call upon me [Wisdom] but I will not answer; they will seek me early and diligently but they will not find me. [Job 27:9; 35:12, 13; Isa. 1:15, 16; Jer. 11:11; Mic. 3:4; James 4:3.]",
  "29": "Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord, [Prov. 8:13.]",
  "30": "Would accept none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,",
  "31": "Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated with their own devices.",
  "32": "For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, and the careless ease of [self-confident] fools shall destroy them. [Isa. 32:6.]",
  "33": "But whoso hearkens to me [Wisdom] shall dwell securely and in confident trust and shall be quiet, without fear or dread of evil."
