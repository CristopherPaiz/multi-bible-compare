  "1": "A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. IT IS a good and delightful thing to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises [with musical accompaniment] to Your name, O Most High,",
  "2": "To show forth Your loving-kindness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night,",
  "3": "With an instrument of ten strings and with the lute, with a solemn sound upon the lyre.",
  "4": "For You, O Lord, have made me glad by Your works; at the deeds of Your hands I joyfully sing.",
  "5": "How great are Your doings, O Lord! Your thoughts are very deep.",
  "6": "A man in his rude and uncultivated state knows not, neither does a [self-confident] fool understand this:",

  "8": "But You, Lord, are on high forever.",
  "9": "For behold, Your adversaries, O Lord, for behold, Your enemies shall perish; all the evildoers shall be scattered.",

  "13": "Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall flourish in the courts of our God.",
