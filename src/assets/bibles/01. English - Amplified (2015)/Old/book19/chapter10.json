  "1": "WHY DO You stand afar off, O Lord? Why do You hide Yourself, [veiling Your eyes] in times of trouble (distress and desperation)?",
  "2": "The wicked in pride and arrogance hotly pursue and persecute the poor; let them be taken in the schemes which they have devised.",
  "3": "For the wicked man boasts (sings the praises) of his own heart's desire, and the one greedy for gain curses and spurns, yes, renounces and despises the Lord.",
  "4": "The wicked one in the pride of his countenance will not seek, inquire for, and yearn for God; all his thoughts are that there is no God [so He never punishes].",
  "5": "His ways are grievous [or persist] at all times; Your judgments [Lord] are far above and on high out of his sight [so he never thinks about them]; as for all his foes, he sniffs and sneers at them.",
  "6": "He thinks in his heart, I shall not be moved; for throughout all generations I shall not come to want or be in adversity.",
  "7": "His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, oppression (fraud); under his tongue are trouble and sin (mischief and iniquity).",
  "8": "He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he slays the innocent; he watches stealthily for the poor (the helpless and unfortunate).",
  "9": "He lurks in secret places like a lion in his thicket; he lies in wait that he may seize the poor (the helpless and the unfortunate); he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.",

  "11": "[The foe] thinks in his heart, God has quite forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see [my deed].",
  "12": "Arise, O Lord! O God, lift up Your hand; forget not the humble [patient and crushed].",
  "13": "Why does the wicked [man] condemn (spurn and renounce) God? Why has he thought in his heart, You will not call to account?",
  "14": "You have seen it; yes, You note trouble and grief (vexation) to requite it with Your hand. The unfortunate commits himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.",
  "15": "Break the arm of the wicked man; and as for the evil man, search out his wickedness until You find no more.",
  "16": "The Lord is King forever and ever; the nations will perish out of His land.",
  "17": "O Lord, You have heard the desire and the longing of the humble and oppressed; You will prepare and strengthen and direct their hearts, You will cause Your ear to hear,",
  "18": "To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man, who is of the earth, may not terrify them any more."
