  "6": "They slay the widow and the transient stranger and murder the unprotected orphan.",
  "7": "Yet they say, The Lord does not see, neither does the God of Jacob notice it.",
  "8": "Consider and understand, you stupid ones among the people! And you [self-confident] fools, when will you become wise?",
  "9": "He Who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He Who formed the eye, shall He not see?",
  "10": "He Who disciplines and instructs the nations, shall He not punish, He Who teaches man knowledge?",

  "21": "They band themselves together against the life of the [consistently] righteous and condemn the innocent to death.",
  "22": "But the Lord has become my High Tower and Defense, and my God the Rock of my refuge.",
  "23": "And He will turn back upon them their own iniquity and will wipe them out by means of their own wickedness; the Lord our God will wipe them out."
