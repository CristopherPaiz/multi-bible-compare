  "5": "Behold, I was brought forth in [a state of] iniquity; my mother was sinful who conceived me [and I too am sinful]. [John 3:6; Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:3.]",
  "6": "Behold, You desire truth in the inner being; make me therefore to know wisdom in my inmost heart.",
  "7": "Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean [ceremonially]; wash me, and I shall [in reality] be whiter than snow.",

  "15": "O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.",
  "16": "For You delight not in sacrifice, or else would I give it; You find no pleasure in burnt offering. [I Sam. 15:22.]",
  "17": "My sacrifice [the sacrifice acceptable] to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart [broken down with sorrow for sin and humbly and thoroughly penitent], such, O God, You will not despise.",
  "18": "Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.",
  "19": "Then will You delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, justice, and right, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then bullocks will be offered upon Your altar."
