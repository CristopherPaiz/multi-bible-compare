  "1": "To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. HEAR THIS, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,",
  "2": "Both low and high, rich and poor together:",
  "3": "My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.",
  "4": "I will submit and consent to a parable or proverb; to the music of a lyre I will unfold my riddle (my problem).",
  "5": "Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of those who would supplant me surrounds me on every side,",
  "6": "Even of those who trust in and lean on their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?",
  "7": "None of them can by any means redeem [either himself or] his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him--",
  "8": "For the ransom of a life is too costly, and [the price one can pay] can never suffice--",
  "9": "So that he should live on forever and never see the pit (the grave) and corruption.",
  "10": "For he sees that even wise men die; the [self-confident] fool and the stupid alike perish and leave their wealth to others.",
  "11": "Their inward thought is that their houses will continue forever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands their own [apart from God] and after their own names.",
  "12": "But man, with all his honor and pomp, does not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.",
  "13": "This is the fate of those who are foolishly confident, yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "14": "Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol (the place of the dead); death shall be their shepherd. And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form and beauty shall be consumed, for Sheol shall be their dwelling.",
  "15": "But God will redeem me from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead); for He will receive me. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "16": "Be not afraid when [an ungodly] one is made rich, when the wealth and glory of his house are increased;",
  "17": "For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not descend after him.",
  "18": "Though while he lives he counts himself happy and prosperous, and though a man gets praise when he does well [for himself],",
  "19": "He will go to the generation of his fathers, who will nevermore see the light.",
  "20": "A man who is held in honor and understands not is like the beasts that perish."
