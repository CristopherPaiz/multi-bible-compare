  "1": "A Psalm of David. LORD, WHO shall dwell [temporarily] in Your tabernacle? Who shall dwell [permanently] on Your holy hill?",
  "2": "He who walks and lives uprightly and blamelessly, who works rightness and justice and speaks and thinks the truth in his heart,",
  "3": "He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;",
  "4": "In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he who honors those who fear the Lord (who revere and worship Him); who swears to his own hurt and does not change;",
  "5": "[He who] does not put out his money for interest [to one of his own people] and who will not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved. [Exod. 22:25, 26.]"
