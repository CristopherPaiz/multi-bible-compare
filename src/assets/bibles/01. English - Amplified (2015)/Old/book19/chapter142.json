  "1": "A skillful song, or a didactic or reflective poem, of David; when he was in the cave. A Prayer. I CRY to the Lord with my voice; with my voice to the Lord do I make supplication.",
  "2": "I pour out my complaint before Him; I tell before Him my trouble.",
  "3": "When my spirit was overwhelmed and fainted [throwing all its weight] upon me, then You knew my path. In the way where I walk they have hidden a snare for me.",
  "4": "Look on the right hand [the point of attack] and see; for there is no man who knows me [to appear for me]. Refuge has failed me and I have no way to flee; no man cares for my life or my welfare.",
  "5": "I cried to You, O Lord; I said, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.",
  "6": "Attend to my loud cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.",
  "7": "Bring my life out of prison, that I may confess, praise, and give thanks to Your name; the righteous will surround me and crown themselves because of me, for You will deal bountifully with me."
