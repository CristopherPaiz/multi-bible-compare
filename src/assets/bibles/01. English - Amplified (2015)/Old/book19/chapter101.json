  "1": "A Psalm of David. I WILL sing of mercy and loving-kindness and justice; to You, O Lord, will I sing.",
  "2": "I will behave myself wisely and give heed to the blameless way--O when will You come to me? I will walk within my house in integrity and with a blameless heart.",
  "3": "I will set no base or wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of them who turn aside [from the right path]; it shall not grasp hold of me.",
  "4": "A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil person or thing.",
  "5": "Whoso privily slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off [from me]; he who has a haughty look and a proud and arrogant heart I cannot and I will not tolerate.",
  "6": "My eyes shall [look with favor] upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks blamelessly, he shall minister to me.",
  "7": "He who works deceit shall not dwell in my house; he who tells lies shall not continue in my presence.",
  "8": "Morning after morning I will root up all the wicked in the land, that I may eliminate all the evildoers from the city of the Lord."
