  "1": "To the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. A skillful song, or a didactic or reflective poem. WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us [what] work You did in their days, in the days of old.",
  "2": "You drove out the nations with Your hand and it was Your power that gave [Israel] a home by rooting out the [heathen] peoples, but [Israel] You spread out.",
  "3": "For they got not the land [of Canaan] in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your countenance [did it], because You were favorable toward and did delight in them.",
  "4": "You are my King, O God; command victories and deliverance for Jacob (Israel).",

  "7": "But You have saved us from our foes and have put them to shame who hate us.",
  "8": "In God we have made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",

  "13": "You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us.",

  "21": "Would not God discover this? For He knows the secrets of the heart.",
  "22": "No, but for Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. [Rom. 8:35-39.]",
  "23": "Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arouse Yourself, cast us not off forever!",
  "24": "Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and our oppression?",
  "25": "For our lives are bowed down to the dust; our bodies cleave to the ground.",
