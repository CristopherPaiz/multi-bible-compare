  "1": "An Ode of David, [probably] in a wild, irregular, enthusiastic strain, which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, in You I take refuge and put my trust; save me from all those who pursue and persecute me, and deliver me,",
  "2": "Lest my foe tear my life [from my body] like a lion, dragging me away while there is none to deliver.",
  "3": "O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,",
  "4": "If I have paid back with evil him who was at peace with me or without cause have robbed him who was my enemy,",
  "5": "Let the enemy pursue my life and take it; yes, let him trample my life to the ground and lay my honor in the dust. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "6": "Arise, O Lord, in Your anger; lift up Yourself against the rage of my enemies; and awake [and stir up] for me the justice and vindication [that] You have commanded.",
  "7": "Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about You, and return on high over them.",
  "8": "The Lord judges the people; judge me, O Lord, and do me justice according to my righteousness [my rightness, justice, and right standing with You] and according to the integrity that is in me.",
  "9": "Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the [uncompromisingly] righteous [those upright and in harmony with You]; for You, Who try the hearts and emotions and thinking powers, are a righteous God. [Rev. 2:23.]",
  "10": "My defense and shield depend on God, Who saves the upright in heart.",
  "11": "God is a righteous Judge, yes, a God Who is indignant every day.",
  "12": "If a man does not turn and repent, [God] will whet His sword; He has strung and bent His [huge] bow and made it ready [by treading it with His foot].",
  "13": "He has also prepared for him deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.",
  "14": "Behold, [the wicked man] conceives iniquity and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.",
  "15": "He made a pit and hollowed it out and has fallen into the hole which he made [before the trap was completed].",
  "16": "His mischief shall fall back in return upon his own head, and his violence come down [with the loose dirt] upon his own scalp.",
  "17": "I will give to the Lord the thanks due to His rightness and justice, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High."
