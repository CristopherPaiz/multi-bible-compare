  "1": "To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. DELIVER ME, O Lord, from evil men; preserve me from violent men;",
  "2": "They devise mischiefs in their heart; continually they gather together and stir up wars.",
  "3": "They sharpen their tongues like a serpent's; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! [Rom. 3:13.]",
  "4": "Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent men who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.",
  "5": "The proud have hidden a snare for me; they have spread cords as a net by the wayside, they have set traps for me. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "6": "I said to the Lord, You are my God; give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Lord.",
  "7": "O God the Lord, the Strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.",
  "8": "Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not their wicked plot and device, lest they exalt themselves. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "9": "Those who are fencing me in raise their heads; may the mischief of their own lips and the very things they desire for me come upon them.",
  "10": "Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into floods of water or deep water pits, from which they shall not rise.",
  "11": "Let not a man of slanderous tongue be established in the earth; let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him [let calamity follow his evildoings].",
  "12": "I know and rest in confidence upon it that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will secure justice for the poor and needy [of His believing children].",
  "13": "Surely the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall give thanks to Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence (before Your very face)."
