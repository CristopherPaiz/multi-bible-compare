  "1": "A Psalm of David; to bring to remembrance and make memorial. O LORD, rebuke me not in Your wrath, neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure.",
  "2": "For Your arrows have sunk into me and stick fast, and Your hand has come down upon me and pressed me sorely.",
  "3": "There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation; neither is there any health or rest in my bones because of my sin.",
  "4": "For my iniquities have gone over my head [like waves of a flood]; as a heavy burden they weigh too much for me.",
  "5": "My wounds are loathsome and corrupt because of my foolishness.",
  "6": "I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go about mourning all the day long.",
  "7": "For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh.",
  "8": "I am faint and sorely bruised [deadly cold and quite worn out]; I groan by reason of the disquiet and moaning of my heart.",
  "9": "Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You.",
  "10": "My heart throbs, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.",
  "11": "My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my neighbors and my near ones stand afar off. [Luke 23:49.]",
  "12": "They also that seek and demand my life lay snares for me, and they that seek and require my hurt speak crafty and mischievous things; they meditate treachery and deceit all the day long.",
  "13": "But I, like a deaf man, hear not; and I am like a dumb man who opens not his mouth.",
  "14": "Yes, I have become like a man who hears not, in whose mouth are no arguments or replies.",
  "15": "For in You, O Lord, do I hope; You will answer, O Lord my God.",
  "16": "For I pray, Let them not rejoice over me, who when my foot slips boast against me.",
  "17": "For I am ready to halt and fall; my pain and sorrow are continually before me.",
  "18": "For I do confess my guilt and iniquity; I am filled with sorrow for my sin. [II Cor. 7:9, 10.]",
  "19": "But my enemies are vigorous and strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.",
  "20": "They also that render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.",
  "21": "Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me.",
  "22": "Make haste to help me, O Lord, my Salvation."
