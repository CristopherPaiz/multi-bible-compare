  "1": "THE LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is robed, He has girded Himself with strength and power; the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.",
  "2": "Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.",
  "3": "The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up the roaring of their waves.",
  "4": "The Lord on high is mightier and more glorious than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty breakers and waves of the sea.",
  "5": "Your testimonies are very sure; holiness [apparent in separation from sin, with simple trust and hearty obedience] is becoming to Your house, O Lord, forever."
