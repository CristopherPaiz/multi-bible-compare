  "1": "To the Chief Musician; [set to the tune of]``Do Not Destroy.\" A record of memorable thoughts of David. DO YOU indeed in silence speak righteousness, O you mighty ones? [Or is the righteousness, rightness, and justice you should speak quite dumb?] Do you judge fairly and uprightly, O you sons of men?",
  "2": "No, in your heart you devise wickedness; you deal out in the land the violence of your hands.",
  "3": "The ungodly are perverse and estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.",
  "4": "Their poison is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder or asp that stops its ear,",
  "5": "Which listens not to the voice of charmers or of the enchanter never casting spells so cunningly.",
  "6": "Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord.",
  "7": "Let them melt away as water which runs on apace; when he aims his arrows, let them be as if they were headless or split apart.",
  "8": "Let them be as a snail dissolving slime as it passes on or as a festering sore which wastes away, like [the child to which] a woman gives untimely birth that has not seen the sun.",
  "9": "Before your pots can feel the thorns [that are placed under them for fuel], He will take them away as with a whirlwind, the green and the burning ones alike.",
  "10": "The [unyieldingly] righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.",
  "11": "Men will say, Surely there is a reward for the [uncompromisingly] righteous; surely there is a God Who judges on the earth."
