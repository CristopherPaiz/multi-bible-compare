  "1": "[A Psalm] of David. BLESSED BE the Lord, my Rock and my keen and firm Strength, Who teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight--",
  "2": "My Steadfast Love and my Fortress, my High Tower and my Deliverer, my Shield and He in Whom I trust and take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.",
  "3": "Lord, what is man that You take notice of him? Or [the] son of man that You take account of him? [Job 7:17; Ps. 8:4; Heb. 2:6.]",
  "4": "Man is like vanity and a breath; his days are as a shadow that passes away.",
  "5": "Bow Your heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.",
  "6": "Cast forth lightning and scatter [my enemies]; send out Your arrows and embarrass and frustrate them.",
  "7": "Stretch forth Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hands of hostile aliens (tribes around us)",
  "8": "Whose mouths speak deceit and whose right hands are right hands [raised in taking] fraudulent oaths.",
  "9": "I will sing a new song to You, O God; upon a harp, an instrument of ten strings, will I offer praises to You.",
  "10": "You are He Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David His servant from the hurtful sword [of evil].",
  "11": "Rescue me and deliver me out of the power of [hostile] alien [tribes] whose mouths speak deceit and whose right hands are right hands [raised in taking] fraudulent oaths.",
  "12": "When our sons shall be as plants grown large in their youth and our daughters as sculptured corner pillars hewn like those of a palace;",
  "13": "When our garners are full, affording all manner of store, and our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our pastures;",
  "14": "When our oxen are well loaded; when there is no invasion [of hostile armies] and no going forth [against besiegers--when there is no murder or manslaughter] and no outcry in our streets;",
  "15": "Happy and blessed are the people who are in such a case; yes, happy (blessed, fortunate, prosperous, to be envied) are the people whose God is the Lord!"
