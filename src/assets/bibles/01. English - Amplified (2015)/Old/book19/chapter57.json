  "1": "To the Chief Musician; [set to the tune of]``Do Not Destroy.\" A record of memorable thoughts of David when he fled from Saul in the cave. BE MERCIFUL and gracious to me, O God, be merciful and gracious to me, for my soul takes refuge and finds shelter and confidence in You; yes, in the shadow of Your wings will I take refuge and be confident until calamities and destructive storms are passed.",
  "2": "I will cry to God Most High, Who performs on my behalf and rewards me [Who brings to pass His purposes for me and surely completes them]!",
  "3": "He will send from heaven and save me from the slanders and reproaches of him who would trample me down or swallow me up, and He will put him to shame. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! God will send forth His mercy and loving-kindness and His truth and faithfulness.",
  "4": "My life is among lions; I must lie among those who are aflame--the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, their tongues sharp swords.",
  "5": "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let Your glory be over all the earth!",
  "6": "They set a net for my steps; my very life was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way; into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "7": "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is steadfast and confident! I will sing and make melody.",
  "8": "Awake, my glory (my inner self); awake, harp and lyre! I will awake right early [I will awaken the dawn]!",
  "9": "I will praise and give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.",
  "10": "For Your mercy and loving-kindness are great, reaching to the heavens, and Your truth and faithfulness to the clouds.",
  "11": "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be over all the earth."
