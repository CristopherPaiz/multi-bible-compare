  "1": "To the Chief Musician; [set to the tune of]``The Lily of the Testimony.\" A poem of David intended to record memorable thoughts and to teach; when he had striven with the Arameans of Mesopotamia and the Arameans of Zobah, and when Joab returned and smote twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. O GOD, You have rejected us and cast us off, broken down [our defenses], and scattered us; You have been angry--O restore us and turn Yourself to us again!",
  "2": "You have made the land to quake and tremble, You have rent it [open]; repair its breaches, for it shakes and totters.",
  "3": "You have made Your people suffer hard things; You have given us to drink wine that makes us reel and be dazed.",
  "4": "[But now] You have set up a banner for those who fear and worshipfully revere You [to which they may flee from the bow], a standard displayed because of the truth. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "5": "That Your beloved ones may be delivered, save with Your right hand and answer us [or me].",
  "6": "God has spoken in His holiness [in His promises]: I will rejoice, I will divide and portion out [the land] Shechem and the Valley of Succoth [west to east].",
  "7": "Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is My helmet (the defense of My head); Judah is My scepter and My lawgiver.",
  "8": "Moab is My washpot [reduced to vilest servitude]; upon Edom I cast My shoe in triumph; over Philistia I raise the shout of victory.",
  "9": "Who will bring me [David] into the strong city [of Petra]? Who will lead me into Edom?",
  "10": "Have You not rejected us, O God? And will You not go forth, O God, with our armies?",
  "11": "O give us help against the adversary, for vain (ineffectual and to no purpose) is the help or salvation of man.",
  "12": "Through God we shall do valiantly, for He it is Who shall tread down our adversaries."
