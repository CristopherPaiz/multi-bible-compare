  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. TRULY GOD is [only] good to Israel, even to those who are upright and pure in heart.",
  "2": "But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped.",
  "3": "For I was envious of the foolish and arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.",
  "4": "For they suffer no violent pangs in their death, but their strength is firm.",
  "5": "They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they smitten and plagued like other men.",
  "6": "Therefore pride is about their necks like a chain; violence covers them like a garment [like a long, luxurious robe].",
  "7": "Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish; and the imaginations of their minds overflow [with follies].",
  "8": "They scoff, and wickedly utter oppression; they speak loftily [from on high, maliciously and blasphemously].",
  "9": "They set their mouths against and speak down from heaven, and their tongues swagger through the earth [invading even heaven with blasphemy and smearing earth with slanders]. [Rev. 13:6.]",
  "10": "Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full cup [offered by the wicked] are [blindly] drained by them.",
  "11": "And they say, How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?",
  "12": "Behold, these are the ungodly, who always prosper and are at ease in the world; they increase in riches.",
  "13": "Surely then in vain have I cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency.",
  "14": "For all the day long have I been smitten and plagued, and chastened every morning.",
  "15": "Had I spoken thus [and given expression to my feelings], I would have been untrue and have dealt treacherously against the generation of Your children.",
  "16": "But when I considered how to understand this, it was too great an effort for me and too painful",
  "17": "Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood [for I considered] their end.",
  "18": "[After all] You do set the [wicked] in slippery places; You cast them down to ruin and destruction.",
  "19": "How they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors!",
  "20": "As a dream [which seems real] until one awakens, so, O Lord, when You arouse Yourself [to take note of the wicked], You will despise their outward show.",
  "21": "For my heart was grieved, embittered, and in a state of ferment, and I was pricked in my heart [as with the sharp fang of an adder].",
  "22": "So foolish, stupid, and brutish was I, and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.",
  "23": "Nevertheless I am continually with You; You do hold my right hand.",
  "24": "You will guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to honor and glory.",
  "25": "Whom have I in heaven but You? And I have no delight or desire on earth besides You.",
  "26": "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the Rock and firm Strength of my heart and my Portion forever.",
  "27": "For behold, those who are far from You shall perish; You will destroy all who are false to You and like [spiritual] harlots depart from You.",
  "28": "But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God and made Him my refuge, that I may tell of all Your works."
