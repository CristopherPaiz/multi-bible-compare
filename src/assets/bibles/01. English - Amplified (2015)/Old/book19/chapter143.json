  "1": "A Psalm of David. HEAR MY prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, and in Your righteousness.",

  "5": "I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your doings; I ponder the work of Your hands.",
  "6": "I spread forth my hands to You; my soul thirsts after You like a thirsty land [for water]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "7": "Answer me speedily, O Lord, for my spirit fails; hide not Your face from me, lest I become like those who go down into the pit (the grave).",
