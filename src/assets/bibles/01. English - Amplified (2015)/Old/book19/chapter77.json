  "1": "To the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun [one of David's three chief musicians, founder of an official musical family]. A Psalm of Asaph. I WILL cry to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and He will give ear and hearken to me.",
  "2": "In the day of my trouble I seek (inquire of and desperately require) the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out [in prayer] without slacking up; I refuse to be comforted.",
  "3": "I [earnestly] remember God; I am disquieted and I groan; I muse in prayer, and my spirit faints [overwhelmed]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "4": "You hold my eyes from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.",
  "5": "I consider the days of old, the years of bygone times [of prosperity].",
  "6": "I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my heart I meditate and my spirit searches diligently:",
  "7": "Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more?",
  "8": "Have His mercy and loving-kindness ceased forever? Have His promises ended for all time?",
  "9": "Has God [deliberately] abandoned or forgotten His graciousness? Has He in anger shut up His compassion? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "10": "And I say, This [apparent desertion of Israel by God] is my appointed lot and trial, but I will recall the years of the right hand of the Most High [in loving-kindness extended toward us], for this is my grief, that the right hand of the Most High changes.",
  "11": "I will [earnestly] recall the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will [earnestly] remember the wonders [You performed for our fathers] of old.",
  "12": "I will meditate also upon all Your works and consider all Your [mighty] deeds.",
  "13": "Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary [in holiness, away from sin and guilt]. Who is a great God like our God?",
  "14": "You are the God Who does wonders; You have demonstrated Your power among the peoples.",
  "15": "You have with Your [mighty] arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "16": "When the waters [at the Red Sea and the Jordan] saw You, O God, they were afraid; the deep shuddered also, for [all] the waters saw You.",
  "17": "The clouds poured down water, the skies sent out a sound [of rumbling thunder]; Your arrows went forth [in forked lightning].",
  "18": "The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind, the lightnings illumined the world; the earth trembled and shook.",
  "19": "Your way [in delivering Your people] was through the sea, and Your paths through the great waters, yet Your footsteps were not traceable, but were obliterated.",
  "20": "You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron."
