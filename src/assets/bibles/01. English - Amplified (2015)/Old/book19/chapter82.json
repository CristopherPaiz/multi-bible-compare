  "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. GOD STANDS in the assembly [of the representatives] of God; in the midst of the magistrates or judges He gives judgment [as] among the gods.",
  "2": "How long will you [magistrates or judges] judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "3": "Do justice to the weak (poor) and fatherless; maintain the rights of the afflicted and needy.",
  "4": "Deliver the poor and needy; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked.",
  "5": "[The magistrates and judges] know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in the darkness [of complacent satisfaction]; all the foundations of the earth [the fundamental principles upon which rests the administration of justice] are shaking.",
  "6": "I said, You are gods [since you judge on My behalf, as My representatives]; indeed, all of you are children of the Most High. [John 10:34-36; Rom. 13:1, 2.]",
  "7": "But you shall die as men and fall as one of the princes.",
  "8": "Arise, O God, judge the earth! For to You belong all the nations. [Rev. 11:15.]"
