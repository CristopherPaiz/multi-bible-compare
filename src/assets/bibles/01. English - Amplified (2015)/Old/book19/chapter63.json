  "1": "A Psalm of David; when he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O GOD, You are my God, earnestly will I seek You; my inner self thirsts for You, my flesh longs and is faint for You, in a dry and weary land where no water is.",
  "2": "So I have looked upon You in the sanctuary to see Your power and Your glory.",
  "3": "Because Your loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.",
  "4": "So will I bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.",
  "5": "My whole being shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips",
  "6": "When I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches.",
  "7": "For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.",
  "8": "My whole being follows hard after You and clings closely to You; Your right hand upholds me.",
  "9": "But those who seek and demand my life to ruin and destroy it shall [themselves be destroyed and] go into the lower parts of the earth [into the underworld of the dead].",
  "10": "They shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be a prey for foxes and jackals.",
  "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone who swears by Him [that is, who binds himself by God's authority, acknowledging His supremacy, and devoting himself to His glory and service alone; every such one] shall glory, for the mouths of those who speak lies shall be stopped."
