  "1": "A Psalm of David. When he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, HOW they are increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me.",
  "2": "Many are saying of me, There is no help for him in God. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "3": "But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.",
  "4": "With my voice I cry to the Lord, and He hears and answers me out of His holy hill. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!",
  "5": "I lay down and slept; I wakened again, for the Lord sustains me.",
  "6": "I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about.",
  "7": "Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.",
  "8": "Salvation belongs to the Lord; May Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!"
