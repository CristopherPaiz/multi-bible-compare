  "1": "To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. HEAR MY voice, O God, in my complaint; guard and preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.",
  "2": "Hide me from the secret counsel and conspiracy of the ungodly, from the scheming of evildoers,",
  "3": "Who whet their tongues like a sword, who aim venomous words like arrows,",
  "4": "Who shoot from ambush at the blameless man; suddenly do they shoot at him, without self-reproach or fear.",
  "5": "They encourage themselves in an evil purpose, they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who will discover us?",
  "6": "They think out acts of injustice and say, We have accomplished a well-devised thing! For the inward thought of each one [is unsearchable] and his heart is deep.",
  "7": "But God will shoot an unexpected arrow at them; and suddenly shall they be wounded.",
  "8": "And they will be made to stumble, their own tongues turning against them; all who gaze upon them will shake their heads and flee away.",
  "9": "And all men shall [reverently] fear and be in awe; and they will declare the work of God, for they will wisely consider and acknowledge that it is His doing.",
  "10": "The [uncompromisingly] righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust and take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory and offer praise."
