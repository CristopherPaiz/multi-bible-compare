  "1": "To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. THE HEAVENS declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows and proclaims His handiwork. [Rom. 1:20, 21.]",
  "2": "Day after day pours forth speech, and night after night shows forth knowledge.",
  "3": "There is no speech nor spoken word [from the stars]; their voice is not heard.",
  "4": "Yet their voice [in evidence] goes out through all the earth, their sayings to the end of the world. Of the heavens has God made a tent for the sun, [Rom. 10:18.]",
  "5": "Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; and it rejoices as a strong man to run his course.",
  "6": "Its going forth is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the ends of it; and nothing [yes, no one] is hidden from the heat of it.",
  "7": "The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the [whole] person; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.",
  "8": "The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure and bright, enlightening the eyes.",
  "9": "The [reverent] fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.",
  "10": "More to be desired are they than gold, even than much fine gold; they are sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb.",
  "11": "Moreover, by them is Your servant warned (reminded, illuminated, and instructed); and in keeping them there is great reward.",
  "12": "Who can discern his lapses and errors? Clear me from hidden [and unconscious] faults.",
  "13": "Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be blameless, and I shall be innocent and clear of great transgression.",
  "14": "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my [firm, impenetrable] Rock and my Redeemer."
