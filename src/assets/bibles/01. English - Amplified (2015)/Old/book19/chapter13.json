  "1": "To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. HOW LONG will You forget me, O Lord? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?",
  "2": "How long must I lay up cares within me and have sorrow in my heart day after day? How long shall my enemy exalt himself over me?",
  "3": "Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; lighten the eyes [of my faith to behold Your face in the pitchlike darkness], lest I sleep the sleep of death,",
  "4": "Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed over him, and those that trouble me rejoice when I am shaken.",
  "5": "But I have trusted, leaned on, and been confident in Your mercy and loving-kindness; my heart shall rejoice and be in high spirits in Your salvation.",
  "6": "I will sing to the Lord, because He has dealt bountifully with me."
