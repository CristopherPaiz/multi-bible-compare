  "7": "Drinks were served in different kinds of golden goblets, and there was royal wine in abundance, according to the liberality of the king.",
  "8": "And drinking was according to the law; no one was compelled to drink, for the king had directed all the officials of his palace to serve only as each guest desired.",
