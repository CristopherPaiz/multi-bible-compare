  "1": "NOW PASHHUR son of Immer, the priest, who was [also] chief officer in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.",
  "2": "Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate by the house of the Lord. [Jer. 1:19; 15:15.]",
  "3": "And the next day Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, The Lord does not call your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib [terror on every side].",
  "4": "For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; they will fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he will carry them captive to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.",
  "5": "Moreover, I will deliver all the riches of this city--all the results of its labors, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah--into the hand of their enemies, who will make them a prey and plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.",
  "6": "And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; you shall go to Babylon, and there you shall die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.",
  "7": "[But Jeremiah said] O Lord, You have persuaded and deceived me, and I was persuaded and deceived; You are stronger than I am and You have prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.",
  "8": "For whenever I speak, I must cry out and complain; I shout, Violence and destruction! For the word of the Lord has become to me a reproach and a derision and has brought me insult all day long.",
  "9": "If I say, I will not make mention of [the Lord] or speak any more in His name, in my mind and heart it is as if there were a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I am weary of enduring and holding it in; I cannot [contain it any longer].",
  "10": "For I have heard many whispering and defaming, [There is] terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him! Say all my familiar friends, they who watch for my fall, Perhaps he will be persuaded and deceived; then we will prevail against him, and we will get our revenge on him.",
  "11": "But the Lord is with me as a mighty and terrible One; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not overcome [me]. They will be utterly put to shame, for they will not deal wisely or prosper [in their schemes]; their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.",
  "12": "But, O Lord of hosts, You Who try the righteous, Who see the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for to You have I revealed and committed my cause.",
  "13": "Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor and needy from the hands of evildoers.",
  "14": "Cursed be the day on which I was born! Let not the day on which my mother bore me be blessed!",
  "15": "Cursed be the man who brought the tidings to my father, saying, A son is born to you!--making him very glad.",
  "16": "And let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew, and did not relent. Let him hear the [war] cry in the morning and the shouting of alarm at noon,",
  "17": "Because he did not slay me in the womb, so that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always great.",
  "18": "Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?"
