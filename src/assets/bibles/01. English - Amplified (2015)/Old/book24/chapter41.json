  "1": "NOW IN the seventh month [of that year] Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal descendants and one of the princes of the king, came [at the instigation of the Ammonites] with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam in Mizpah. As they were eating a meal together there in Mizpah,",
  "2": "Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him, the one whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. [II Kings 25:25.]",
  "3": "Ishmael [manipulated by the Ammonites] also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.",
  "4": "And the second day after the slaying of Gedaliah, before anyone knew about it,",
  "5": "There came eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, having their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and having cut themselves, bringing cereal offerings and incense, going up [to Jerusalem] to present them in the house of the Lord.",
  "6": "And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all the way as he went. As he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.",
  "7": "And when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the [city] cistern pit--he and the men with him.",
  "8": "But ten men were among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us! For we have stores hidden in the field--of wheat and barley and oil and honey. So he refrained and did not slay them with their brethren.",
  "9": "Now the cistern pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain in addition to Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king [of Judah] had once made for fear of Baasha king of Israel [should Baasha lay siege to Mizpah]. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.",
  "10": "Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah--even the king's daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to cross over [the Jordan] to the Ammonites.",
  "11": "But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,",
  "12": "They took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.",
  "13": "Now when all the people who were [captives] with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him, they were glad.",
  "14": "So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan son of Kareah.",
  "15": "But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.",
  "16": "Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remainder of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam: [they were] the soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs whom [Johanan] had brought back from Gibeon.",
  "17": "And they departed and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, [intending] to go to Egypt",
  "18": "Because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land [and whose death the king could avenge without much discrimination]."
