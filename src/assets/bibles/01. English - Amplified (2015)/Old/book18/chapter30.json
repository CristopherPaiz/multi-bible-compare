  "1": "BUT NOW they who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.",
  "2": "Yes, how could the strength of their hands profit me? They were men whose ripe age and vigor had perished.",
  "3": "They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry and barren ground or flee into the wilderness, into the gloom of wasteness and desolation.",
  "4": "They pluck saltwort or mallows among the bushes, and roots of the broom for their food or to warm them.",
  "5": "They are driven from among men, who shout after them as after a thief.",
  "6": "They must dwell in the clefts of frightful valleys (gullies made by torrents) and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.",
  "7": "Among the bushes they bray and howl [like wild animals]; beneath the prickly scrub they fling themselves and huddle together.",
  "8": "Sons of the worthless and nameless, they have been scourged and crushed out of the land.",
  "9": "And now I have become their song; yes, I am a byword to them.",
  "10": "They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and do not refrain from spitting in my face or at the sight of me.",
  "11": "For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted and humbled me; they have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me.",
  "12": "On my right hand rises the rabble brood; they jostle me and push away my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction [like an advancing army].",
  "13": "They break up and clutter my path [embarrassing my plans]; they urge on my calamity, even though they have no helper [and are themselves helpless].",
  "14": "As through a wide breach they come in; amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll themselves upon me.",
  "15": "Terrors are turned upon me; my honor and reputation they chase away like the wind, and my welfare has passed away as a cloud.",
  "16": "And now my life is poured out within me; the days of affliction have gripped me.",
  "17": "My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.",
  "18": "By the great force [of my disease] my garment is disguised and disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my coat.",
  "19": "[God] has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.",
  "20": "I cry to You, [Lord,] and You do not answer me; I stand up, but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me.",
  "21": "You have become harsh and cruel to me; with the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me.",
  "22": "You lift me up on the wind; You cause me to ride upon it, and You toss me about in the tempest.",
  "23": "For I know that You will bring me to death and to the house [of meeting] appointed for all the living.",
  "24": "However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his calamity will he not therefore cry for help?",
  "25": "Did not I weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the poor and needy?",
  "26": "But when I looked for good, then evil came to me; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.",
  "27": "My heart is troubled and does not rest; days of affliction come to meet me.",
  "28": "I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the congregation and cry for help.",
  "29": "I am a brother to jackals [which howl], and a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally].",
  "30": "My skin falls from me in blackened flakes, and my bones are burned with heat.",
  "31": "Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep."
