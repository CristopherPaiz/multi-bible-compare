  "1": "AFTER THIS, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday).",
  "2": "And Job said,",
  "3": "Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which announced, There is a man-child conceived.",
  "4": "Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it, nor light shine upon it.",
  "5": "Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born).",
  "6": "As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.",
  "7": "Yes, let that night be solitary and barren; let no joyful voice come into it.",
  "8": "Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan.",
  "9": "Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let [the morning] look in vain for the light, nor let it behold the day's dawning,",
  "10": "Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow and trouble from my eyes.",
  "11": "Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me?",
  "12": "Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?",
  "13": "For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest [in death]",
  "14": "With kings and counselors of the earth, who built up [now] desolate ruins for themselves,",
  "15": "Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.",
  "16": "Or [why] was I not a miscarriage, hidden and put away, as infants who never saw light?",
  "17": "There [in death] the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.",
  "18": "There the [captive] prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice.",
  "19": "The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. [Jer. 20:14-18.]",
  "20": "Why is light [of life] given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,",
  "21": "Who long and wait for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,",
  "22": "Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave?",
  "23": "[Why is the light of day given] to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in?",
  "24": "For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings are poured out like water.",
  "25": "For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me, and that of which I am afraid befalls me.",
  "26": "I was not or am not at ease, nor had I or have I rest, nor was I or am I quiet, yet trouble came and still comes [upon me]."
