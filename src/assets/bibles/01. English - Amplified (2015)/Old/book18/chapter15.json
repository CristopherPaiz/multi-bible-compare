  "1": "THEN ELIPHAZ the Temanite answered [Job],",
  "2": "Should a wise man utter such windy knowledge [as we have just heard] and fill himself with the east wind [of withering, parching, and violent accusations]?",
  "3": "Should he reason with unprofitable talk? Or with speeches with which he can do no good?",
  "4": "Indeed, you are doing away with [reverential] fear, and you are hindering and diminishing meditation and devotion before God.",
  "5": "For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.",
  "6": "Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; yes, your own lips testify against you.",
  "7": "Are you the first man that was born [the original wise man]? Or were you created before the hills?",
  "8": "Were you present to hear the secret counsel of God? And do you limit [the possession of] wisdom to yourself?",
  "9": "What do you know that we know not? What do you understand that is not equally clear to us?",
  "10": "Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged, older than your father by far.",
  "11": "Are God's consolations [as we have interpreted them to you] too trivial for you? Is there any secret thing (any bosom sin) which you have not given up? [Or] were we too gentle [in our first speech] toward you to be effective?",
  "12": "Why does your heart carry you away [why allow yourself to be controlled by feeling]? And why do your eyes flash [in anger or contempt],",
  "13": "That you turn your spirit against God and let [such] words [as you have spoken] go out of your mouth?",
  "14": "What is man, that he could be pure and clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he could be right and just?",
  "15": "Behold, [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight--",
  "16": "How much less that which is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water?",
  "17": "I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will relate,",
  "18": "What wise men have not hid but have freely communicated; it was told to them by their fathers,",
  "19": "Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger intruded or passed among them [corrupting the truth].",
  "20": "The wicked man suffers with [self-inflicted] torment all his days, through all the years that are numbered and laid up for him, the oppressor.",
  "21": "A [dreadful] sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him [the dwellings of robbers are not at peace].",
  "22": "He believes that he will not return out of darkness, and [because of his guilt] he is waited for by the sword [of God's vengeance].",
  "23": "He wanders abroad for food, saying, Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness and destruction is already close upon him.",
  "24": "Distress and anguish terrify him; [he knows] they shall prevail against him, like a king ready for battle.",
  "25": "Because he has stretched out his hand against God and bids defiance and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,",
  "26": "Running stubbornly against Him with a thickly ornamented shield;",
  "27": "Because he has covered his face with his fat, adding layers of fat on his loins [giving himself up to animal pleasures],",
  "28": "And has lived in desolate [God-forsaken] cities and in houses which no man should inhabit, which were destined to become heaps [of ruins];",
  "29": "He shall not be rich, neither shall his wealth last, neither shall his produce bend to the earth nor his possessions be extended on the earth.",
  "30": "He shall not depart out of darkness [and escape from calamity; the wrath of God] shall consume him as flame consumes a dry tree, and by the blast of His mouth he shall be swept away.",
  "31": "Let him not deceive himself and trust in vanity (emptiness, falseness, and futility), for these shall be his recompense [for such living].",
  "32": "It shall be accomplished and paid in full while he still lives, and his branch shall not be green [but shall wither away].",
  "33": "He shall fail to bring his grapes to maturity [leaving them to wither unnourished] on the vine and shall cast off blossoms [and fail to bring forth fruit] like the olive tree.",
  "34": "For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice).",
  "35": "They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, and their inmost soul hatches deceit."
