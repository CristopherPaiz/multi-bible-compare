  "1": "SO THESE three men ceased to answer Job, because he was [rigidly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) in his own eyes. [But there was a fifth man there also.]",
  "2": "Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God [even made himself out to be better than God].",
  "3": "Also against [Job's] three friends was [Elihu's] anger kindled, because they had found no answer [were unable to show his real error], and yet they had declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions].",
  "4": "Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.",
  "5": "But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.",
  "6": "Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said, I am young, and you are aged; for that reason I was timid and restrained and dared not declare my opinion to you.",
  "7": "I said, Age should speak, and a multitude of years should teach wisdom [so let it be heard].",
  "8": "But there is [a vital force] a spirit [of intelligence] in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives men understanding. [Prov. 2:6.]",
  "9": "It is not the great [necessarily] who are wise, nor [always] the aged who understand justice.",
  "10": "So I say, Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion [about Job's situation] and my knowledge.",
  "11": "You see, I waited for your words, I listened to your wise reasons, while you searched out what to say.",
  "12": "Yes, I paid attention to what you said, and behold, not one of you convinced Job or made [satisfactory] replies to his words [you could not refute him].",
  "13": "Beware lest you say, We have found wisdom; God thrusts [Job] down [justly], not man [God alone is dealing with him].",
  "14": "Now [Job] has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no cause for irritation], neither will I answer him with speeches like yours. [I speak for truth, not for revenge.]",
  "15": "[Job's friends] are amazed and embarrassed, they answer no more; they have not a thing to say [reports Elihu].",
  "16": "And shall I wait, because they say nothing but stand still and answer no more?",
  "17": "I also will answer my [God-assigned] part; I also will declare my opinion and my knowledge.",
  "18": "For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.",
  "19": "My breast is as wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.",
  "20": "I must speak, that I may get relief and be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.",
  "21": "I will not [I warn you] be influenced by respect for any man's person and show partiality, neither will I flatter any man.",
  "22": "For I know not how to flatter, [wasting my time in mere formalities, for then] my Maker would soon take me away."
