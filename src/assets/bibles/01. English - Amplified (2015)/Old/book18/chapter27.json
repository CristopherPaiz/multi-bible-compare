  "1": "JOB AGAIN took up his discourse and said,",
  "2": "As God lives, Who has taken away my right and denied me justice, and the Almighty, Who has vexed and embittered my life,",
  "3": "As long as my life is still whole within me, and the breath of God is [yet] in my nostrils,",
  "4": "My lips shall not speak untruth, nor shall my tongue utter deceit.",
  "5": "God forbid that I should justify you--saying you are right [in your accusations against me]; till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.",
  "6": "My uprightness and my right standing with God I hold fast and will not let them go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days and it shall not reproach me as long as I live.",
  "7": "Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.",
  "8": "For what is the hope of the godless and polluted, even though he has gained [in this world], when God cuts him off and takes away his life?",
  "9": "Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?",
  "10": "Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?",
  "11": "I will teach you regarding the hand and handiwork of God; that which is with the Almighty [God's actual treatment of the wicked man] will I not conceal.",
  "12": "Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain [cherishing foolish notions]?",
  "13": "This [which I am about to tell] is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage which oppressors shall receive from the Almighty:",
  "14": "If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring will not have sufficient bread.",
  "15": "Those who survive him, [the pestilence] will bury, and [their] widows will make no lamentation.",
  "16": "Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up clothing like clay,",
  "17": "He may prepare it, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.",
  "18": "He builds his house like a moth or a spider, like a booth which a watchman makes [to last for a season].",
  "19": "[The wicked] will lie down rich, but does it not again; he opens his eyes, and [his wealth] is gone.",
  "20": "Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly loosened] flood; a windstorm steals him away in the night.",
  "21": "The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.",
  "22": "For [God and the storm] hurl at him without pity and unsparingly [their thunderbolts of wrath]; he flees in haste before His power.",
  "23": "[God causes] men to clap their hands at him [in malignant joy] and hiss him out of his place."
