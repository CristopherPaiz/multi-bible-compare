  "1": "CAN YOU draw out the leviathan (the crocodile) with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?",
  "2": "Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook or a spike?",
  "3": "Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]? Will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]?",
  "4": "Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?",
  "5": "Will you play with [the crocodile] as with a bird? Or will you put him on a leash for your maidens?",
  "6": "Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?",
  "7": "Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears?",
  "8": "Lay your hand upon him! Remember your battle with him; you will not do [such an ill-advised thing] again!",
  "9": "Behold, the hope of [his assailant] is disappointed; one is cast down even at the sight of him!",
  "10": "No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up [the crocodile]; who then is he who can stand before Me [the beast's Creator, or dares to contend with Me]?",
  "11": "Who has first given to Me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heavens is Mine. [Therefore, who can have a claim against God, God Who made the unmastered crocodile?] [Rom. 11:35.]",
  "12": "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.",
  "13": "Who can strip off [the crocodile's] outer garment? [Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?] Who shall come within his jaws?",
  "14": "Who can open the doors of his [lipless] mouth? His [extended jaws and bare] teeth are terrible round about.",
  "15": "His scales are [the crocodile's] pride, [for his back is made of rows of shields] shut up together [as with] a tight seal;",
  "16": "One is so near to another that no air can come between them.",
  "17": "They are joined one to another; they stick together so that they cannot be separated.",
  "18": "His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn.",
  "19": "Out of his mouth go burning torches, [and] sparks of fire leap out.",
  "20": "Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as out of a seething pot over a fire of rushes.",
  "21": "His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth.",
  "22": "In [the crocodile's] neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.",
  "23": "The folds of his flesh cleave together; they are firm upon him, and they cannot shake [when he moves].",
  "24": "His heart is as firm as a stone, indeed, as solid as a nether millstone.",
  "25": "When [the crocodile] raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of terror and the crashing they are beside themselves.",
  "26": "Even if one strikes at him with the sword, it cannot get any hold, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.",
  "27": "He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.",
  "28": "The arrow cannot make [the crocodile] flee; slingstones are treated by him as stubble.",
  "29": "Clubs [also] are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rushing and the rattling of the javelin.",
  "30": "His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; he spreads [grooves like] a threshing sledge upon the mire.",
  "31": "He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment.",
  "32": "[His swift darting] makes a shining track behind him; one would think the deep to be hoary [with foam].",
  "33": "Upon earth there is not [the crocodile's] equal, a creature made without fear and he behaves fearlessly.",
  "34": "He looks all mighty [beasts of prey] in the face [without terror]; he is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now, Job, who are you who dares not arouse the unmastered crocodile, yet who dares resist Me, the beast's Creator, to My face? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore, who can have a claim against God?]"
