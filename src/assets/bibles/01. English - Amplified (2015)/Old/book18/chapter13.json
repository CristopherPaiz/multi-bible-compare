  "1": "[JOB CONTINUED:] Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.",
  "2": "What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.",
  "3": "Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue and reason my case with God [that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him].",
  "4": "But you are forgers of lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; you are all physicians of no value and have no remedy to offer.",
  "5": "Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom and you might pass for wise men.",
  "6": "Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.",
  "7": "Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him?",
  "8": "Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]? Will you act as special pleaders for God?",
  "9": "Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]? Or as one deceives and mocks a man, do you deceive and mock Him?",
  "10": "He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality.",
  "11": "Shall not His majesty make you afraid, and should not your awe for Him restrain you?",
  "12": "Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes [valueless]; your defenses are defenses of clay [and will crumble].",
  "13": "Hold your peace! Let me alone, so I may speak; and let come on me what may.",
  "14": "Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands [incurring the danger of God's wrath]?",
  "15": "[I do it because, though He slay me, yet will I wait for and trust Him and] behold, He will slay me; I have no hope--nevertheless, I will maintain and argue my ways before Him and even to His face.",
  "16": "This will be my salvation, that a polluted and godless man shall not come before Him.",
  "17": "Listen diligently to my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears.",
  "18": "Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified and vindicated.",
  "19": "Who is he who will argue against and refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire.",
  "20": "Only [O Lord] grant two conditions to me, and then will I not hide myself from You:",
  "21": "Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my [reverent] dread of You terrify me.",
  "22": "Then [Lord] call and I will answer, or let me speak, and You answer me.",
  "23": "How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize and know my transgression and my sin. [Rom. 8:1.]",
  "24": "Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] and alienate me as if I were Your enemy?",
  "25": "Will You harass and frighten a [poor, helpless] leaf driven to and fro, and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble?",
  "26": "For You write bitter things against me [in Your bill of indictment] and make me inherit and be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth.",
  "27": "You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle and limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep].",
