  "1": "MAN WHO is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.",
  "2": "He comes forth like a flower and withers; he flees also like a shadow and continues not.",
  "3": "And [Lord] do You open Your eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with You?",
  "4": "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one! [Isa. 1:18; I John 1:7.]",
  "5": "Since a man's days are already determined, and the number of his months is wholly in Your control, and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time--",
  "6": "[O God] turn from him [and cease to watch him so pitilessly]; let him rest until he has accomplished as does a hireling the appointed time for his day.",
  "7": "For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that the tender shoots of it will not cease. [But there is no such hope for man.]",
  "8": "Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground,",
  "9": "Yet through the scent [and breathing] of water [the stump of the tree] will bud and bring forth boughs like a young plant.",
  "10": "But [the brave, strong] man must die and lie prostrate; yes, man breathes his last, and where is he?",
  "11": "As waters evaporate from the lake, and the river drains and dries up,",
  "12": "So man lies down and does not rise [to his former state]. Till the heavens are no more, men will not awake nor be raised [physically] out of their sleep.",
  "13": "Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the unseen state), that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, that You would set a definite time and then remember me earnestly [and imprint me on your heart]!",
  "14": "If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare and service I will wait, till my change and release shall come. [John 5:25; 6:40; I Thess. 4:16.]",
  "15": "[Then] You would call and I would answer You; You would yearn for [me] the work of Your hands.",
  "16": "But now You number each of my steps and take note of my every sin.",
  "17": "My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You glue up my iniquity [to preserve it in full for the day of reckoning].",
  "18": "But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles to nothing, and as the rock is removed out of its place,",
  "19": "As waters wear away the stones and as floods wash away the soil of the earth, so You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man.",
  "20": "You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his appearance [in death] and send him away [from the presence of the living].",
  "21": "His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; they are brought low, and he perceives it not.",
  "22": "But his body [lamenting its decay in the grave] shall grieve over him, and his soul shall mourn [over the body of clay which it once enlivened]."
