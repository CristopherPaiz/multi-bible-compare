  "1": "BE THAT as it may, Job, I beg of you to hear what I have to say and give heed to all my words.",
  "2": "Behold, here I am with open mouth; here is my tongue talking.",
  "3": "My words shall express the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall speak what they know with utter sincerity.",
  "4": "[It is] the Spirit of God that made me [which has stirred me up], and the breath of the Almighty that gives me life [which inspires me].",
  "5": "Answer me now, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.",
  "6": "Behold, I am toward God and before Him even as you are; I also am formed out of the clay [though I speak with abnormal wisdom because of a divine illumination].",
  "7": "See my terror [for I am only a fellow mortal, not God]; I shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon you.",
  "8": "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying,",
  "9": "I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.",
  "10": "But behold, God finds occasions against me and causes of alienation and indifference; He counts me as His enemy.",
  "11": "He puts my feet in the stocks; He [untrustingly] watches all my paths [you say].",
  "12": "I reply to you, Behold, in this you are not just; God is superior to man.",
  "13": "Why do you contend against Him? For He does not give account of any of His actions. [Sufficient for us it should be to know that it is He Who does them.]",
  "14": "For God [does reveal His will; He] speaks not only once, but more than once, even though men do not regard it [including you, Job].",
  "15": "[One may hear God's voice] in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men while slumbering upon the bed,",
  "16": "Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction [terrifying them with warnings],",
  "17": "That He may withdraw man from his purpose and cut off pride from him [disgusting him with his own disappointing self-sufficiency].",
  "18": "He holds him back from the pit [of destruction], and his life from perishing by the sword [of God's destructive judgments].",
  "19": "[God's voice may be heard by man when] he is chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones or while all his bones are firmly set,",
  "20": "So that his desire makes him loathe food, and even dainty dishes [nauseate him].",
  "21": "His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.",
  "22": "Yes, his soul draws near to corruption, and his life to the inflicters of death (the destroyers).",
  "23": "[God's voice may be heard] if there is for the hearer a messenger or an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him [how to be upright and in right standing with God],",
  "24": "Then [God] is gracious to him and says, Deliver him from going down into the pit [of destruction]; I have found a ransom (a price of redemption, an atonement)!",
  "25": "[Then the man's] flesh shall be restored; it becomes fresher and more tender than a child's; he returns to the days of his youth.",
  "26": "He prays to God, and He is favorable to him, so that he sees His face with joy; for [God] restores to him his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God--with its joys).",
  "27": "He looks upon other men or sings out to them, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me, or He did not requite me [according to my iniquity]!",
  "28": "[God] has redeemed my life from going down to the pit [of destruction], and my life shall see the light!",
  "29": "[Elihu comments] Behold, God does all these things twice, yes, three times, with a man,",
  "30": "To bring back his life from the pit [of destruction], that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.",
  "31": "Give heed, O Job, listen to me; hold your peace, and I will speak.",
  "32": "If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.",
  "33": "If [you do] not [have anything to say], listen to me; hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
