  "1": "THEN JOB answered:",
  "2": "How long will you vex and torment me and break me in pieces with words?",
  "3": "These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange [harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me].",
  "4": "And if it were true that I have erred, my error would remain with me [I would be conscious of it].",
  "5": "If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach and humiliation,",
  "6": "Know that God has overthrown and put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me.",
  "7": "Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help, but there is no justice.",
  "8": "He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness upon my paths.",
  "9": "He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head.",
  "10": "He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree.",
  "11": "He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His adversaries.",
  "12": "His troops come together and cast up their way and siege works against me and encamp round about my tent.",
  "13": "He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.",
  "14": "My kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.",
  "15": "Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.",
  "16": "I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer, though I beseech him with words.",
  "17": "I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother.",
  "18": "Even young children despise me; when I get up, they speak against me.",
  "19": "All the men of my council and my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me.",
  "20": "My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin or gums of my teeth.",
  "21": "Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!",
  "22": "Why do you, as if you were God, pursue and persecute me? [Acting like wild beasts] why are you not satisfied with my flesh?",
  "23": "Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book [carved on a tablet of stone]!",
  "24": "That with an iron pen and [molten] lead they were graven in the rock forever!",
  "25": "For I know that my Redeemer and Vindicator lives, and at last He [the Last One] will stand upon the earth. [Isa. 44:6; 48:12.]",
  "26": "And after my skin, even this body, has been destroyed, then from my flesh or without it I shall see God,",
  "27": "Whom I, even I, shall see for myself and on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him, and not as a stranger! My heart pines away and is consumed within me.",
  "28": "If you say, How we will pursue him! [and continue to persecute me with the claim] that the root [cause] of all these [afflictions] is found in me,",
  "29": "Then beware and be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance], for wrathful are the punishments of that sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
