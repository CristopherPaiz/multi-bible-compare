  "1": "THEN ZOPHAR the Naamathite replied,",
  "2": "Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk [and making such great professions] be pronounced free from guilt or blame?",
  "3": "Should your boastings and babble make men keep silent? And when you mock and scoff, shall no man make you ashamed?",
  "4": "For you have said, My doctrine [that God afflicts the righteous knowingly] is pure, and I am clean in [God's] eyes. [Job 10:7.]",
  "5": "But oh, that God would speak, and open His lips against you,",
  "6": "And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt and iniquity [deserve].",
  "7": "Can you find out the deep things of God, or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty [explore His depths, ascend to His heights, extend to His breadths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]?",
  "8": "His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know?",
  "9": "Longer in measure [and scope] is it than the earth, and broader than the sea.",
  "10": "If [God] sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment, who can hinder Him? [If He is against a man, who shall call Him to account for it?]",
  "11": "For He recognizes and knows hollow, wicked, and useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it?",
  "12": "But a stupid man will get wisdom [only] when a wild donkey's colt is born a man [as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride].",
  "13": "If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to [God],",
  "14": "If you put sin out of your hand and far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents;",
  "15": "Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain [of sin, and unashamed]; yes, you shall be steadfast and secure; you shall not fear.",
  "16": "For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away.",
  "17": "And [your] life shall be clearer than the noonday and rise above it; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.",
  "18": "And you shall be secure and feel confident because there is hope; yes, you shall search about you, and you shall take your rest in safety.",
  "19": "You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall sue for your favor.",
  "20": "But the eyes of the wicked shall look [for relief] in vain, and they shall not escape [the justice of God]; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost."
