  "1": "MOREOVER, THE Lord said to Job,",
  "2": "Shall he who would find fault with the Almighty contend with Him? He who disputes with God, let him answer it.",
  "3": "Then Job replied to the Lord:",
  "4": "Behold, I am of small account and vile! What shall I answer You? I lay my hand upon my mouth. [Ezra 9:6; Ps. 51:4.]",
  "5": "I have spoken once, but I will not reply again--indeed, twice [have I answered], but I will proceed no further.",
  "6": "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, saying,",
  "7": "Gird up your loins now like a man; I will demand of you, and you answer Me.",
  "8": "Will you also annul (set aside and render void) My judgment? Will you condemn Me [your God], that you may [appear] righteous and justified?",
  "9": "Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?",
  "10": "[Since you question the manner of the Almighty's rule] deck yourself now with the excellency and dignity [of the Supreme Ruler, and yourself undertake the government of the world if you are so wise], and array yourself with honor and majesty.",
  "11": "Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him;",
  "12": "Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low, and tread down the wicked where they stand [if you are so able, Job].",
  "13": "[Bury and] hide them all in the dust together; [and] shut them up [in the prison house of death].",
  "14": "[If you can do all this, Job, proving yourself of divine might] then will I [God] praise you also [and acknowledge that] your own right hand can save you.",
  "15": "Behold now the behemoth (the hippopotamus), which I created as I did you; he eats grass like an ox.",
  "16": "See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in the sinews of his belly.",
  "17": "He moves his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are twisted together [like a rope].",
  "18": "His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs [or ribs] are like bars of iron.",
  "19": "[The hippopotamus] is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God [in animal life]; [only] He Who made him provides him with his [swordlike tusks, or only God Who made him can bring near His sword to master him].",
  "20": "Surely the mountains bring him food, where all the wild animals play.",
  "21": "He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reeds in the marsh.",
  "22": "The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook compass him about.",
  "23": "Behold, if a river is violent and overflows, he does not tremble; he is confident, though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth.",
  "24": "Can any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
