  "1": "AND JOB again took up his discussion and said,",
  "2": "Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me, [Eccl. 7:10.]",
  "3": "When His lamp shone above and upon my head and by His light I walked through darkness;",
  "4": "As I was in the [prime] ripeness of my days, when the friendship and counsel of God were over my tent,",
  "5": "When the Almighty was yet with me and my children were about me,",
  "6": "When my steps [through rich pasturage] were washed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!",
  "7": "When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the street [the broad place for the council at the city's gate],",
  "8": "The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged rose up and stood;",
  "9": "The princes refrained from talking and laid their hands on their mouths;",
  "10": "The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouths.",
  "11": "For when the ear heard, it called me happy and blessed me; and when the eye saw, it testified for me [approvingly],",
  "12": "Because I delivered the poor who cried, the fatherless and him who had none to help him.",
  "13": "The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.",
  "14": "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me or clothed itself with me; my justice was like a robe and a turban or a diadem or a crown!",
  "15": "I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.",
  "16": "I was a father to the poor and needy; the cause of him I did not know I searched out.",
  "17": "And I broke the jaws or the big teeth of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth.",
  "18": "Then I said, I shall die in or beside my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.",
  "19": "My root is spread out and open to the waters, and the dew lies all night upon my branch.",
  "20": "My glory and honor are fresh in me [being constantly renewed], and my bow gains [ever] new strength in my hand.",
  "21": "Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.",
  "22": "After I spoke, they did not speak again, and my speech dropped upon them [like a refreshing shower].",
  "23": "And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the spring rain.",
  "24": "I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and their depression did not cast down the light of my countenance.",
  "25": "I chose their way [for them] and sat as [their] chief, and dwelt like a king among his soldiers, like one who comforts mourners."
