  "1": "DO YOU know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth [their young]? [Or] do you observe when the hinds are giving birth? [Do you attend to all this, Job?]",
  "2": "Can you number the months that they carry their offspring? Or do you know the time when they are delivered,",
  "3": "When they bow themselves, bring forth their young ones, [and] cast out their pains?",
  "4": "Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth and return not to them.",
  "5": "Who has sent out the wild donkey, giving him his freedom? Or who has loosed the bands of the swift donkey [by which his tame brother is bound--he, the shy, the swift-footed, and the untamable],",
  "6": "Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place?",
  "7": "He scorns the tumult of the city and hears not the shoutings of the taskmaster.",
  "8": "The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.",
  "9": "Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or remain beside your manger?",
  "10": "Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to the plow in the furrow? Or will he harrow the furrows for you?",
  "11": "Will you trust him because his strength is great, or to him will you leave your labor?",
  "12": "Will you depend upon him to bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor? [Who, Job, was the author of this strange variance in the disposition of animals so alike in appearance? Was it you?]",
  "13": "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love?",
  "14": "The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust,",
  "15": "Forgetting that a foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them.",
  "16": "She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labor is in vain because she has no sense of danger [for her unborn brood],",
  "17": "For God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has He imparted to her understanding.",
  "18": "Yet when she lifts herself up in flight, [so swift is she that] she can laugh to scorn the horse and his rider.",
  "19": "Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering and a shaking mane?",
  "20": "Was it you [Job] who made him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his [snorting] nostrils is terrible.",
  "21": "He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men].",
  "22": "He mocks at fear and is not dismayed or terrified; neither does he turn back [in battle] from the sword.",
  "23": "The quiver rattles upon him, as do the glittering spear and the lance [of his rider].",
  "24": "[He seems in running to] devour the ground with fierceness and rage; neither can he stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet.",
  "25": "As often as the trumpet sounds he says, Ha, ha! And he smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.",
  "26": "Is it by your wisdom [Job] that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south [as winter approaches]?",
  "27": "Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on [a] high [inaccessible place]?",
  "28": "On the cliff he dwells and remains securely, upon the point of the rock and the stronghold.",
  "29": "From there he spies out the prey; and his eyes see it afar off.",
  "30": "His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he."
