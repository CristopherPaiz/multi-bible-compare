  "1": "THEN JOB answered,",
  "2": "No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world], and wisdom will die with you!",
  "3": "But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these [of God's wisdom and might]?",
  "4": "I am become one who is a laughingstock to his friend; I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him--a just, upright (blameless) man--laughed to scorn!",
  "5": "In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune--but it is ready for those whose feet slip.",
  "6": "The dwellings of robbers prosper; those who provoke God are [apparently] secure; God supplies them abundantly [who have no god but their own hands and power].",
  "7": "For ask now the animals, and they will teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you;",
  "8": "Or speak to the earth [with its other forms of life], and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare [this truth] to you.",
  "9": "Who [is so blind as] not to recognize in all these [that good and evil are promiscuously scattered throughout nature and human life] that it is God's hand which does it [and God's way]?",
  "10": "In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind.",
  "11": "Is it not the task of the ear to discriminate between [wise and unwise] words, just as the mouth distinguishes [between desirable and undesirable] food?",
  "12": "With the aged [you say] is wisdom, and with length of days comes understanding.",
  "13": "But [only] with [God] are [perfect] wisdom and might; He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding.",
  "14": "Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be built again; He shuts a man in, and none can open.",
  "15": "He withholds the waters, and the land dries up; again, He sends forth [rains], and they overwhelm the land or transform it.",
  "16": "With Him are might and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His [and in His power].",
  "17": "He leads [great and scheming] counselors away stripped and barefoot and makes the judges fools [in human estimation, by overthrowing their plans].",
  "18": "He looses the fetters [ordered] by kings and has [the] waistcloth [of a slave] bound about their [own] loins.",
  "19": "He leads away priests as spoil, and men firmly seated He overturns.",
  "20": "He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment and discretion of the aged.",
  "21": "He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them, bringing low the pride of the learned].",
  "22": "He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings into light black gloom and the shadow of death.",
  "23": "He makes nations great, and He destroys them; He enlarges nations [and then straitens and shrinks them again], and leads them [away captive].",
  "24": "He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the land and of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path.",
  "25": "They grope in the dark without light, and He makes them to stagger and wander like a drunken man."
