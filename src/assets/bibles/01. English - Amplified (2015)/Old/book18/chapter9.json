  "1": "THEN JOB answered and said,",
  "2": "Yes, I know it is true. But how can mortal man be right before God?",
  "3": "If one should want to contend with Him, he cannot answer one [of His questions] in a thousand.",
  "4": "[God] is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has [ever] hardened himself against Him and prospered or even been safe?",
  "5": "[God] Who removes the mountains, and they know it not when He overturns them in His anger;",
  "6": "Who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble;",
  "7": "Who commands the sun, and it rises not; Who seals up the stars [from view];",
  "8": "Who alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the waves and high places of the sea;",
  "9": "Who made [the constellations] the Bear, Orion, and the [loose cluster] Pleiades, and the [vast starry] spaces of the south;",
  "10": "Who does great things past finding out, yes, marvelous things without number.",
  "11": "Behold, He goes by me, and I see Him not; He passes on also, but I perceive Him not.",
  "12": "Behold, He snatches away; who can hinder or turn Him back? Who will say to Him, What are You doing?",
  "13": "God will not withdraw His anger; the [proud] helpers of Rahab [arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him.",
  "14": "How much less shall I answer Him, choosing out my words to reason with Him",
  "15": "Whom, though I were righteous (upright and innocent) yet I could not answer? I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent and Judge [for my right].",
  "16": "If I called and He answered me, yet would I not believe that He listened to my voice.",
  "17": "For He overwhelms and breaks me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause.",
  "18": "He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.",
  "19": "If I speak of strength, behold, He is mighty! And if of justice, Who, says He, will summon Me?",
  "20": "Though I am innocent and in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, He would prove me perverse.",
  "21": "Though I am blameless, I regard not myself; I despise my life.",
  "22": "It is all one; therefore I say, God [does not discriminate, but] destroys the blameless and the wicked.",
  "23": "When [His] scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the calamity and trial of the innocent.",
  "24": "The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blinded to justice]. If it is not [God], who then is it [responsible for all this inequality]?",
  "25": "Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.",
  "26": "They are passed away like the swift rowboats made of reeds, or like the eagle that swoops down on the prey.",
  "27": "If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer and brighten up,",
  "28": "I become afraid of all my pains and sorrows [yet to come], for I know You will not pronounce me innocent [by removing them].",
  "29": "I shall be held guilty and be condemned; why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]?",
  "30": "If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,",
  "31": "Yet You will plunge me into the ditch, and my own clothes will abhor me [and refuse to cover so foul a body].",
  "32": "For [God] is not a [mere] man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in court.",
  "33": "There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand upon us both, [would that there were!] [I Tim. 2:5.]",
  "34": "That He might take His rod away from [threatening] me, and that the fear of Him might not terrify me.",
  "35": "[Then] would I speak and not fear Him, but I am not so in myself [to make me afraid, were only a fair trial given me]."
