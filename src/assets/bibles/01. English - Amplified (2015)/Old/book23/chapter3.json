  "8": "For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of His glory and defy His glorious presence.",
  "9": "Their respecting of persons and showing of partiality witnesses against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil [as a reward upon themselves].",

  "15": "What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor? says the Lord God of hosts.",
  "16": "Moreover, the Lord said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks and with undisciplined (flirtatious and alluring) eyes, tripping along with mincing and affected gait, and making a tinkling noise with [the anklets on] their feet,",
  "17": "Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion [making them bald], and the Lord will cause them to be [taken as captives and to suffer the indignity of being] stripped naked.",
  "18": "In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their tinkling anklets, the caps of network, the crescent head ornaments,",

  "25": "Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty men in battle.",
  "26": "And [Jerusalem's] gates shall lament and mourn [as those who wail for the dead]; and she, being ruined and desolate, shall sit upon the ground."
