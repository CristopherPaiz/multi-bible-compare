  "1": "BEHOLD, A King will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.",
  "2": "And each one of them shall be like a hiding place from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land [to those who turn to them].",
  "3": "Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed or dimmed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.",
  "4": "And the mind of the rash will understand knowledge and have good judgment, and the tongue of the stammerers will speak readily and plainly.",
  "5": "The fool (the unbeliever and the ungodly) will no more be called noble, nor the crafty and greedy [for gain] said to be bountiful and princely.",
  "6": "For the fool speaks folly and his mind plans iniquity: practicing profane ungodliness and speaking error concerning the Lord, leaving the craving of the hungry unsatisfied and causing the drink of the thirsty to fail.",
  "7": "The instruments and methods of the fraudulent and greedy [for gain] are evil; he devises wicked devices to ruin the poor and the lowly with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is just and right.",
  "8": "But the noble, openhearted, and liberal man devises noble things; and he stands for what is noble, openhearted, and generous.",
  "9": "Rise up, you women who are at ease! Hear my [Isaiah's] voice, you confident and careless daughters! Listen to what I am saying!",
  "10": "In little more than a year you will be shaken with anxiety, you careless and complacent women; for the vintage will fail, and the ingathering will not come.",
  "11": "Tremble, you women who are at ease! Shudder with fear, you complacent ones! Strip yourselves bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins [in grief]!",
  "12": "They shall beat upon their breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,",
  "13": "For the land of my people growing over with thorns and briers--yes, for all the houses of joy in the joyous city.",
  "14": "For the palace shall be forsaken, the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watchtower shall become dens [for wild animals] endlessly, a joy for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks,",
  "15": "Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is valued as a forest. [Ps. 104:30; Ezek. 36:26, 27; 39:29; Zech. 12:10.]",
  "16": "Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation) will abide in the fruitful field.",
  "17": "And the effect of righteousness will be peace [internal and external], and the result of righteousness will be quietness and confident trust forever.",
  "18": "My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.",
  "19": "But it [the wrath of the Lord] shall hail, coming down overpoweringly on the forest [the army of the Assyrians], and the capital city shall be utterly humbled and laid prostrate.",
  "20": "Happy and fortunate are you who cast your seed upon all waters [when the river overflows its banks; for the seed will sink into the mud and when the waters subside, the plant will spring up; you will find it after many days and reap an abundant harvest], you who safely send forth the ox and the donkey [to range freely]."
