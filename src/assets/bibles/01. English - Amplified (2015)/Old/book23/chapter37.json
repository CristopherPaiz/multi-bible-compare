  "12": "Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my predecessors have destroyed, as Gozan, Haran [of Mesopotamia], Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?",

  "17": "Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock, reproach, insult, and defy the living God.",
  "18": "It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands",
  "19": "And have cast the gods of those peoples into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.",

  "22": "This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him: The Virgin Daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the Daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.",
  "23": "Whom have you mocked and reviled [insulted and blasphemed]? And against Whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!",

  "28": "But I [the Lord] know your sitting down and your going out and your coming in and your raging against Me.",
  "29": "Because your raging against Me and your arrogance and careless ease have come to My ears, therefore will I put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way you came.",
  "30": "And [now, Hezekiah, says the Lord] this shall be the sign [of these things] to you: you shall eat this year what grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from the same. And in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.",
  "31": "And the remnant that has survived of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.",
  "32": "For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and a band that survives out of Mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.",

  "34": "By the way that he came, by the same way he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the Lord.",
  "35": "For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.",
