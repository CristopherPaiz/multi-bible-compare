  "1": "OH, THAT You would rend the heavens and that You would come down, that the mountains might quake and flow down at Your presence--",

  "3": "When You did terrible things which we did not expect, You came down; the mountains quaked at Your presence.",
  "4": "For from of old no one has heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who works and shows Himself active on behalf of him who [earnestly] waits for Him.",
  "5": "You meet and spare him who joyfully works righteousness (uprightness and justice), [earnestly] remembering You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned; we have long continued in our sins [prolonging Your anger]. And shall we be saved?",
  "6": "For we have all become like one who is unclean [ceremonially, like a leper], and all our righteousness (our best deeds of rightness and justice) is like filthy rags or a polluted garment; we all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away [far from God's favor, hurrying us toward destruction]. [Lev. 13:45, 46.]",
  "7": "And no one calls on Your name and awakens and bestirs himself to take and keep hold of You; for You have hidden Your face from us and have delivered us into the [consuming] power of our iniquities. [Rom. 1:21-24.]",
  "8": "Yet, O Lord, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You our Potter, and we all are the work of Your hand.",
  "9": "Do not be exceedingly angry, O Lord, or [seriously] remember iniquity forever. Behold, consider, we beseech You, we are all Your people.",
  "10": "Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.",
  "11": "Our holy and our beautiful house, [the temple] where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant and desirable places are in ruins.",
  "12": "Considering these [calamities], will You restrain Yourself, O Lord [and not come to our aid]? Will You keep silent and not command our deliverance but humble and afflict us exceedingly?"
