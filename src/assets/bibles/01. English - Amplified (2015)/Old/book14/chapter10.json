  "6": "King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he was alive, saying, What counsel do you give me in reply to the people?",

Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David [tribe of Judah], see to your own house [under your tyrant King Rehoboam]! So all Israel went to their homes.",
  "17": "But as for the Israelites who dwelt in Judah's cities, Rehoboam ruled over them.",
  "18": "Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him and he died. But King Rehoboam hastened to get up to his royal chariot to flee to Jerusalem.",
  "19": "And Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day."
