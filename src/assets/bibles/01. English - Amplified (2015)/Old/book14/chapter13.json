  "1": "IN THE eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.",
  "2": "He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam of Israel.",
  "3": "And Abijah prepared for battle with an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with 800,000 chosen men, mighty men of valor.",
  "4": "And Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!",
  "5": "Ought you not to know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingship over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?",
  "6": "Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord [the king].",
  "7": "And there gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young [as king], irresolute, and inexperienced and did not withstand them with firmness and strength.",
  "8": "And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord which is in the hands of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and you have with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made for you for gods.",
  "9": "Have you not driven out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? So whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of idols that are not gods.",
  "10": "But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. We have priests ministering to the Lord who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.",
  "11": "They offer to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and incense of sweet spices; they set in order the showbread on the table of pure gold and attend to the golden lampstand, that its lamps may be lighted every evening. For we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but you have forsaken Him.",
  "12": "Behold, God Himself is with us at our head, and His priests with their battle trumpets to sound an alarm against you. O Israelites, fight not against the Lord, the God of your fathers, for you cannot prosper.",
  "13": "But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come around them from behind, so his troops were before Judah and the ambush behind.",
  "14": "When Judah looked, behold, the battle was before and behind; and they cried to the Lord, and the priests blew the trumpets.",
  "15": "Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as they shouted, God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.",
  "16": "And the Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.",
  "17": "And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter, so there fell of Israel 500,000 chosen men.",
  "18": "Thus the Israelites were brought low at that time, and the people of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the Lord, the God of their fathers.",
  "19": "And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took some cities from him, Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephraim (Ephron), with their towns.",
  "20": "Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah. And the Lord smote him and he died.",
  "21": "But Abijah became mighty. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.",
  "22": "And the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo."
