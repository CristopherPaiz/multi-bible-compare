  "8": "And Solomon said to God, You have shown great mercy and loving-kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.",
  "9": "Now, O Lord God, let Your promise to David my father be fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.",
  "10": "Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this Your people who are so great?",
  "11": "God replied to Solomon, Because this was in your heart and you have not asked for riches, possessions, honor, and glory, or the life of your foes, or even for long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may rule and judge My people over whom I have made you king,",
  "12": "Wisdom and knowledge are granted you. And I will give you riches, possessions, honor, and glory, such as none of the kings had before you, and none after you shall have their equal.",

  "17": "They imported from Egypt a chariot for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150; so they brought out horses for all the Hittite and Syrian kings as export agents."
