  "1": "NOW NABOTH the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, close beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria; and after these things,",
  "2": "Ahab said to Naboth, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near my house. I will give you a better vineyard for it or, if you prefer, I will give you its worth in money.",
  "3": "Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.",
  "4": "And Ahab [already depressed by the Lord's message to him] came into his house [more] resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would eat no food.",
  "5": "But Jezebel his wife came and said to him, Why is your spirit so troubled that you eat no food?",
  "6": "And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it. And he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.",
  "7": "Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you not govern Israel? Arise, eat food, and let your heart be happy. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.",
  "8": "So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent them to the elders and nobles who dwelt with Naboth in his city.",
  "9": "And in the letters she said, Proclaim a fast and set Naboth up high among the people.",
  "10": "And set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, You cursed and renounced God and the king. Then carry him out and stone him to death.",
  "11": "And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt there, did as Jezebel had directed in the letters sent them.",
  "12": "They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth on high among the people.",
  "13": "Two base fellows came in and sat opposite him and they charged Naboth before the people, saying, Naboth cursed and renounced God and the king. Then he was carried out of the city and stoned to death.",
  "14": "Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.",
  "15": "Then Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.",
  "16": "When Ahab heard that, he arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.",
  "17": "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",
  "18": "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel in Samaria. He is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to possess it.",
  "19": "Say to him, Thus says the Lord: Have you killed and also taken possession? Thus says the Lord: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.",
  "20": "And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.",
  "21": "See [says the Lord], I will bring evil on you and utterly sweep away and cut off from Ahab every male, bond and free,",
  "22": "And will make your household like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the household of Baasha son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger and made Israel to sin.",
  "23": "Also the Lord said of Jezebel: The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.",
  "24": "Any belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and any who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat. [I Kings 14:11; 16:4.]",
  "25": "For there was no one who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord as did Ahab, incited by his wife Jezebel.",
  "26": "He did very abominably in going after idols, as had the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the Israelites.",
  "27": "When Ahab heard those words of Elijah, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his flesh, fasted, lay in sackcloth, and went quietly.",
  "28": "And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",
  "29": "Do you see how Ahab humbles himself before Me? Because he humbles himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his lifetime, but in his son's day I will bring the evil upon his house."
