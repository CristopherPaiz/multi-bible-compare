  "1": "AND SOLOMON made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the City of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.",
  "2": "But the people sacrificed [to God] in the high places [as the heathen did to their idols], for there was no house yet built to the Name of the Lord.",
  "3": "Solomon loved the Lord, walking [at first] in the statutes and practices of David his father, only he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.",
  "4": "The king went to Gibeon [near Jerusalem, where stood the tabernacle and the bronze altar] to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. One thousand burnt offerings Solomon offered on that altar.",
  "5": "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God said, Ask what I shall give you.",
  "6": "Solomon said, You have shown to Your servant David my father great mercy and loving-kindness, according as he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart with You; and You have kept for him this great kindness and steadfast love, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.",
  "7": "Now, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king instead of David my father, and I am but a lad [in wisdom and experience]; I know not how to go out (begin) or come in (finish).",
  "8": "Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people who cannot be counted for multitude.",
  "9": "So give Your servant an understanding mind and a hearing heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge and rule this Your great people? [James 1:5.]",
  "10": "It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.",
  "11": "God said to him, Because you have asked this and have not asked for long life or for riches, nor for the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to recognize what is just and right,",
  "12": "Behold, I have done as you asked. I have given you a wise, discerning mind, so that no one before you was your equal, nor shall any arise after you equal to you.",
  "13": "I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings equal to you all your days.",
  "14": "And if you will go My way, keep My statutes and My commandments as your father David did, then I will lengthen your days.",
  "15": "Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. He came to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.",
  "16": "Then two women who had become mothers out of wedlock came and stood before the king.",
  "17": "And one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.",
  "18": "And the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered. And we were together; no stranger was with us, just we two in the house.",
  "19": "And this woman's child died in the night because she lay on him.",
  "20": "And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while your handmaid slept and laid him in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom.",
  "21": "And when I rose to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I had considered him in the morning, behold, it was not the son I had borne.",
  "22": "But the other woman said, No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son! And this one said, No! But the dead son is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.",
  "23": "The king said, One says, This is my son that is alive and yours is the dead one. The other woman says, No! But your son is the dead one and mine is the living one.",
  "24": "And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword to the king.",
  "25": "And the king said, Divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other.",
  "26": "Then the mother of the living child said to the king, for she yearned over her son, O my lord, give her the living baby, and by no means slay him. But the other said, Let him not be mine or yours, but divide him.",
  "27": "Then the king said, Give her [who pleads for his life] the living baby, and by no means slay him. She is the child's mother.",
  "28": "And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had made, and they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice."
