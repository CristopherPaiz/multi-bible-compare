  "1": "AS DAVID sat in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remains under tent curtains.",
  "2": "Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.",
  "3": "And that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,",
  "4": "Go and tell David My servant, Thus says the Lord: You shall not build Me a house to dwell in,",
  "5": "For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel from Egypt until this day; but I have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.",
  "6": "Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I say a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?",
  "7": "Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over My people Israel.",
  "8": "And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you, and I will make your name like the name of the great ones of the earth.",
  "9": "Also I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,",
  "10": "Since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore, I foretell to you that the Lord will build you a house (a blessed posterity).",
  "11": "And it shall come to pass that when your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.",
  "12": "He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. [I Chron. 28:7.]",
  "13": "I will be his father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy and steadfast love away from him, as I took it from him [King Saul] who was before you. [Heb. 1:5, 6.]",
  "14": "But I will settle him (Him) in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his (His) throne shall be established forevermore. [Isa. 9:7.]",
  "15": "According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.",
  "16": "And David the king went in and sat before the Lord and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house and family, that You have brought me up to this?",
  "17": "And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; for You have spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God!",
  "18": "What more can David say to You for thus honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant.",
  "19": "O Lord, for Your servant's sake and in accord with Your own heart, You have wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.",
  "20": "O Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God beside You, according to all that our ears have heard.",
  "21": "And what nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to Himself as a people, making Yourself a name by great and terrible things, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed out of Egypt?",
  "22": "You made Your people Israel Your own forever, and You, Lord, became their God.",
  "23": "Therefore now, Lord, let the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever, and do as You have said.",
  "24": "Let it be established and let Your name [and the character that name denotes] be magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.",
  "25": "For You, O my God, have told Your servant that You will build for him a house (a blessed posterity); therefore Your servant has found courage and confidence to pray before You.",
  "26": "And now, Lord, You are God, and have promised this good thing to Your servant.",
  "27": "Therefore may it please You to bless the house (posterity) of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for what You bless, O Lord, is blessed forever."
