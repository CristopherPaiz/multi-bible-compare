  "1": "THEN WE turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord directed me; and for many days we journeyed around Mount Seir.",
  "2": "And the Lord spoke to me [Moses], saying,",
  "3": "You have roamed around this mountain country long enough; turn northward.",
  "4": "And command the Israelites, You are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So watch yourselves carefully.",
  "5": "Do not provoke or stir them up, for I will not give you of their land, no, not enough for the sole of your foot to tread on, for I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.",
  "6": "You shall buy food from them for money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.",
  "7": "For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.",
  "8": "So we passed on from our brethren the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, away from the Arabah (wilderness), and from Elath and from Ezion-geber. We turned and went by the way of the wilderness of Moab.",
  "9": "And the Lord said to me, Do not trouble or assault Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.",
  "10": "(The Emim dwelt there in times past, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim.",
  "11": "These also are known as Rephaim [of giant stature], as are the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.",
  "12": "The Horites also formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead, as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave to them.)",
  "13": "Now rise up and go over the brook Zered. So we went over the brook Zered.",
  "14": "And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we had come over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them.",
  "15": "Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them to exterminate them from the midst of the camp, until they were all gone.",
  "16": "So when all the men of war had died from among the people,",
  "17": "The Lord spoke to me [Moses], saying,",
  "18": "You are this day to pass through Ar, the border of Moab.",
  "19": "But when you come near the territory of the sons of Ammon, do not trouble or assault them or provoke or stir them up, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites for a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.",
  "20": "(That also is known as a land of Rephaim [of giant stature]; Rephaim dwelt there formerly, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,",
  "21": "A people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them before [Ammon], and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead,",
  "22": "As He did for the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead even to this day.",
  "23": "As for the Avvim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.)",
  "24": "Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it and contend with him in battle.",
  "25": "This day will I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples who are under the whole heavens, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.",
  "26": "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,",
  "27": "Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road, turning aside neither to the right nor to the left.",
  "28": "You shall sell me food to eat and sell me water to drink; only let me walk through,",
  "29": "As the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, who dwell in Ar, did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us.",
  "30": "But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might give him into your hand, as at this day.",
  "31": "And the Lord said to me [Moses], Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may succeed him and occupy his land.",
  "32": "Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.",
  "33": "And the Lord our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.",
  "34": "At the same time we took all his cities and utterly destroyed every city--men, women, and children. We left none to remain.",
  "35": "Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.",
  "36": "From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon Valley, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was no city too high and strong for us; the Lord our God delivered all to us.",
  "37": "Only you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, that is, to any bank of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the Lord our God had forbidden us."
