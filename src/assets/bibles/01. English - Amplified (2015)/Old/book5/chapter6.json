  "7": "You shall whet and sharpen them so as to make them penetrate, and teach and impress them diligently upon the [minds and] hearts of your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up.",
  "8": "And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets (forehead bands) between your eyes.",
  "9": "And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates.",
  "10": "And when the Lord your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you, with great and goodly cities which you did not build,",
  "11": "And houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and cisterns hewn out which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and when you eat and are full,",
  "12": "Then beware lest you forget the Lord, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.",

  "17": "You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God and His exhortations and His statutes which He commanded you.",
  "18": "And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may go well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers,",
  "19": "To cast out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has promised.",
  "20": "When your son asks you in time to come, What is the meaning of the testimonies and statutes and precepts which the Lord our God has commanded you?",
