  "8": "You shall not do according to all we do here [in the camp] this day, every man doing whatever looks right in his own eyes.",
  "9": "For you have not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God gives you.",
  "10": "But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God causes you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about so that you dwell in safety,",
  "11": "Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His Name [and His Presence] to dwell there; to it you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes and what the hand presents [as a first gift from the fruits of the ground], and all your choicest offerings which you vow to the Lord.",

  "14": "But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all I command you.",
  "15": "However, you may kill and eat flesh in any of your towns whenever you desire, according to the provision for the support of life with which the Lord your God has blessed you; those [ceremonially] unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the hart.",
  "16": "Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the ground as water.",
  "17": "You may not eat within your towns the tithe of your grain or of your new wine or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herd or flock, or anything you have vowed, or your freewill offerings, or the offerings from your hand [of garden products].",
  "18": "But you shall eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God shall choose, you and your son and your daughter, your manservant and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your towns; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God in all that you undertake.",
  "19": "Take heed not to forsake or neglect the Levite [God's minister] as long as you live in your land.",
  "20": "When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He promised you, and you say, I will eat flesh, because you crave flesh, you may eat flesh whenever you desire.",
  "21": "If the place where the Lord your God has chosen to put His Name [and Presence] is too far from you, then you shall kill from your herd or flock which the Lord has given you, as I [Moses] have commanded you; eat in your towns as much as you desire.",
  "22": "Just as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you may eat of it [but not offer it]; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.",
  "23": "Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you may not eat the life with the flesh.",
  "24": "You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.",
  "25": "You shall not eat it, that all may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord.",
  "26": "Only your holy things which you have [to offer] and what you have vowed you shall take, and go to the place [before the sanctuary] which the Lord shall choose.",
  "27": "And offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God, and you may eat the flesh.",
  "28": "Be watchful and obey all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God.",
  "29": "When the Lord your God cuts off before you the nations whom you go to dispossess, and you dispossess them and live in their land,",
  "30": "Be watchful that you are not ensnared into following them after they have been destroyed before you and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? We will do likewise.",
  "31": "You shall not do so to the Lord your God, for every abominable thing which the Lord hates they have done for their gods. For even their sons and their daughters they have burned in the fire to their gods.",
  "32": "Whatever I command you, be watchful to do it; you shall not add to it or diminish it."
