  "1": "AND THE word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
  "2": "Son of man, How is the wood of the grapevine [Israel] more than that of any tree, the vine branch which was among the trees of the forest? [Ps. 80:8-13; Jer. 2:21.]",
  "3": "Shall wood be taken from it to do any work? Or will men take a peg of it on which to hang any vessel?",
  "4": "Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire consumes both ends of it and the middle of it is charred. Is it suitable or profitable for any work?",
  "5": "Notice, even when it was whole, it was good for no work; how much less shall it be useful and profitable when the fire has devoured it and it is charred?",
  "6": "Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the grapevine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.",
  "7": "And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them, and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord, when I set My face against them.",
  "8": "And I will make the land desolate (laid waste and deserted) because they have acted faithlessly [through their idolatry], says the Lord."
