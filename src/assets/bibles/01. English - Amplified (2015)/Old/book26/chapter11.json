  "1": "MOREOVER, THE Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the Lord's house, which faces east. And behold, at the door of the gateway there were twenty-five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.",
  "2": "Then [the Spirit] said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city,",
  "3": "Who say, [The time] is not near to build houses; this city is the boiling pot and we are the flesh.",
  "4": "Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man!",
  "5": "And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and He said to me, Speak. Say, Thus says the Lord: This is what you thought, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mind.",
  "6": "You have multiplied your slain in this city and you have filled its streets with the slain.",
  "7": "Therefore thus says the Lord God: Your slain whom you have laid in your midst; they are the flesh and this city is the boiling pot, but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.",
  "8": "You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord God.",
  "9": "And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and execute judgments among you.",
  "10": "You shall fall by the sword; I will judge and punish you [before your neighbors] at the border or outside the land of Israel, and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord.",
  "11": "This city shall not be your boiling pot, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border or outside of Israel;",
  "12": "And you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.",
  "13": "And while I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice, Ah, Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?",
  "14": "And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
  "15": "Son of man, your brethren, even your kindred, your fellow exiles, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they of whom the [present] inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, They have gone far from the Lord [and from this land]; therefore this land is given to us for a possession.",
  "16": "Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God: Whereas I have removed [Israel] far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I have been to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries to which they have come.",
  "17": "Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give back to you the land of Israel.",
  "18": "And when they return there, they shall take away from it all traces of its detestable things and all its abominations (sex impurities and heathen religious practices).",
  "19": "And I will give them one heart [a new heart] and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take the stony [unnaturally hardened] heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh [sensitive and responsive to the touch of their God], [Ezek. 18:31; 36:26; II Cor. 3:3.]",
  "20": "That they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.",
  "21": "But as for those whose heart yearns for and goes after their detestable things and their loathsome abominations [associated with idolatry], I will repay their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord God.",
  "22": "Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels which were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel [the Shekinah, cloud] was over them.",
  "23": "Then the glory of the Lord rose up from over the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is on the east side of the city.",
  "24": "And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.",
  "25": "And I told the exiles everything that the Lord had shown me."
