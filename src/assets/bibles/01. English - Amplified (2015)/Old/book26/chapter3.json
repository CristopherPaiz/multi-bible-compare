  "1": "HE SAID to me, Son of man, eat what you find [in this book]; eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.",
  "2": "So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat the scroll.",
  "3": "And He said to me, Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it. Then I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
  "4": "And He said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.",
  "5": "For you are not sent to a people of a foreign speech and of a difficult language but to the house of Israel;",
  "6": "Not to many peoples of foreign speech and of a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to such people, they would have listened to you and heeded My words.",
  "7": "But the house of Israel will not listen to you and obey you since they will not listen to Me and obey Me, for all the house of Israel are impudent and stubborn of heart.",
  "8": "Behold, I have made your face strong and hard against their faces and your forehead strong and hard against their foreheads.",
  "9": "Like an adamant harder than flint or a diamond point have I made your forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. [Isa. 50:7; Jer. 1:18; 15:20; Mic. 3:8.]",
  "10": "Moreover, He said to me, Son of man, all My words that I shall speak to you, receive in your heart and hear with your ears.",
  "11": "And go, get you to the [Jewish] captives [in Babylon], to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord God, whether they will hear or refuse to hear.",
  "12": "Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing [saying], Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place [above the firmament].",
  "13": "I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched and joined each one the other [its sister wing], and I heard the noise of the wheels beside them and the noise of a great rushing.",
  "14": "So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away [in the vision], and I went in bitterness [of discouragement] in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.",
  "15": "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, who sat and dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat and remained there among them seven days, overwhelmed with astonishment and silent.",
  "16": "And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me:",
  "17": "Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at My mouth and give them warning from Me. [Isa. 52:8; 56:10; 62:6; Jer. 6:17.]",
  "18": "If I say to the wicked, You shall surely die, and you do not give him warning or speak to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at your hand.",
  "19": "Yet if you warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered yourself.",
  "20": "Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness (right doing and right standing with God) and some gift or providence which I lay before him he perverts into an occasion to sin and he commits iniquity, he shall die; because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood will I require at your hand.",
  "21": "Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also you have delivered yourself from guilt.",
  "22": "And the hand of the Lord was there upon me, and He said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain and I will talk with you there.",
  "23": "Then I arose and went forth into the plain, and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory I had seen by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.",
  "24": "Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; He spoke and said to me, Go, shut yourself up in your house.",
  "25": "But you, O son of man, behold, ropes will be put upon you and you will be bound with them, and you cannot go out among people.",
  "26": "And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk and be a reprover of the people, for they are a rebellious house.",
  "27": "But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to the people, Thus says the Lord God; he who hears, let him hear, and he who refuses to hear, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house."
