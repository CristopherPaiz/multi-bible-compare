  "1": "AND the man [an angel] brought me to [the Holy Place of] the temple and measured the wall pillars, six cubits broad on one side [of the ten-cubit door] and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle or tent [later called the temple].",
  "2": "And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the leaves of the door were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits.",
  "3": "Then the man [being an angel, and unrestricted] went inside [the inner room, but went alone] and measured each post of the door, two cubits, the doorway, six cubits, and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits. [Heb. 9:6, 7; 10:19-25.]",
  "4": "And he measured the length [of the interior of the second room] in the temple proper, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits; and he [came out and] said to me, This is the Most Holy Place (the Holy of Holies).",
  "5": "Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick [to accommodate side chambers]; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the temple proper on every side.",
  "6": "These side chambers were three stories high, one over another and thirty in each story; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold of the wall [of the house], but they did not have hold of the wall of the temple.",
  "7": "And the side rooms became broader as they encompassed the temple higher and higher, for the encircling of the house went higher and higher round about the temple; therefore the breadth of the house continued upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the highest one by way of the middle story [on a winding stairway].",
  "8": "I saw also that the temple had an elevation or foundation platform round about it. The foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed measure of six long cubits.",
  "9": "The thickness of the outer wall of the side chamber was five cubits, as was the width of that part of the foundation that was left free of the side chambers that belonged to the house.",
  "10": "And between [the free space of the foundation platform and] the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the temple on every side.",
  "11": "And the doors of the attached side chambers opened on the free space that was left, one door toward the north and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space on the foundation platform that was left free was five cubits round about.",
  "12": "And the building that faced the temple yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.",
  "13": "And the man [an angel in my vision] measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;",
  "14": "Also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.",
  "15": "Then the man [an angel] measured the length of the building on the west side of the yard with its walls on either side, a hundred cubits. The Holy Place of the temple, the inner Holy of Holies, and the outer vestibule",
  "16": "Were roofed over, and all three had latticed windows all around. The inside walls of the temple were paneled with wood round about from the floor up to the windows and from the windows to the roof,",
  "17": "Including the space above the door leading to the inner room, inside and out. And on the walls round about in the inner room and the Holy Place were carvings,",
  "18": "With figures of cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces,",
  "19": "So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made this way through all the house round about.",
  "20": "From the floor to above the entrance were cherubim and palm trees made, and also on the wall of the temple [the Holy Place].",
  "21": "The door frames of the temple were squared, and in front [outside of the sanctuary or Holy of Holies] was what appeared to be",
  "22": "An altar of wood, three cubits high and two cubits long [and wide]; and its corners, its base, and its sides were of wood. And the man [an angel] said to me, This is the table that is before the Lord.",
  "23": "And the temple or Holy Place and the sanctuary or Holy of Holies, had two doors [one for each of them].",
  "24": "And the doors had two leaves apiece, two folding leaves--two leaves for the one door and two leaves for the other door.",
  "25": "And there were carved on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like those carved upon the walls; and there was also a canopy of wood in front of the porch outside.",
  "26": "And there were recessed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side of the porch. Thus were the side chambers and the canopies of the house."
