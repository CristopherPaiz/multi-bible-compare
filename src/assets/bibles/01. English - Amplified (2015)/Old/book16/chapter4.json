  "1": "BUT WHEN Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and in a great rage, and he ridiculed the Jews.",
  "2": "And he said before his brethren and the army of Samaria, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things [at will and by themselves]? Will they [try to bribe their God] with sacrifices? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?",
  "3": "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him, and he said, What they build--if a fox climbs upon it, he will break down their stone wall.",
  "4": "[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their taunts upon their own heads, and give them for a prey in a land of their captivity.",
  "5": "Cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have vexed [with alarm] the builders and provoked You.",
  "6": "So we built the wall, and all [of it] was joined together to half its height, for the people had a heart and mind to work.",
  "7": "But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were going up and that the breaches were being closed, they were very angry.",
  "8": "And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem, to injure and cause confusion and failure in it.",
  "9": "But because of them we made our prayer to our God and set a watch against them day and night.",
  "10": "And [the leaders of] Judah said, The strength of the burden bearers is weakening, and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall.",
  "11": "And our enemies said, They will not know or see till we come into their midst and kill them and stop the work.",
  "12": "And when the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times, You must return [to guard our little villages]; from all places where they dwell they will be upon us.",
  "13": "So I set [armed men] behind the wall in places where it was least protected; I even thus used the people as families with their swords, spears, and bows.",
  "14": "I looked [them over] and rose up and said to the nobles and officials and the other people, Do not be afraid of the enemy; [earnestly] remember the Lord and imprint Him [on your minds], great and terrible, and [take from Him courage to] fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.",
  "15": "And when our enemies heard that their plot was known to us and that God had frustrated their purpose, we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work.",
  "16": "And from that time forth, half of my servants worked at the task, and the other half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah.",
  "17": "Those who built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves so that everyone worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other hand,",
  "18": "And every builder had his sword girded by his side, and so worked. And he who sounded the trumpet was at my side.",
  "19": "And I said to the nobles and officials and the rest of the people, The work is great and scattered, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another.",
  "20": "In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.",
  "21": "So we labored at the work while half of them held the spears from dawn until the stars came out.",
  "22": "At that time also I said to the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that at night they may be a guard to us and a laborer during the day.",
  "23": "So none of us--I, my kinsmen, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me--took off our clothes; each kept his weapon [in his hand for days]."
