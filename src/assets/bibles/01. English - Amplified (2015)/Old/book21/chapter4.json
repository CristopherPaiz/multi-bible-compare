  "2": "So I praised and thought more fortunate those who have been long dead than the living, who are still alive.",
  "3": "But better than them both [I thought] is he who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.",
  "4": "Then I saw that all painful effort in labor and all skill in work comes from man's rivalry with his neighbor. This is also vanity, a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it.",
  "5": "The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh [destroying himself by indolence].",

  "14": "Even though [the youth] comes out of prison to reign, while the other, born a king, becomes needy.",
  "15": "I saw all the living who walk under the sun with the youth who was to stand up in the king's stead.",
  "16": "There was no end to all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it."
