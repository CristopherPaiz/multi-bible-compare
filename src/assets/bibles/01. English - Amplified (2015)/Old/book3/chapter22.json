  "10": "No outsider [not of the family of Aaron] shall eat of the holy thing [which has been offered to God]; a sojourner with the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing.",
  "11": "But if a priest buys a slave with his money, the slave may eat of the holy thing, and he also who is born in the priest's house; they may eat of his food.",
  "12": "If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider [not of the priestly tribe], she shall not eat of the offering of the holy things.",

  "18": "Say to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites, Whoever of the house of Israel and of the foreigners in Israel brings his offering, whether to pay a vow or as a freewill offering which is offered to the Lord for a burnt offering",
  "19": "That you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish of the young bulls, the sheep, or the goats.",

  "24": "You shall not offer to the Lord any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or broken or cut, neither sacrifice it in your land.",
  "25": "Neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals obtained from a foreigner [who may wish to pay respect to the true God], because their defects render them unfit; there is a blemish in them; they will not be accepted for you.",
  "26": "And the Lord said to Moses,",
  "27": "When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain for seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord.",

  "31": "So shall you heartily accept My commandments and conform your life and conduct to them. I am the Lord.",
  "32": "Neither shall you profane My holy name [applying it to an idol, or treating it with irreverence or contempt or as a byword]; but I will be hallowed among the Israelites. I am the Lord, Who consecrates and makes you holy,",
  "33": "Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord."
