  "1": "AND THE Lord said to Moses,",
  "2": "Say to the Israelites, When a man shall make a special vow of persons to the Lord at your valuation,",
  "3": "Then your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.",
  "4": "And if the person is a female, your valuation shall be thirty shekels.",
  "5": "And if the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.",
  "6": "And if a child is from a month up to five years old, then your valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver and for the female three shekels.",
  "7": "And if the person is from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.",
  "8": "But if the man is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.",
  "9": "If it is a beast of which men offer an offering to the Lord, all that any man gives of such to the Lord shall be holy.",
  "10": "He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he makes any exchange of a beast for a beast, then both the original offering and that exchanged for it shall be holy.",
  "11": "If it is an unclean animal, such as is not offered as an offering to the Lord, he shall bring the animal before the priest,",
  "12": "And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so shall it be.",
  "13": "But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to your valuation.",
  "14": "If a man dedicates his house to be sacred to the Lord, the priest shall appraise it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest appraises it, so shall it stand.",
  "15": "If he who dedicates his house wants to redeem it, he shall add a fifth of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.",
  "16": "And if a man shall dedicate to the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed [required] for it; [a sowing of] a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.",
  "17": "If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee, it shall stand according to your full valuation.",
  "18": "But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall count the money value in proportion to the years that remain until the Year of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.",
  "19": "If he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the money of your appraisal to it, and it shall remain his.",
  "20": "But if he does not want to redeem the field, or if he has sold it to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.",
  "21": "But the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the Lord, as a field devoted [to God or destruction]; the priest shall have possession of it.",
  "22": "And if a man dedicates to the Lord a field he has bought, which is not of the fields of his [ancestral] possession,",
  "23": "The priest shall compute the amount of your valuation for it up to the Year of Jubilee; the man shall give that amount on that day as a holy thing to the Lord.",
  "24": "In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, to him to whom the land belonged [as his ancestral inheritance].",
  "25": "And all your valuations shall be according to the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.",
  "26": "But the firstling of the animals, since a firstling belongs to the Lord, no man may dedicate, whether it be ox or sheep. It is the Lord's [already].",
  "27": "If it be of an unclean animal, the owner may redeem it according to your valuation, and shall add a fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.",
  "28": "But nothing that a man shall devote to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or beast or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the Lord.",
  "29": "No one doomed to death [under the claim of divine justice], who is to be completely destroyed from among men, shall be ransomed [from suffering the death penalty]; he shall surely be put to death.",
  "30": "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord. [I Cor. 9:11; Gal. 6:6.]",
  "31": "And if a man wants to redeem any of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it.",
  "32": "And all the tithe of the herd or of the flock, whatever passes under the herdsman's staff [by means of which each tenth animal as it passes through a small door is selected and marked], the tenth shall be holy to the Lord. [II Cor. 9:7-9.]",
  "33": "The man shall not examine whether the animal is good or bad nor shall he exchange it. If he does exchange it, then both it and the animal substituted for it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.",
  "34": "These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites. [Rom. 10:4; Heb. 4:2; 12:18-29.]"
