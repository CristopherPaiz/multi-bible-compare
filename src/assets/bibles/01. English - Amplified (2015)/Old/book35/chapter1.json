  "1": "THE BURDEN or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) which Habakkuk the prophet saw.",
  "2": "O Lord, how long shall I cry for help and You will not hear? Or cry out to You of violence and You will not save?",
  "3": "Why do You show me iniquity and wrong, and Yourself look upon or cause me to see perverseness and trouble? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention arises.",
  "4": "Therefore the law is slackened and justice and a righteous sentence never go forth, for the [hostility of the] wicked surrounds the [uncompromisingly] righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.",
  "5": "Look around [you, Habakkuk, replied the Lord] among the nations and see! And be astonished! Astounded! For I am putting into effect a work in your days [such] that you would not believe it if it were told you. [Acts 13:40, 41.]",
  "6": "For behold, I am rousing up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation who march through the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them. [II Kings 24:2.]",
  "7": "[The Chaldeans] are terrible and dreadful; their justice and dignity proceed [only] from themselves.",
  "8": "Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are fiercer than the evening wolves, and their horsemen spread themselves and press on proudly; yes, their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.",
  "9": "They all come for violence; their faces turn eagerly forward, and they gather prisoners together like sand.",
  "10": "They scoff at kings, and rulers are a derision to them; they ridicule every stronghold, for they heap up dust [for earth mounds] and take it.",
  "11": "Then they sweep by like a wind and pass on, and they load themselves with guilt, [as do all men] whose own power is their god.",
  "12": "Are not You from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O Lord, You have appointed [the Chaldean] to execute [Your] judgment, and You, O Rock, have established him for chastisement and correction. [Deut. 32:4.]",
  "13": "You are of purer eyes than to behold evil and can not look [inactively] upon injustice. Why then do You look upon the plunderer? Why are you silent when the wicked one destroys him who is more righteous than [the Chaldean oppressor] is?",
  "14": "Why do You make men like the fish of the sea, like reptiles and creeping things that have no ruler [and are defenseless against their foes]?",
  "15": "[The Chaldean] brings all of them up with his hook; he catches and drags them out with his net, he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is in high spirits.",
  "16": "Therefore he sacrifices [offerings] to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, because from them he lives luxuriously and his food is plentiful and rich.",
  "17": "Shall he therefore continue to empty his net and mercilessly go on slaying the nations forever?"
