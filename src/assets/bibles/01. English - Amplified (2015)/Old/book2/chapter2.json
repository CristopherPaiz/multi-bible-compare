  "1": "NOW [Amram] a man of the house of Levi [the priestly tribe] went and took as his wife [Jochebed] a daughter of Levi. [Exod. 6:18, 20; Num. 26:59.]",
  "2": "And the woman became pregnant and bore a son; and when she saw that he was [exceedingly] beautiful, she hid him three months. [Acts 7:20; Heb. 11:23.]",
  "3": "And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark or basket made of bulrushes or papyrus [making it watertight by] daubing it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the child in it and laid it among the rushes by the brink of the river [Nile].",
  "4": "And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to learn what would be done to him.",
  "5": "Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along the bank; she saw the ark among the rushes and sent her maid to fetch it.",
  "6": "When she opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the baby cried. And she took pity on him and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children!",
  "7": "Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?",
  "8": "Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.",
  "9": "Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed it.",
  "10": "And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she called him Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water.",
  "11": "One day, after Moses was grown, it happened that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of [Moses'] brethren.",
  "12": "He looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.",
  "13": "He went out the second day and saw two Hebrew men quarreling and fighting; and he said to the unjust aggressor, Why are you striking your comrade?",
  "14": "And the man said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid and thought, Surely this thing is known.",
  "15": "When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh's presence and took refuge in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.",
  "16": "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.",
  "17": "The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.",
  "18": "And when they came to Reuel [Jethro] their father, he said, How is it that you have come so soon today?",
  "19": "They said, An Egyptian delivered us from the shepherds; also he drew water for us and watered the flock.",
  "20": "He said to his daughters, Where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.",
  "21": "And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.",
  "22": "And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom [expulsion, or a stranger there]; for he said, I have been a stranger and a sojourner in a foreign land.",
  "23": "However, after a long time [nearly forty years] the king of Egypt died; and the Israelites were sighing and groaning because of the bondage. They kept crying, and their cry because of slavery ascended to God.",
  "24": "And God heard their sighing and groaning and [earnestly] remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.",
  "25": "God saw the Israelites and took knowledge of them and concerned Himself about them [knowing all, understanding, remembering all]. [Ps. 56:8, 9; 139:2.]"
