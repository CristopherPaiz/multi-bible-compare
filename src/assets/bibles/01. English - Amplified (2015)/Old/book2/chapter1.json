  "1": "THESE ARE the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:",
  "2": "Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,",
  "3": "Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,",
  "4": "Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.",
  "5": "All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.",
  "6": "Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.",
  "7": "But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was full of them.",
  "8": "Now a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.",
  "9": "He said to his people, Behold, the Israelites are too many and too mighty for us [and they outnumber us both in people and in strength].",
  "10": "Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply more and, should war befall us, they join our enemies, fight against us, and escape out of the land.",
  "11": "So they set over [the Israelites] taskmasters to afflict and oppress them with [increased] burdens. And [the Israelites] built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.",
  "12": "But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that [the Egyptians] were vexed and alarmed because of the Israelites.",
  "13": "And the Egyptians reduced the Israelites to severe slavery.",
  "14": "They made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar, brick, and all kinds of work in the field. All their service was with harshness and severity.",
  "15": "Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom one was named Shiprah and the other Puah,",
  "16": "When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.",
  "17": "But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but let the male babies live.",
  "18": "So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and allowed the male children to live?",
  "19": "The midwives answered Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and quickly delivered; their babies are born before the midwife comes to them.",
  "20": "So God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and became very strong.",
  "21": "And because the midwives revered and feared God, He made them households [of their own].",
  "22": "Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son born [to the Hebrews] you shall cast into the river [Nile], but every daughter you shall allow to live."
