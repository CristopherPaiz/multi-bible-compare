  "9": "Now behold, the cry of the Israelites has come to Me, and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.",
  "10": "Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.",

  "15": "God said also to Moses, This shall you say to the Israelites: The Lord, the God of your fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has sent me to you! This is My name forever, and by this name I am to be remembered to all generations.",
  "16": "Go, gather the elders of Israel together [the mature teachers and tribal leaders], and say to them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;",
