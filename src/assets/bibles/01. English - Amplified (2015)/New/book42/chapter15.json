  "1": "NOW THE tax collectors and [notorious and especially wicked] sinners were all coming near to [Jesus] to listen to Him.",
  "2": "And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining, saying, This man accepts and receives and welcomes [preeminently wicked] sinners and eats with them.",
  "3": "So He told them this parable:",
  "4": "What man of you, if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness (desert) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?",
  "5": "And when he has found it, he lays it on his [own] shoulders, rejoicing.",
  "6": "And when he gets home, he summons together [his] friends and [his] neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost.",
  "7": "Thus, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind, abhorring his errors and misdeeds, and determines to enter upon a better course of life) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.",
  "8": "Or what woman, having ten [silver] drachmas [each one equal to a day's wages], if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it?",
  "9": "And when she has found it, she summons her [women] friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the silver coin which I had lost.",
  "10": "Even so, I tell you, there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind for the better, heartily amending his ways, with abhorrence of his past sins).",
  "11": "And He said, There was a certain man who had two sons;",
  "12": "And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the part of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided the estate between them. [Deut. 21:15-17.]",
  "13": "And not many days after that, the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country, and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [from restraint] living.",
  "14": "And when he had spent all he had, a mighty famine came upon that country, and he began to fall behind and be in want.",
  "15": "So he went and forced (glued) himself upon one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed hogs.",
  "16": "And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating, but [they could not satisfy his hunger and] nobody gave him anything [better]. [Jer. 30:14.]",
  "17": "Then when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have enough food, and [even food] to spare, but I am perishing (dying) here of hunger!",
  "18": "I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.",
  "19": "I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] make me like one of your hired servants.",
  "20": "So he got up and came to his [own] father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [for him]; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [fervently].",
  "21": "And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours]!",
  "22": "But the father said to his bond servants, Bring quickly the best robe (the festive robe of honor) and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet. [Gen. 41:42; Zech. 3:4.]",
  "23": "And bring out that [wheat-]fattened calf and kill it; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry,",
  "24": "Because this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! And they began to revel and feast and make merry.",
  "25": "But his older son was in the field; and as he returned and came near the house, he heard music and dancing.",
  "26": "And having called one of the servant [boys] to him, he began to ask what this meant.",
  "27": "And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed that [wheat-]fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and well.",
  "28": "But [the elder brother] was angry [with deep-seated wrath] and resolved not to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him,",
  "29": "But he answered his father, Look! These many years I have served you, and I have never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me [so much as] a [little] kid, that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends;",
  "30": "But when this son of yours arrived, who has devoured your estate with immoral women, you have killed for him that [wheat-] fattened calf!",
  "31": "And the father said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.",
  "32": "But it was fitting to make merry, to revel and feast and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!"
