{
  "1": "NOW THE Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover.",
  "2": "And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [Jesus], for they feared the people.",
  "3": "But [then] Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles].",
  "4": "And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them.",
  "5": "And they were delighted and pledged [themselves] to give him money.",
  "6": "So he agreed [to this], and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [without an uprising] in the absence of the throng.",
  "7": "Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be slain. [Exod. 12:18-20; Deut. 16:5-8.]",
  "8": "So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, that we may eat it.",
  "9": "They said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare [it]?",
  "10": "He said to them, Behold, when you have gone into the city, a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters,",
  "11": "And say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples?",
  "12": "And he will show you a large room upstairs, furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations.",
  "13": "And they went and found it [just] as He had said to them; and they made ready the Passover [supper].",
  "14": "And when the hour came, [Jesus] reclined at table, and the apostles with Him.",
  "15": "And He said to them, I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;",
  "16": "For I say to you, I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.",
  "17": "And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He said, Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves;",
  "18": "For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes.",
  "19": "Then He took a loaf [of bread], and when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and gave it to them saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.",
  "20": "And in like manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament or covenant [ratified] in My blood, which is shed (poured out) for you.",
  "21": "But, behold, the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table. [Ps. 41:9.]",
  "22": "For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up!",
  "23": "And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this. [Ps. 41:9.]",
  "24": "Now an eager contention arose among them [as to] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest.",
  "25": "But Jesus said to them, The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers.",
  "26": "But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary, let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves.",
  "27": "For who is the greater, the one who reclines at table (the master), or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves.",
  "28": "And you are those who have remained [throughout] and persevered with Me in My trials;",
  "29": "And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me, so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree],",
  "30": "That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
  "31": "Simon, Simon (Peter), listen! Satan has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God], that he might sift [all of] you like grain, [Job 1:6-12; Amos 9:9.]",
  "32": "But I have prayed especially for you [Peter], that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again, strengthen and establish your brethren.",
  "33": "And [Simon Peter] said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.",
  "34": "But Jesus said, I tell you, Peter, before a [single] cock shall crow this day, you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me.",
  "35": "And He said to them, When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals, did you lack anything? They answered, Nothing!",
  "36": "Then He said to them, But now let him who has a purse take it, and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword.",
  "37": "For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted and classed among the wicked (the outlaws, the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled]. [Isa. 53:12.]",
  "38": "And they said, Look, Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.",
  "39": "And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed Him.",
  "40": "And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation.",
  "41": "And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed,",
  "42": "Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but [always] Yours be done.",
  "43": "And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him in spirit.",
  "44": "And being in an agony [of mind], He prayed [all the] more earnestly and intently, and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground.",
  "45": "And when He got up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief,",
  "46": "And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation.",
  "47": "And while He was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve [apostles], was going before [leading] them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him,",
  "48": "But Jesus said to him, Judas! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss?",
  "49": "And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?",
  "50": "And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear, the right one.",
  "51": "But Jesus said, Permit them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the little (insignificant) ear and healed him.",
  "52": "Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him--the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]--Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber?",
  "53": "When I was with you day after day in the temple [enclosure], you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour--and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way].",
  "54": "Then they seized Him and led Him away, bringing Him into the house of the high priest. Peter was following at a distance.",
  "55": "And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together, Peter sat among them.",
  "56": "Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [intently] at him, said, This man too was with Him.",
  "57": "But he denied it and said, Woman, I do not know Him!",
  "58": "And a little later someone else saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not!",
  "59": "And when about an hour more had elapsed, still another emphatically insisted, It is the truth that this man also was with Him, for he too is a Galilean!",
  "60": "But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And instantly, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.",
  "61": "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord's words, how He had told him, Before the cock crows today, you will deny Me thrice.",
  "62": "And he went out and wept bitterly [that is, with painfully moving grief].",
  "63": "Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him;",
  "64": "They blindfolded Him also and asked Him, Prophesy! Who is it that struck You?",
  "65": "And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him, reviling Him.",
  "66": "As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Him into their council (the Sanhedrin), and they said,",
  "67": "If You are the Christ (the Messiah), tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe (trust in, cleave to, and rely on what I say),",
  "68": "And if I question you, you will not answer.",
  "69": "But hereafter (from this time on), the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God. [Ps. 110:1.]",
  "70": "And they all said, You are the Son of God, then? And He said to them, It is just as you say; I AM.",
  "71": "And they said, What further evidence do we need? For we have heard [it] ourselves from His own mouth!"
