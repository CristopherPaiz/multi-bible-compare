  "1": "At which time [fig., Meanwhile], when the countless thousands of the crowd had been gathered together, so as to be trampling on one another, He began to be saying to His disciples first [of all], \"You* yourselves be watching out for the leaven [or, yeast] of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy [or, insincerity].",
  "2": "\"But nothing has been concealed which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not made known.",
  "3": "\"Because whatever you* said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you* spoke to the ear in private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.",
  "4": "\"Now I say to you*, My friends, do not be afraid of the ones killing the body, and after these [things] are not having anything further to do.",
  "5": "\"But I will show to you* whom you* should fear: fear the [One, who] after [having] killed is having authority to cast into hell [Gr., gehenna]. Yes, I say to you*, fear this [One]!",
  "6": "\"Five sparrows are sold [for] two assars [about 1/32 of an ounce or 0.44 grams of silver], are they not? And not one of them has been forgotten before God.",
  "7": "\"_But_ even the hairs of your* head have all been numbered. Therefore, stop fearing. You* are worth more than many sparrows!",
  "8": "\"Now I say to you*, all who shall confess Me before the people, the Son of Humanity also will confess with him before the angels of God.",
  "9": "\"But the one having denied [or, disowned] Me before the people will be denied before the angels of God.",
  "10": "\"And all who will speak a word against the Son of Humanity, it will be forgiven to him; but to the one having spoken against [or, having blasphemed] the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.",
  "11": "\"Now when they shall be bringing you* before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, stop being anxious how or what you* are to speak in your* defense, or what you* should say.",
  "12": "\"For the Holy Spirit will teach you* in that very hour what it is necessary to say.\"",
  "13": "Then someone from the crowd said to Him, \"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\"",
  "14": "But He said to him, \"Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider [or, an arbitrator] over you*?\"",
  "15": "Then He said to them, \"Be watching out for and be guarding yourselves against covetous desire [or, greed], because not in the abounding of his possessions is his life [fig., a person's life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions].\"",
  "16": "So He spoke an allegory to them, saying, \"The field of a certain rich man brought forth well [fig., produced a bountiful harvest].",
  "17": "\"And he was pondering within himself, saying, 'What shall I do, because I do not have where I will gather [fig., room to store] my harvest?'",
  "18": "\"And he said, 'This I will do: I will tear down my barns, and I will build larger ones, and there I will gather together [fig., store] all my crops and my goods.",
  "19": "'And I will say to my soul, \"Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years, be resting [or, be taking it easy], eat, drink, [and] be celebrating!\"'",
  "20": "\"But God said to him, 'Fool! This night they are demanding your soul from you. Now what you prepared, to whom will it be [fig., belong]?'",
  "21": "\"In the same way [is] the one storing up [earthly riches] for himself and [who] is not rich toward God.\"",
  "22": "Then He said to His disciples, \"For this reason I say to you*, stop being anxious [about] your* life, what you* shall eat, and [about] the body, what you* shall wear.",
  "23": "\"The life is more [than] nourishment, and the body [is more than] clothing.",
  "24": "\"Be considering the ravens, for they do not sow nor reap, to which there is no [fig., which do not have] storeroom nor barn, and God provides for them. How much more valuable you* are than the birds!",
  "25": "\"But which of you* [by] being anxious is able to add one cubit [about 18 inches or 45 centimeters] to his height?",
  "26": "\"So if you* are not able [to do] a very little [thing], why are you* anxious [about] the rest?",
  "27": "\"Consider the lilies, how do they grow? They do not labor nor do they spin. But I say to you*, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.",
  "28": "\"But if God clothes in such a manner the grass in the field, being [here] today and tomorrow is thrown into a furnace, how much more [will He clothe] you*, [O you*] of little faith?",
  "29": "\"And_you*_, stop seeking what you* shall eat or what you* shall drink, and stop being upset.",
  "30": "\"For all these [things] the nations of the world seek after, but your* Father knows that you* have need of these [things].",
  "31": "\"Nevertheless, be seeking the kingdom of God, and all these [things] will be added to you*.",
  "32": "\"Stop being afraid, little flock, because your* Father was delighted to give to you* the kingdom.",
  "33": "\"Sell your* possessions and give charitable gifts. Make for yourselves money bags [which] are not wearing out, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where a thief does not come near nor does a moth destroy.",
  "34": "\"For where your* treasure is, there your* heart [fig., inner desire] will be also.",
  "35": "\"Let your* waist be wrapped around [with a belt] [fig., Prepare yourselves], and [keep] the lamps burning.",
  "36": "\"And you* [are to be] like people waiting for their lord, when he returns from the wedding feasts, so that having come and knocked, immediately they shall open to him.",
  "37": "\"Happy [are] those slaves, whom the lord having come will find keeping watch. Positively, I say to you*, he will wrap [a belt] around himself and have them recline [to eat], and having come alongside, he will serve them.",
  "38": "\"And if he comes in the second watch [i.e. between 9:00 p.m. and midnight], [or] he even comes in the third watch [i.e. between midnight and 3:00 a.m.], and he finds [them] so, happy are those slaves.",
  "39": "\"But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief [was] coming, he would have kept watch and would not have allowed [the walls of] his house to be dug through.",
  "40": "\"Therefore,_you*_ also become ready, because the Son of Humanity is coming at the hour you* do not think [fig., expect].\"",
  "41": "Now Peter said to Him, \"Lord, do You speak this allegory to us, or also to all?\"",
  "42": "Then the Lord said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom the lord will put in charge over his household servants to give [them their] food allowance at [the right] time?",
  "43": "\"Happy [is] that slave, whom his lord having come, will find so doing.",
  "44": "\"Truly I say to you*, he will put him in charge over all his possessions.",
  "45": "\"But if that slave says in his heart, 'My lord is delaying to be coming,' and he begins to be beating the slave-boys and the slave-girls and to be eating and to be drinking and to be getting drunk,",
  "46": "the lord of that slave will come in a day in which he does not expect [him], and in an hour which he does not know, and he will cut him in two [fig., punish him severely], and he will appoint his portion with the unbelievers.",
  "47": "\"So that slave, the one having known his lord's will and not having prepared nor having done according to his will, will be repeatedly beaten with many [lashes].",
  "48": "\"But the one not having known, and having done [things] worthy of a beating, will be repeatedly beaten with few [lashes]. So to every [one] to whom much was given, much will be demanded from him, and to whom they entrusted much, all the more they will ask of him.",
  "49": "\"I came to cast fire to the earth, and how I wish that it was already kindled!",
  "50": "\"But I have a baptism to be baptized [with], and how distressed I am until it is completed!",
  "51": "\"Do you* think that I came to give peace on the earth? Not at all, I say to you*,_but_ rather division!",
  "52": "\"For from now [on] five in one house will have been divided: three against two and two against three.",
  "53": "\"A father will be divided against a son and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\" [see Micah 7:6]",
  "54": "Then He also said to the crowds, \"Whenever you* see the cloud rising from [the] west, immediately you* say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.",
  "55": "\"And whenever [you* see] a south wind blowing, you say*, 'It will be scorching heat [i.e., It will be a hot day],' and so it happens.",
  "56": "\"Hypocrites! You know [how] to be interpreting the face of the earth and of the sky, but how [is it] you* are not interpreting this time?",
  "57": "\"But why do you* not even judge of yourselves the righteous [thing] [fig., what is righteous]?",
  "58": "\"For as you* are going with your opponent [in a lawsuit] to a ruler [or, magistrate], on the way give work [fig., make every effort] to have been released from [fig., to make an settlement with] him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison.",
  "59": "\"I say to you, by no means shall you come out from there until you pay back even the last lepton [i.e. a small copper coin worth 1/1000th of an ounce or 0.025 grams of silver].\""
