  "8": "Will he not instead tell him, Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink?",
  "9": "Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do?",
  "10": "Even so on your part, when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you, say, We are unworthy servants [possessing no merit, for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have [merely] done what was our duty to do.",

  "23": "And they will say to you, Look! [He is] there! or, Look! [He is] here! But do not go out or follow [them].",

  "26": "And [just] as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the time of the Son of Man.",
