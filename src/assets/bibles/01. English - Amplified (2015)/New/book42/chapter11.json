  "4": "'And forgive us our sins, for also we ourselves forgive every [one] being indebted to us; and do not lead us into temptation,_but_ deliver us from evil [or, the evil [one]].'\"",
  "5": "And He said to them, \"Which of you* will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,",

  "7": "and that [one] answering from within shall say, 'Stop causing me troubles! The door has already been shut, and my young children are with me in bed. I am not able, having gotten up, to give to you.'",
  "8": "\"I say to you*, even if he will not give to him, having gotten up, because of him being a friend, yet because of his shameless persistence, having gotten up, he will give to him as much as he needs.",
  "9": "\"And_I_ say to you*, be asking, and it will be given to you*; be seeking, and you* will find; be knocking, and it will be opened to you*.",

  "12": "\"Or also if he asks [for] an egg, he will not give to him a scorpion, will he?",
  "13": "\"If you* then being evil know [how] to be giving good gifts to your* children, how much more will the Father of heaven [fig., your* heavenly Father] give [the] Holy Spirit to the ones asking Him?\"",
  "14": "And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. Then it happened, the demon having gone out, the mute [person] spoke, and the crowds marveled.",

  "17": "But knowing their thoughts,_He_ said to them, \"Every kingdom having been divided against itself is laid waste, and a house [divided] against a house falls.",
  "18": "\"So if Satan also was divided against himself, how will his kingdom be made to stand? Because you* say [that] I am casting out demons by Beelzebul.",
  "19": "\"But if_I_ cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your* sons [fig., disciples] cast [them] out? For this reason they will be your* judges.",

  "29": "Now [as] the crowds gathered even more, He began to be saying, \"This generation is evil. It seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.",

  "31": "\"[The] Queen of [the] South will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And listen! [One] greater than Solomon [is] here!",

  "34": "\"The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is healthy, your whole body is also full of light. But when it is bad, your body is also dark.",
  "35": "\"Therefore, be watching out lest the light, the [one] in you, is darkness.",
  "36": "\"So if your whole body is full of light, not having any part darkened, the whole will be full of light, like when the lamp by its brightness shall be giving you light.\"",
  "37": "Now while [He] [was] speaking, a certain Pharisee was asking Him that He should dine with him. So having entered, He reclined [to eat].",
  "38": "But the Pharisee having seen, marveled that He was not first baptized [or, ceremonially washed] before the meal.",
  "39": "Then the Lord said to him, \"Now you*, the Pharisees, make the outside of the cup and of the wooden platter clean, but the inside of you* is full of violent greed and wickedness.",
  "40": "\"Fools! The One having made the outside also made the inside, did He not?",
  "41": "\"Nevertheless, give the [things] being [or, what is] inside [as] charitable gifts. Then listen! All things are clean to you*.",
  "42": "\"_But_ how horrible it will be to you*, the Pharisees! Because you* tithe [i.e. give a tenth of] the mint and the rue [i.e. a scented herb] and every vegetable, and you* pass by [fig., overlook] the justice and the love of God. These [things] it is necessary to do, and those not to be neglecting.",
  "43": "\"How horrible it will be to you*, the Pharisees! Because you* love the first seats [fig., most important places] in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.",
  "44": "\"How horrible it will be to you*, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you* are like the unmarked tombs, and the people walking about above do not know [it].\"",
  "45": "Then answering, one of the lawyers says to Him, \"Teacher, by saying these [things] You also insult us.\"",
  "46": "But He said, \"How horrible it will be to you* also, the lawyers! Because you* burden the people with hard to carry [fig., difficult] burdens, and you* yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your* fingers.",
  "47": "\"How horrible it will be to you*! Because you* build the tombs of the prophets, but your* fathers killed them.",
  "48": "\"Consequently, you* bear witness to and approve of the works of your* fathers, because_they_ indeed killed them, but you* build their tombs!",
  "49": "\"For this reason the wisdom of God also said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they will kill, and [some] they will persecute,",

  "51": "from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, the one having perished between the altar and the house [of God]. Yes, I say to you*, it will be charged against this generation. [Gen 4:8; 2Chron 36:16]",
  "52": "\"How horrible it will be to you*, the lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You* yourselves did not enter, and you* hindered the ones entering in.\"",
  "53": "Now while He [was] speaking these [things] to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly hostile towards [Him] and to be attacking Him with questions concerning many things,",
