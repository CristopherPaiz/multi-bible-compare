  "1": "I AM the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser.",
  "2": "Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit.",
  "3": "You are cleansed and pruned already, because of the word which I have given you [the teachings I have discussed with you].",
  "4": "Dwell in Me, and I will dwell in you. [Live in Me, and I will live in you.] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in (being vitally united to) the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me.",
  "5": "I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much (abundant) fruit. However, apart from Me [cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing.",
  "6": "If a person does not dwell in Me, he is thrown out like a [broken-off] branch, and withers; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and they are burned.",
  "7": "If you live in Me [abide vitally united to Me] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.",
  "8": "When you bear (produce) much fruit, My Father is honored and glorified, and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine.",
  "9": "I have loved you, [just] as the Father has loved Me; abide in My love [continue in His love with Me].",
  "10": "If you keep My commandments [if you continue to obey My instructions], you will abide in My love and live on in it, just as I have obeyed My Father's commandments and live on in His love.",
  "11": "I have told you these things, that My joy and delight may be in you, and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing.",
  "12": "This is My commandment: that you love one another [just] as I have loved you.",
  "13": "No one has greater love [no one has shown stronger affection] than to lay down (give up) his own life for his friends.",
  "14": "You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do.",
  "15": "I do not call you servants (slaves) any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing (working out). But I have called you My friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father. [I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him.]",
  "16": "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [I have planted you], that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing, and that your fruit may be lasting [that it may remain, abide], so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [as presenting all that I AM], He may give it to you.",
  "17": "This is what I command you: that you love one another.",
  "18": "If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you.",
  "19": "If you belonged to the world, the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world [no longer one with it], but I have chosen (selected) you out of the world, the world hates (detests) you.",
  "20": "Remember that I told you, A servant is not greater than his master [is not superior to him]. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings, they will also keep and obey yours.",
  "21": "But they will do all this to you [inflict all this suffering on you] because of [your bearing] My name and on My account, for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me.",
  "22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin [would be blameless]; but now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "23": "Whoever hates Me also hates My Father.",
  "24": "If I had not done (accomplished) among them the works which no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of sin. But [the fact is] now they have both seen [these works] and have hated both Me and My Father.",
  "25": "But [this is so] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled, They hated Me without a cause. [Ps. 35:19; 69:4.]",
  "26": "But when the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth Who comes (proceeds) from the Father, He [Himself] will testify regarding Me.",
  "27": "But you also will testify and be My witnesses, because you have been with Me from the beginning."
