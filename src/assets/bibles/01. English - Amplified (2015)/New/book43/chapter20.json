  "1": "NOW ON the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been removed from (lifted out of the groove across the entrance of) the tomb.",
  "2": "So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus [tenderly] loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him!",
  "3": "Upon this, Peter and the other disciple came out and they went toward the tomb.",
  "4": "And they came running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first.",
  "5": "And stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not enter.",
  "6": "Then Simon Peter came up, following him, and went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there;",
  "7": "But the burial napkin (kerchief) which had been around Jesus' head, was not lying with the other linen cloths, but was [still] rolled up (wrapped round and round) in a place by itself.",
  "8": "Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went in too; and he saw and was convinced and believed.",
  "9": "For as yet they did not know (understand) the statement of Scripture that He must rise again from the dead. [Ps. 16:10.]",
  "10": "Then the disciples went back again to their homes (lodging places).",
  "11": "But Mary remained standing outside the tomb sobbing. As she wept, she stooped down [and looked] into the tomb.",
  "12": "And she saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.",
  "13": "And they said to her, Woman, why are you sobbing? She told them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.",
  "14": "On saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing [there], but she did not know (recognize) that it was Jesus.",
  "15": "Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you crying [so]? For Whom are you looking? Supposing that it was the gardener, she replied, Sir, if you carried Him away from here, tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away.",
  "16": "Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni!--which means Teacher or Master.",
  "17": "Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me [do not hold Me], for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brethren and tell them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.",
  "18": "Away came Mary Magdalene, bringing the disciples news (word) that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her.",
  "19": "Then on that same first day of the week, when it was evening, though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, Peace to you!",
  "20": "So saying, He showed them His hands and His side. And when the disciples saw the Lord, they were filled with joy (delight, exultation, ecstasy, rapture).",
  "21": "Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! [Just] as the Father has sent Me forth, so I am sending you.",
  "22": "And having said this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit!",
  "23": "[Now having received the Holy Spirit, and being led and directed by Him] if you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of anyone, they are retained.",
  "24": "But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.",
  "25": "So the other disciples kept telling him, We have seen the Lord! But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe [it].",
  "26": "Eight days later His disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though they were behind closed doors, and stood among them and said, Peace to you!",
  "27": "Then He said to Thomas, Reach out your finger here, and see My hands; and put out your hand and place [it] in My side. Do not be faithless and incredulous, but [stop your unbelief and] believe!",
  "28": "Thomas answered Him, My Lord and my God!",
  "29": "Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, do you now believe (trust, have faith)? Blessed and happy and to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me.",
  "30": "There are also many other signs and miracles which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book.",
  "31": "But these are written (recorded) in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ (the Anointed One), the Son of God, and that through believing and cleaving to and trusting and relying upon Him you may have life through (in) His name [through Who He is]. [Ps. 2:7, 12.]"
