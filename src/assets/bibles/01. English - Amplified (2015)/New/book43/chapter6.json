  "1": "AFTER THIS, Jesus went to the farther side of the Sea of Galilee--that is, the Sea of Tiberias.",
  "2": "And a great crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs (miracles) which He [continually] performed upon those who were sick.",
  "3": "And Jesus walked up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples.",
  "4": "Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was approaching.",
  "5": "Jesus looked up then, and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him, He said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, so that all these people may eat?",
  "6": "But He said this to prove (test) him, for He well knew what He was about to do.",
  "7": "Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennies' (forty dollars) worth of bread is not enough that everyone may receive even a little.",
  "8": "Another of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,",
  "9": "There is a little boy here, who has [with him] five barley loaves, and two small fish; but what are they among so many people?",
  "10": "Jesus said, Make all the people recline (sit down). Now the ground (a pasture) was covered with thick grass at the spot, so the men threw themselves down, about 5,000 in number.",
  "11": "Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples and the disciples to the reclining people; so also [He did] with the fish, as much as they wanted.",
  "12": "When they had all had enough, He said to His disciples, Gather up now the fragments (the broken pieces that are left over), so that nothing may be lost and wasted.",
  "13": "So accordingly they gathered them up, and they filled twelve [small hand] baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.",
  "14": "When the people saw the sign (miracle) that Jesus had performed, they began saying, Surely and beyond a doubt this is the Prophet Who is to come into the world! [Deut. 18:15, 18; John 1:21; Acts 3:22.]",
  "15": "Then Jesus, knowing that they meant to come and seize Him that they might make Him king, withdrew again to the hillside by Himself alone.",
  "16": "When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,",
  "17": "And they took a boat and were going across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and still Jesus had not [yet] come back to them.",
  "18": "Meanwhile, the sea was getting rough and rising high because of a great and violent wind that was blowing.",
  "19": "[However] when they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat. And they were afraid (terrified).",
  "20": "But Jesus said to them, It is I; be not afraid! [I AM; stop being frightened!] [Exod. 3:14.]",
  "21": "Then they were quite willing and glad for Him to come into the boat. And now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward. [And immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way.]",
  "22": "The next day the crowd [that still remained] standing on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away by themselves.",
  "23": "But now some other boats from Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
  "24": "So the people, finding that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.",
  "25": "And when they found Him on the other side of the lake, they said to Him, Rabbi! When did You come here?",
  "26": "Jesus answered them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, you have been searching for Me, not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied.",
  "27": "Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [in the using], but strive and work and produce rather for the [lasting] food which endures [continually] unto life eternal; the Son of Man will give (furnish) you that, for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him.",
  "28": "They then said, What are we to do, that we may [habitually] be working the works of God? [What are we to do to carry out what God requires?]",
  "29": "Jesus replied, This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to, trust, rely on, and have faith in His Messenger].",
  "30": "Therefore they said to Him, What sign (miracle, wonderwork) will You perform then, so that we may see it and believe and rely on and adhere to You? What [supernatural] work have You [to show what You can do]?",
  "31": "Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as the Scripture says, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. [Exod. 16:15; Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:24.]",
  "32": "Jesus then said to them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven], but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread.",
  "33": "For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.",
  "34": "Then they said to Him, Lord, give us this bread always (all the time)!",
  "35": "Jesus replied, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me will never be hungry, and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more (at any time).",
  "36": "But [as] I told you, although you have seen Me, still you do not believe and trust and have faith.",
  "37": "All whom My Father gives (entrusts) to Me will come to Me; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [I will never, no never, reject one of them who comes to Me].",
  "38": "For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me.",
  "39": "And this is the will of Him Who sent Me, that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me, but that I should give new life and raise [them all] up at the last day.",
  "40": "For this is My Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.",
  "41": "Now the Jews murmured and found fault with and grumbled about Jesus because He said, I am [Myself] the Bread that came down from heaven.",
  "42": "They kept asking, Is not this Jesus, the Son of Joseph, Whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, I have come down from heaven?",
  "43": "So Jesus answered them, Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another.",
  "44": "No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me, and [then] I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.",
  "45": "It is written in [the book of] the Prophets, And they shall all be taught of God [have Him in person for their Teacher]. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me--[Isa. 54:13.]",
  "46": "Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [not that anyone has ever seen Him] except He [Who was with the Father] Who comes from God; He [alone] has seen the Father.",
  "47": "I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, he who believes in Me [who adheres to, trusts in, relies on, and has faith in Me] has (now possesses) eternal life.",
  "48": "I am the Bread of Life [that gives life--the Living Bread].",
  "49": "Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and [yet] they died.",
  "50": "[But] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven, so that [any]one may eat of it and never die.",
  "51": "I [Myself] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (body).",
  "52": "Then the Jews angrily contended with one another, saying, How is He able to give us His flesh to eat?",
  "53": "And Jesus said to them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, you cannot have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood].",
  "54": "He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has (possesses now) eternal life, and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day.",
  "55": "For My flesh is true and genuine food, and My blood is true and genuine drink.",
  "56": "He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me, and I [in like manner dwell continually] in him.",
  "57": "Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by (through, because of) the Father, even so whoever continues to feed on Me [whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me] shall [in his turn] live through and because of Me.",
  "58": "This is the Bread that came down from heaven. It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate, and yet died; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever.",
  "59": "He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching at Capernaum.",
  "60": "When His disciples heard this, many of them said, This is a hard and difficult and strange saying (an offensive and unbearable message). Who can stand to hear it? [Who can be expected to listen to such teaching?]",
  "61": "But Jesus, knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it, said to them: Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you? [Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you?]",
  "62": "What then [will be your reaction] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [the place] where He was before?",
  "63": "It is the Spirit Who gives life [He is the Life-giver]; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [there is no profit in it]. The words (truths) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life.",
  "64": "But [still] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith. For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him.",
  "65": "And He said, This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [unless he is enabled to do so] by the Father.",
  "66": "After this, many of His disciples drew back (returned to their old associations) and no longer accompanied Him.",
  "67": "Jesus said to the Twelve, Will you also go away? [And do you too desire to leave Me?]",
  "68": "Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words (the message) of eternal life.",
  "69": "And we have learned to believe and trust, and [more] we have come to know [surely] that You are the Holy One of God, the Christ (the Anointed One), the Son of the living God.",
  "70": "Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And [yet] one of you is a devil (of the evil one and a false accuser).",
  "71": "He was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he was about to betray Him, [although] he was one of the Twelve."
