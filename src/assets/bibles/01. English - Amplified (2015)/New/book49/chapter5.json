  "1": "THEREFORE BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father].",
  "2": "And walk in love, [esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a slain offering and sacrifice to God [for you, so that it became] a sweet fragrance. [Ezek. 20:41.]",
  "3": "But immorality (sexual vice) and all impurity [of lustful, rich, wasteful living] or greediness must not even be named among you, as is fitting and proper among saints (God's consecrated people).",
  "4": "Let there be no filthiness (obscenity, indecency) nor foolish and sinful (silly and corrupt) talk, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting or becoming; but instead voice your thankfulness [to God].",
  "5": "For be sure of this: that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life, or one who is covetous [who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain]--for he [in effect] is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
  "6": "Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [for these sins], for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience.",
  "7": "So do not associate or be sharers with them.",
  "8": "For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [lead the lives of those native-born to the Light].",
  "9": "For the fruit (the effect, the product) of the Light or the Spirit [consists] in every form of kindly goodness, uprightness of heart, and trueness of life.",
  "10": "And try to learn [in your experience] what is pleasing to the Lord [let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him].",
  "11": "Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness, but instead [let your lives be so in contrast as to] expose and reprove and convict them.",
  "12": "For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [such people] practice in secret.",
  "13": "But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light, it is made visible and clear; and where everything is visible and clear there is light.",
  "14": "Therefore He says, Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine (make day dawn) upon you and give you light. [Isa. 26:19; 60:1, 2.]",
  "15": "Look carefully then how you walk! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless, but as wise (sensible, intelligent people),",
  "16": "Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity], because the days are evil.",
  "17": "Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish, but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is.",
  "18": "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [Holy] Spirit. [Prov. 23:20.]",
  "19": "Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, offering praise with voices [and instruments] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord,",
  "20": "At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.",
  "21": "Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).",
  "22": "Wives, be subject (be submissive and adapt yourselves) to your own husbands as [a service] to the Lord.",
  "23": "For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church, Himself the Savior of [His] body.",
  "24": "As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her,",
  "26": "So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word,",
  "27": "That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such things [that she might be holy and faultless].",
  "28": "Even so husbands should love their wives as [being in a sense] their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.",
  "29": "For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it, as Christ does the church,",
  "30": "Because we are members (parts) of His body.",
  "31": "For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. [Gen. 2:24.]",
  "32": "This mystery is very great, but I speak concerning [the relation of] Christ and the church.",
  "33": "However, let each man of you [without exception] love his wife as [being in a sense] his very own self; and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband [that she notices him, regards him, honors him, prefers him, venerates, and esteems him; and that she defers to him, praises him, and loves and admires him exceedingly]. [I Pet. 3:2.]"
