  "2": "While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate now for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.",
  "3": "Then after fasting and praying, they put their hands on them and sent them away.",
  "4": "So then, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from [that port] they sailed away to Cyprus.",
  "5": "When they arrived at Salamis, they preached the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John [Mark] as an attendant to assist them.",
  "6": "When they had passed through the entire island of Cyprus as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain Jewish wizard or sorcerer, a false prophet named Bar-Jesus.",
  "7": "He was closely associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent and sensible man of sound understanding; he summoned to him Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God [concerning salvation in the kingdom of God attained through Christ].",
  "8": "But Elymas the wise man--for that is the translation of his name [which he had given himself]--opposed them, seeking to keep the proconsul from accepting the faith.",
  "9": "But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit, looked steadily at [Elymas]",
  "10": "And said, You master in every form of deception and recklessness, unscrupulousness, and wickedness, you son of the devil, you enemy of everything that is upright and good, will you never stop perverting and making crooked the straight paths of the Lord and plotting against His saving purposes? [Hos. 14:9.]",
  "11": "And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, [so blind that you will be] unable to see the sun for a time. Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness, and he groped about seeking persons who would lead him by the hand.",

  "13": "Now Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John [Mark] separated himself from them and went back to Jerusalem,",
  "14": "But they [themselves] came on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue there and sat down.",
  "15": "After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders [of the worship] of the synagogue sent to them saying, Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation or consolation or encouragement for the people, say it.",
  "16": "So Paul arose, and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel and you who reverence and fear God, listen!",
  "17": "The God of this people Israel selected our forefathers and made this people great and important during their stay in the land of Egypt, and then with an uplifted arm He led them out from there. [Exod. 6:1, 6.]",
  "18": "And for about forty years like a fatherly nurse He cared for them in the wilderness and endured their behavior. [Deut. 1:31.]",
  "19": "When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave them [the Hebrews] their land as an inheritance [distributing it to them by lot; all of which took] about 450 years. [Deut. 7:1; Josh. 14:1.]",
  "20": "After that, He gave them judges until the prophet Samuel.",
  "21": "Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.",
  "22": "And when He had deposed him, He raised up David to be their king; of him He bore witness and said, I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart, who will do all My will and carry out My program fully. [I Sam. 13:14; Ps. 89:20; Isa. 44:28.]",
  "23": "Of this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior [in the person of Jesus], according to His promise.",
  "24": "Before His coming John had [already] preached baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.",
  "25": "And as John was ending his course, he asked, What or who do you secretly think that I am? I am not He [the Christ. No], but note that after me One is coming, the sandals of Whose feet I am not worthy to untie!",
  "26": "Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and all those others among you who reverence and fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation [the salvation obtained through Jesus Christ]. [Ps. 107:20.]",
  "27": "For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not know or recognize Him or understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, have actually fulfilled these very predictions by condemning and sentencing [Him].",
  "28": "And although they could find no cause deserving death with which to charge Him, yet they asked Pilate to have Him executed and put out of the way.",
  "29": "And when they had finished and fulfilled everything that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.",
  "30": "But God raised Him from the dead.",
  "31": "And for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are His witnesses to the people.",
  "32": "So now we are bringing you the good news (Gospel) that what God promised to our forefathers,",
  "33": "This He has completely fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You [caused You to arise, to be born; formally shown You to be the Messiah by the resurrection]. [Ps. 2:7.]",
  "34": "And as to His having raised Him from among the dead, now no more to return to [undergo] putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave], He spoke in this way, I will fulfill and give to you the holy and sure mercy and blessings [that were promised and assured] to David. [Isa. 55:3.]",
  "35": "For this reason He says also in another psalm, You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption [to undergo putrefaction and dissolution of the grave]. [Ps. 16:10.]",
  "36": "For David, after he had served God's will and purpose and counsel in his own generation, fell asleep [in death] and was buried among his forefathers, and he did see corruption and undergo putrefaction and dissolution [of the grave].",
  "37": "But He Whom God raised up [to life] saw no corruption [did not experience putrefaction and dissolution of the grave].",
  "38": "So let it be clearly known and understood by you, brethren, that through this Man forgiveness and removal of sins is now proclaimed to you;",
  "39": "And that through Him everyone who believes [who acknowledges Jesus as his Savior and devotes himself to Him] is absolved (cleared and freed) from every charge from which he could not be justified and freed by the Law of Moses and given right standing with God.",
  "40": "Take care, therefore, lest there come upon you what is spoken in the prophets:",
  "41": "Look, you scoffers and scorners, and marvel and perish and vanish away; for I am doing a deed in your days, a deed which you will never have confidence in or believe, [even] if someone [clearly describing it in detail] declares it to you. [Hab. 1:5.]",
  "42": "As they [Paul and Barnabas] went out [of the synagogue], the people earnestly begged that these things might be told to them [further] the next Sabbath.",
  "43": "And when the congregation of the synagogue dispersed, many of the Jews and the devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and urged them to continue [to trust themselves to and to stand fast] in the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God.",
  "44": "The next Sabbath almost the entire city gathered together to hear the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God].",
  "45": "But when the Jews saw the crowds, filled with envy and jealousy they contradicted what was said by Paul and talked abusively [reviling and slandering him].",
  "46": "And Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly and boldly, saying, It was necessary that God's message [concerning salvation through Christ] should be spoken to you first. But since you thrust it from you, you pass this judgment on yourselves that you are unworthy of eternal life and out of your own mouth you will be judged. [Now] behold, we turn to the Gentiles (the heathen).",
  "47": "For so the Lord has charged us, saying, I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles (the heathen), that you may bring [eternal] salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth. [Isa. 49:6.]",
  "48": "And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified (praised and gave thanks for) the Word of God; and as many as were destined (appointed and ordained) to eternal life believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Jesus as the Christ and their Savior).",
  "49": "And so the Word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through Christ] scattered and spread throughout the whole region.",
  "50": "But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high rank and the outstanding men of the town, and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their boundaries.",
  "51": "But [the apostles] shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.",
  "52": "And the disciples were continually filled [throughout their souls] with joy and the Holy Spirit."
