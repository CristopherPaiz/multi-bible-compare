  "1": "ABOUT THAT time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict and oppress and torment some who belonged to the church (assembly).",
  "2": "And he killed James the brother of John with a sword;",
  "3": "And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded further and arrested Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week].",
  "4": "And when he had seized [Peter], he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of soldiers of four each to guard him, purposing after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.",
  "5": "So Peter was kept in prison, but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church (assembly).",
  "6": "The very night before Herod was about to bring him forth, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.",
  "7": "And suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared [standing beside him], and a light shone in the place where he was. And the angel gently smote Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, Get up quickly! And the chains fell off his hands.",
  "8": "And the angel said to him, Tighten your belt and bind on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Wrap your outer garment around you and follow me.",
  "9": "And [Peter] went out [along] following him, and he was not conscious that what was apparently being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.",
  "10": "When they had passed through the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate which leads into the city. Of its own accord [the gate] swung open, and they went out and passed on through one street; and at once the angel left him.",
  "11": "Then Peter came to himself and said, Now I really know and am sure that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [to do to me].",
  "12": "When he, at a glance, became aware of this [comprehending all the elements of the case], he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where a large number were assembled together and were praying.",
  "13": "And when he knocked at the gate of the porch, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.",
  "14": "And recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she failed to open the gate, but ran in and told the people that Peter was standing before the porch gate.",
  "15": "They said to her, You are crazy! But she persistently and strongly and confidently affirmed that it was the truth. They said, It is his angel!",
  "16": "But meanwhile Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed.",
  "17": "But motioning to them with his hand to keep quiet and listen, he related to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison. And he said, Report all this to James [the Less] and to the brethren. Then he left and went to some other place.",
  "18": "Now as soon as it was day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.",
  "19": "And when Herod had looked for him and could not find him, he placed the guards on trial and commanded that they should be led away [to execution]. Then [Herod] went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed on there.",
  "20": "Now [Herod] cherished bitter animosity and hostility for the people of Tyre and Sidon; and [their deputies] came to him in a united body, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was nourished by and depended on the king's [country] for food.",
  "21": "On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in his royal robes, took his seat upon [his] throne, and addressed an oration to them.",
  "22": "And the assembled people shouted, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!",
  "23": "And at once an angel of the Lord smote him and cut him down, because he did not give God the glory (the preeminence and kingly majesty that belong to Him as the supreme Ruler); and he was eaten by worms and died.",
  "24": "But the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God] continued to grow and spread.",
  "25": "And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission, bringing with them John whose surname was Mark. [Acts 11:28-30.]"
