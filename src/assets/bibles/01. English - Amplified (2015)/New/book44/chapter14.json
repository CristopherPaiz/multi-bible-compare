  "10": "Shouted at him, saying, Stand erect on your feet! And he leaped up and walked.",
  "11": "And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, shouting in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us in human form!",
  "12": "They called Barnabas Zeus, and they called Paul, because he led in the discourse, Hermes [god of speech].",
  "13": "And the priest of Zeus, whose [temple] was at the entrance of the town, brought bulls and garlands to the [city's] gates and wanted to join the people in offering sacrifice.",
  "14": "But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothing and dashed out among the crowd, shouting,",
  "15": "Men, why are you doing this? We also are [only] human beings, of nature like your own, and we bring you the good news (Gospel) that you should turn away from these foolish and vain things to the living God, Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that they contain. [Exod. 20:11; Ps. 146:6.]",
  "16": "In generations past He permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;",

  "20": "But the disciples formed a circle about him, and he got up and went back into the town; and on the morrow he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.",

  "26": "And from there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had [first] been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had [now] completed.",
