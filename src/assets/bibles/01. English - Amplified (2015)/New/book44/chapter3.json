  "1": "NOW PETER and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour (three o'clock in the afternoon),",
  "2": "[When] a certain man crippled from his birth was being carried along, who was laid each day at that gate of the temple [which is] called Beautiful, so that he might beg for charitable gifts from those who entered the temple.",
  "3": "So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him a gift.",
  "4": "And Peter directed his gaze intently at him, and so did John, and said, Look at us!",
  "5": "And [the man] paid attention to them, expecting that he was going to get something from them.",
  "6": "But Peter said, Silver and gold (money) I do not have; but what I do have, that I give to you: in [the use of] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!",
  "7": "Then he took hold of the man's right hand with a firm grip and raised him up. And at once his feet and ankle bones became strong and steady,",
  "8": "And leaping forth he stood and began to walk, and he went into the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.",
  "9": "And all the people saw him walking about and praising God,",
  "10": "And they recognized him as the man who usually sat [begging] for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement (bewilderment, consternation) over what had occurred to him.",
  "11": "Now while he [still] firmly clung to Peter and John, all the people in utmost amazement ran together and crowded around them in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon's.",
  "12": "And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, You men of Israel, why are you so surprised and wondering at this? Why do you keep staring at us, as though by our [own individual] power or [active] piety we had made this man [able] to walk?",
  "13": "The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified His Servant and Son Jesus [doing Him this honor], Whom you indeed delivered up and denied and rejected and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to let Him go. [Exod. 3:6; Isa. 52:13.]",
  "14": "But you denied and rejected and disowned the Pure and Holy, the Just and Blameless One, and demanded [the pardon of] a murderer to be granted to you.",
  "15": "But you killed the very Source (the Author) of life, Whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.",
  "16": "And His name, through and by faith in His name, has made this man whom you see and recognize well and strong. [Yes] the faith which is through and by Him [Jesus] has given the man this perfect soundness [of body] before all of you.",
  "17": "And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance [not aware of what you were doing], as did your rulers also.",
  "18": "Thus has God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ (the Messiah) should undergo ill treatment and be afflicted and suffer.",
  "19": "So repent (change your mind and purpose); turn around and return [to God], that your sins may be erased (blotted out, wiped clean), that times of refreshing (of recovering from the effects of heat, of reviving with fresh air) may come from the presence of the Lord;",
  "20": "And that He may send [to you] the Christ (the Messiah), Who before was designated and appointed for you--even Jesus,",
  "21": "Whom heaven must receive [and retain] until the time for the complete restoration of all that God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets for ages past [from the most ancient time in the memory of man].",
  "22": "Thus Moses said to the forefathers, The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as [He raised up] me; Him you shall listen to and understand by hearing and heed in all things whatever He tells you.",
  "23": "And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to and understand by hearing and heed that Prophet shall be utterly exterminated from among the people. [Deut. 18:15-19.]",
  "24": "Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those who came afterwards, as many as have spoken, also promised and foretold and proclaimed these days.",
  "25": "You are the descendants (sons) of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant which God made and gave to your forefathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed (Heir) shall all the families of the earth be blessed and benefited. [Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16.]",
  "26": "It was to you first that God sent His Servant and Son Jesus, when He raised Him up [provided and gave Him for us], to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness and evil ways. [Acts 2:24; 3:22.]"
