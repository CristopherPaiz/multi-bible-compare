  "1": "AND [Paul] went down to Derbe and also to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer [she had become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of eternal salvation, and yielded obedience to Him]; but [Timothy's] father was a Greek.",
  "2": "He [Timothy] had a good reputation among the brethren at Lystra and Iconium.",
  "3": "Paul desired Timothy to go with him [as a missionary]; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, all of whom knew that his father was a Greek.",
  "4": "As they went on their way from town to town, they delivered over [to the assemblies] for their observance the regulations decided upon by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.",
  "5": "So the churches were strengthened and made firm in the faith, and they increased in number day after day.",
  "6": "And Paul and Silas passed through the territory of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Word in [the province of] Asia.",
  "7": "And when they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.",
  "8": "So passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.",
  "9": "[There] a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man from Macedonia stood pleading with him and saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us!",
  "10": "And when he had seen the vision, we [including Luke] at once endeavored to go on into Macedonia, confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the glad tidings (Gospel) to them.",
  "11": "Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came in a direct course to Samothrace, and the next day went on to Neapolis.",
  "12": "And from there [we came] to Philippi, which is the chief city of the district of Macedonia and a [Roman] colony. We stayed on in this place some days;",
  "13": "And on the Sabbath day we went outside the [city's] gate to the bank of the river where we supposed there was an [accustomed] place of prayer, and we sat down and addressed the women who had assembled there.",
  "14": "One of those who listened to us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a dealer in fabrics dyed in purple. She was [already] a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.",
  "15": "And when she was baptized along with her household, she earnestly entreated us, saying, If in your opinion I am one really convinced [that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of salvation] and that I will be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay. And she induced us [to do it].",
  "16": "As we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who was possessed by a spirit of divination [claiming to foretell future events and to discover hidden knowledge], and she brought her owners much gain by her fortunetelling.",
  "17": "She kept following Paul and [the rest of] us, shouting loudly, These men are the servants of the Most High God! They announce to you the way of salvation!",
  "18": "And she did this for many days. Then Paul, being sorely annoyed and worn out, turned and said to the spirit within her, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out that very moment.",
  "19": "But when her owners discovered that their hope of profit was gone, they caught hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the forum (marketplace), [where trials are held].",
  "20": "And when they had brought them before the magistrates, they declared, These fellows are Jews and they are throwing our city into great confusion.",
  "21": "They encourage the practice of customs which it is unlawful for us Romans to accept or observe!",
  "22": "The crowd [also] joined in the attack upon them, and the rulers tore the clothes off of them and commanded that they be beaten with rods.",
  "23": "And when they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.",
  "24": "He, having received [so strict a] charge, put them into the inner prison (the dungeon) and fastened their feet in the stocks.",
  "25": "But about midnight, as Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the [other] prisoners were listening to them,",
  "26": "Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the very foundations of the prison were shaken; and at once all the doors were opened and everyone's shackles were unfastened.",
  "27": "When the jailer, startled out of his sleep, saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself, because he supposed that the prisoners had escaped.",
  "28": "But Paul shouted, Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!",
  "29": "Then [the jailer] called for lights and rushed in, and trembling and terrified he fell down before Paul and Silas.",
  "30": "And he brought them out [of the dungeon] and said, Men, what is it necessary for me to do that I may be saved?",
  "31": "And they answered, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [give yourself up to Him, take yourself out of your own keeping and entrust yourself into His keeping] and you will be saved, [and this applies both to] you and your household as well.",
  "32": "And they declared the Word of the Lord [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] to him and to all who were in his house.",
  "33": "And he took them the same hour of the night and bathed [them because of their bloody] wounds, and he was baptized immediately and all [the members of] his [household].",
  "34": "Then he took them up into his house and set food before them; and he leaped much for joy and exulted with all his family that he believed in God [accepting and joyously welcoming what He had made known through Christ].",
  "35": "But when it was day, the magistrates sent policemen, saying, Release those fellows and let them go.",
  "36": "And the jailer repeated the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to release you and let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.",
  "37": "But Paul answered them, They have beaten us openly and publicly, without a trial and uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now thrust us out secretly? No, indeed! Let them come here themselves and conduct us out!",
  "38": "The police reported this message to the magistrates, and they were frightened when they heard that the prisoners were Roman citizens;",
  "39": "So they came themselves and [striving to appease them by entreaty] apologized to them. And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city.",
  "40": "So [Paul and Silas] left the prison and went to Lydia's house; and when they had seen the brethren, they warned and urged and consoled and encouraged them and departed."
