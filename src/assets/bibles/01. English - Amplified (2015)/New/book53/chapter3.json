  "1": "FURTHERMORE, BRETHREN, do pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may speed on (spread rapidly and run its course) and be glorified (extolled) and triumph, even as [it has done] with you,",
  "2": "And that we may be delivered from perverse (improper, unrighteous) and wicked (actively malicious) men, for not everybody has faith and is held by it.",
  "3": "Yet the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen [you] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [one].",
  "4": "And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you.",
  "5": "May the Lord direct your hearts into [realizing and showing] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and in waiting for His return.",
  "6": "Now we charge you, brethren, in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother (fellow believer) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly, living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us.",
  "7": "For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [we were not idle].",
  "8": "Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and struggle we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [for our support].",
  "9": "[It was] not because we do not have a right [to such support], but [we wished] to make ourselves an example for you to follow.",
  "10": "For while we were yet with you, we gave you this rule and charge: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat.",
  "11": "Indeed, we hear that some among you are disorderly [that they are passing their lives in idleness, neglectful of duty], being busy with other people's affairs instead of their own and doing no work.",
  "12": "Now we charge and exhort such persons [as ministers in Him exhorting those] in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities.",
  "13": "And as for you, brethren, do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [but continue in well-doing without weakening].",
  "14": "But if anyone [in the church] refuses to obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.",
  "15": "Do not regard him as an enemy, but simply admonish and warn him as [being still] a brother.",
  "16": "Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace (the peace of His kingdom) at all times and in all ways [under all circumstances and conditions, whatever comes]. The Lord [be] with you all.",
  "17": "I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the mark and sign [that it is not a forgery] in every letter of mine. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature].",
  "18": "The grace (spiritual blessing and favor) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it)."
