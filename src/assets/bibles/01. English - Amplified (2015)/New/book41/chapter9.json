  "1": "AND JESUS said to them, Truly and solemnly I say to you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death before they see the kingdom of God come in [its] power.",
  "2": "Six days after this, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them and became resplendent with divine brightness.",
  "3": "And His garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller (cloth dresser, launderer) on earth could bleach them.",
  "4": "And Elijah appeared [there] to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were holding [a protracted] conversation with Jesus.",
  "5": "And Peter took up the conversation, saying, Master, it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here. Let us make three booths (tents)--one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.",
  "6": "For he did not [really] know what to say, for they were in a violent fright (aghast with dread).",
  "7": "And a cloud threw a shadow upon them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the [most dearworthy] Beloved One. Be constantly listening to and obeying Him!",
  "8": "And looking around, they suddenly no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus only.",
  "9": "And as they were coming back down the mountain, He admonished and expressly ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man should rise from among the dead.",
  "10": "So they carefully and faithfully kept the matter to themselves, questioning and disputing with one another about what rising from among the dead meant.",
  "11": "And they asked Him, Why do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first? [Mal. 4:5, 6.]",
  "12": "And He said to them, Elijah, it is true, does come first to restore all things and set them to rights. And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected? [Isa. 53:3.]",
  "13": "But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and [people] did to him whatever they desired, as it is written of him.",
  "14": "And when they came to the [nine] disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes questioning and disputing with them.",
  "15": "And immediately all the crowd, when they saw Jesus [returning from the holy mount, His face and person yet glistening], they were greatly amazed and ran up to Him [and] greeted Him.",
  "16": "And He asked them, About what are you questioning and discussing with them?",
  "17": "And one of the throng replied to Him, Teacher, I brought my son to You, for he has a dumb spirit.",
  "18": "And wherever it lays hold of him [so as to make him its own], it dashes him down and convulses him, and he foams [at the mouth] and grinds his teeth, and he [falls into a motionless stupor and] is wasting away. And I asked Your disciples to drive it out, and they were not able [to do it].",
  "19": "And He answered them, O unbelieving generation [without any faith]! How long shall I [have to do] with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to Me.",
  "20": "So they brought [the boy] to Him, and when the spirit saw Him, at once it completely convulsed the boy, and he fell to the ground and kept rolling about, foaming [at the mouth].",
  "21": "And [Jesus] asked his father, How long has he had this? And he answered, From the time he was a little boy.",
  "22": "And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water, intending to kill him. But if You can do anything, do have pity on us and help us.",
  "23": "And Jesus said, [You say to Me], If You can do anything? [Why,] all things can be (are possible) to him who believes!",
  "24": "At once the father of the boy gave [an eager, piercing, inarticulate] cry with tears, and he said, Lord, I believe! [Constantly] help my weakness of faith!",
  "25": "Now Jesus having seen that a crowd is gathering rapidly, He rebuked the unclean [or, defiling] spirit, saying to it, \"Mute and deaf spirit,_I_ command you, come out from him, and you shall no longer enter into him!\"",
  "26": "And having cried out and having greatly torn him back and forth [fig., having thrown him into terrible convulsions], it came out. And he became as dead, with the result that many are saying that he was dead.",
  "27": "But Jesus, having taken him by the hand, lifted him up, and he stood up.",
  "28": "And when He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, \"Why were we not able to cast it out?\"",
  "29": "And He said to them, \"This kind is able to come out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.\"",
  "30": "Then having gone out from there, they were passing through Galilee, and He did not want that any should know.",
  "31": "For He was teaching His disciples, and He was saying to them, \"The Son of Humanity is being betrayed into the hands of people, and they will kill Him. And having been killed, the third day He will rise.\"",
  "32": "But they were not understanding the saying, and they were afraid to question Him.",
  "33": "And He came into Capernaum. And being in the house, He began questioning them, \"What were you* discussing on the road among yourselves?\"",
  "34": "But they were keeping silent, for on the road they discussed with one another who [is the] greatest.\"",
  "35": "And having sat down, He called the twelve and says to them, \"If anyone desires to be first, he will be last of all and a servant of all.\"",
  "36": "And having taken a young child, He set him in the middle of them. And having taken him in His arms, He said to them,",
  "37": "\"Whoever receives one like these young children in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me, does not receive Me,_but_ the One having sent Me.\"",
  "38": "Then John answered Him, saying, \"Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, who does not follow us, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow us.\"",
  "39": "But Jesus said, \"Stop preventing him, for [there] is no one who will perform a miraculous work in [or, on the basis of] My name and will soon [afterwards] be able to speak evil of Me.",
  "40": "\"For [the one] who is not against you* is for you*.",
  "41": "\"For whoever gives you* a cup of water to drink in My name because you* are Christ's, positively I say to you*, he shall by no means lose his reward.",
  "42": "\"And whoever causes one of the little [ones] believing [or, trusting] in Me to stumble [fig., to sin], it is better for him if rather a millstone [i.e. a large stone used for grinding grain] is hung around his neck, and he has been cast into the sea.",
  "43": "\"And if your hand is causing you to stumble [fig., to sin], cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled, than having your two hands, to go away into hell [Gr., gehenna], into the unquenchable fire,",
  "44": "where their worm does not come to the end [of their lives], and the fire is not extinguished.",
  "45": "\"And if your foot is causing you to stumble [fig., to sin], cut it off! It is better for you to enter into the life lame, than having your two feet to be cast into hell [Gr., gehenna], into the unquenchable fire,",
  "46": "where their worm does not come to the end [of their lives], and the fire is not extinguished.",
  "47": "\"And if your eye is causing you to stumble [fig., to sin], cast it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, than having two eyes, to be cast into the hell [Gr., gehenna] of the fire [or, the fiery hell],",
  "48": "where their worm does not come to the end [of their lives], and the fire is not extinguished.",
  "49": "\"For every [one] will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.",
  "50": "\"The salt [is] good, but if the salt becomes tasteless, by what will you season [it]? Be having salt in yourselves, and be living in peace with one another.\""
