  "1": "NOW AFTER the Sabbath, near dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.",

  "3": "His appearance was like lightning, and his garments as white as snow.",
  "4": "And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men.",
  "5": "But the angel said to the women, Do not be alarmed and frightened, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, Who was crucified.",
  "6": "He is not here; He has risen, as He said [He would do]. Come, see the place where He lay.",
  "7": "Then go quickly and tell His disciples, He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.",
  "8": "So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples.",

  "10": "Then Jesus said to them, Do not be alarmed and afraid; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.",
  "11": "While they were on their way, behold, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred.",
