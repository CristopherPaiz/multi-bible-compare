{
  "1": "WHAT SHALL we say [to all this]? Are we to remain in sin in order that God's grace (favor and mercy) may multiply and overflow?",
  "2": "Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?",
  "3": "Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?",
  "4": "We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious [power] of the Father, so we too might [habitually] live and behave in newness of life.",
  "5": "For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His, we shall also be [one with Him in sharing] His resurrection [by a new life lived for God].",
  "6": "We know that our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that [our] body [which is the instrument] of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil, that we might no longer be the slaves of sin.",
  "7": "For when a man dies, he is freed (loosed, delivered) from [the power of] sin [among men].",
  "8": "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,",
  "9": "Because we know that Christ (the Anointed One), being once raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him.",
  "10": "For by the death He died, He died to sin [ending His relation to it] once for all; and the life that He lives, He is living to God [in unbroken fellowship with Him].",
  "11": "Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken, but alive to God [living in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus.",
  "12": "Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal (short-lived, perishable) bodies, to make you yield to its cravings and be subject to its lusts and evil passions.",
  "13": "Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members [and faculties] to sin as instruments (tools) of wickedness. But offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to [perpetual] life, and your bodily members [and faculties] to God, presenting them as implements of righteousness.",
  "14": "For sin shall not [any longer] exert dominion over you, since now you are not under Law [as slaves], but under grace [as subjects of God's favor and mercy].",
  "15": "What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God's favor and mercy? Certainly not!",
  "16": "Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will, you are the slaves of him whom you obey, whether that be to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience which leads to righteousness (right doing and right standing with God)?",
  "17": "But thank God, though you were once slaves of sin, you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed.",
  "18": "And having been set free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in thought, purpose, and action).",
  "19": "I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations. For as you yielded your bodily members [and faculties] as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness, so now yield your bodily members [and faculties] once for all as servants to righteousness (right being and doing) [which leads] to sanctification.",
  "20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.",
  "21": "But then what benefit (return) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? [None] for the end of those things is death.",
  "22": "But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God, you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life.",
  "23": "For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord."
