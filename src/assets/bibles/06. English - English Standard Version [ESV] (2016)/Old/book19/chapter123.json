  "1": "A SONG OF ASCENTS.To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!",
  "2": "Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he has mercy upon us.",

  "4": "Our soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud."
