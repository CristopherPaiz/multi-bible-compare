  "InfoSobreProyecto": "This web application was created by Cristopher Paiz, with the aim of facilitating the comparison of biblical texts. The application is open source and can be found on my GitHub https://github.com/CristopherPaiz/multi-bible-compare. However, the texts provided are not under my audit, but thanks to the collaboration of many entities that provide their work for free, they are now available to you in order to make comparisons of different passages for better understanding.",
